Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 27, 2018. \nOn August 4, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines F and H. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing.

On November 30, 2020, a complete copy of the file \nof relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on December 28, 2020, and did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on February 25, 2021.  \nThe FORM included a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted \non May 29, 2019. The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to comment on the \naccuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; or \nobject to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not authenticated. I \nconclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summary by failing to respond to the \nFORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are \nexpected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old self-employed owner of an information-technology \ncompany. He has owned the company since October 2008. He also works as a network \nadministrator for a federal contractor, who is sponsoring him for a security clearance. He \nhas never married and has no children. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in September \n1996. He has never held a security clearance. \nIn December 2005, Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of felony \npossession of marijuana and cocaine, and he was sentenced to probation for two years. \nHis conviction was expunged after he successfully completed his probation. (GX 4 at 38; \nGX 5 at 2.) He stopped using cocaine after his arrest, but he continues to use marijuana \na few times a week. He told a security investigator that he was willing to stop using \nmarijuana for a job. (GX 5 at 3.) He was still using marijuana regularly when he submitted \nhis SCA. (Answer to SOR.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated, \u201cI understand that being \ngranted with a security clearance from the Department of Defense make me an agent of \nthe Federal government and I will immediately discontinue use.\u201d (GX 3 at 3.) \nApplicant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2010. \nHe did not owe any taxes for that year. He failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns and pay the taxes as required for tax years 2011 through 2018. In his SCA, he \nattributed his failure to file the returns and pay the taxes to \u201cignorance of the process and \nlack of financial plan.\u201d (GX 4 at 42-45.) He told a security investigator that he failed to file \nhis returns and pay the taxes because of his lack of steady employment. (GX 5 at 3.) He \nfiled his federal return for 2018 but has not paid the $4,137 due for that tax year.

(GX 6 at 2-3.) In his SCA, he attributed the \ndelinquencies to inability to make consistent payments. (GX 4 at 47-49.) He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other efforts to resolve \nthese debts. He provided no information about his current income and expenses. He \nprovided no evidence of efforts to find steady employment. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Apr. 20, 2016).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges a student loan placed for collection of $85,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a \nstudent loan placed for collection $40,222 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a revolving charge account past \ndue for $142 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); failure to file federal income tax returns and pay the taxes as \nrequired for tax years 2010 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); failure to file state returns and pay \nthe taxes as required for tax years 2013 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and failure to file state \nreturns and pay the taxes as required (for a different state than alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e) for \ntax years 2010, 2011, and 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The security concern under this guideline is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare recent, numerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely. His lack of steady employment is likely a condition largely beyond his control, \nalthough he submitted no evidence of efforts to find steady employment, and he submitted \nno evidence of responsible conduct, such as contacting his creditors or seeking \nprofessional help. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nDecember 1994 to about May 2019, including use after he submitted his SCA (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). It also alleges that he was arrested in January 1996, charged with felony possession \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof a controlled substance, and placed on probation for two years. The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAppendix B to the Adjudicative Guidelines prohibits granting or renewing a security \nclearance to \u201can unlawful user of a controlled substance.\u201d Since there is no evidence that \nApplicant has stopped using marijuana, Appendix B appears to apply. In addition, \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use \nis frequent and has continued after he submitted his SCA. He submitted no evidence of \ntreatment or other actions to overcome his marijuana use and no evidence of abstinence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts \nand drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 6, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR), alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information \n(AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \nGovernment, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance, \nand it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn November 19, 2020, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegation, \nand requesting a hearing.

Applicant\u2019s counsel waived the right to 15-days notice of \nhearing. The hearing was held as scheduled. I received three Government exhibits (GE \n1 - GE 3), eighteen Applicant exhibits (AE A - AE R), and the testimony of Applicant.

At the close of the \nhearing, I left the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. Within the \ntime allotted, he submitted one exhibit which I marked and admitted as AE S. I received \nthe transcript of the hearing on April 7, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 41-year-old married man with three pre-teen children.

After Applicant acknowledged shipping these vehicles to friends \nand family members, later during his testimony, he stated that he could not remember \nthe names of any of the people whom he shipped the cars. (Tr. 45) \nApplicant is active in the community. He worked in a recent election as an \nelection judge.

(HE I at 1) Authorities do not \nalways hold the police, military, or other security force personnel accountable for the \nuse of excessive or deadly force for the death of people in custody. (HE I at 2). Although \nthe Nigerian government has taken steps to root out public corruption, it remains \nendemic to all levels of government in Nigeria. (HE I at 1-2) \n \n \nTerrorism and banditry are major problems in parts of Nigeria. There have been \nepisodes of hostage taking and kidnappings for ransom targeting dual nationals who \nhave returned to Nigeria for a visit, or U.S. citizens with perceived wealth. (HE II at 2) \nTerrorist actions by groups such as Boko Haram and ISIS have contributed to the \ninternal displacement of approximately two million people in northeastern Nigeria. (HE \nIV at 3) Nigeria is committed to countering extremism, organizing programs to re-\nintegrate lower-level extremists into society, and participating on international anti-\nterrorism conferences.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Although the Nigerian government is committed to \ncountering terrorism and banditry, these problems remain pervasive in many parts of \nthe country. Of particular concern is the propensity of criminals to target Nigerian \nexpatriates who return to the country for visits. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his brother, a Nigerian citizen and resident, triggers the application of \nAG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign \ncounty if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d \nThe relevant, potentially mitigating conditions are set forth in AG \u00b6 8 as follows: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n  \nApplicant contends that his contact and communication with his brother is casual \nand infrequent. In addition, Applicant contends, in essence, that his longstanding \nrelationships in the United States and the financial and familial ties cultivated since \nliving here, mitigate any foreign influence security concern posed by his relationship \nwith his brother. While sibling relationships may not be close, as with Applicant and his \nbrother, they cannot be considered casual. There is a presumption of bonds of \nobligation, if not affection, imputed to sibling bonds. Application of the foreign influence \nmitigating conditions requires consideration of the brother\u2019s location as well as his \nprofessional activities and personal associations in Nigeria. There is nothing in the \nrecord to suggest that Applicant could not obtain this information, only that he did not. \nWithout this information, the government cannot fully assess the potential risks of this \nrelationship. The absence of information about Applicant\u2019s brother prevents application \nof any of the foreign influence mitigating conditions to this relationship. \n \n  \nApplicants have the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nclearance decision. To meet this burden, applicants, at minimum, must testify credibly. \nHere, Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible, given his evasive, contradictory testimony \nabout the cars that he bought and shipped to Nigeria between 2012 and 2013. This lack \nof credibility fatally undercuts the probative value of his remaining testimony, and \nultimately, generates doubt about his security worthiness. Given this lack of credibility \nand the mandate in the Directive that any doubt about an applicant\u2019s security interest \nmust be resolved in favor of the national security, I conclude that none of the mitigating \nconditions apply, and that Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern.

He is married and has a newly born daughter (about five months old at the date of the Brief). Applicant recently purchased his home. Since 2015, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 2 and Brief.) The SOR alleged that Applicant (1) used marijuana from about January 2011 to February 2018, including after completing his SCA in August 2017; (2) used and purchased cocaine three times from May 2012 to April 2016; and (3) used hallucinogenic mushrooms once in May 2015 and once in February 2017. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations that he expanded further in his Brief. (Items 1, 3, and Brief.) Applicant\u2019s answer and response to the FORM made the following points. First, he observed that the duration of his first and last drug usage spanned many years and those instances were \u201cfew and far between.\u201d Second, Applicant argued that his single use of marijuana during the four year clearance process was isolated and that he stopped when he realized it could affect his clearance. Third, Applicant noted that since his drug usage he has married, bought a home, and has a young child. Finally, he emphasized his community involvement and his academic accomplishments. (Brief.)

Eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 24, 2017. \nThe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on September 8, 2020, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The DOD CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within \nthe DOD as of June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 5, 2020, and elected a decision on the \nwritten record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On March 31, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items1 through 3 (Items). \nApplicant was sent the FORM on March 31, 2021, and he received the FORM on April 7, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n2021. He was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant responded to the FORM on \nApril 29, 2021. Applicant\u2019s response included a written brief (Brief) and documents of \nevidence marked 2.01 through 2.18. (Evidence). Applicant\u2019s Brief and Evidence are \nadmitted without objection. The SOR and the answer (Item 1) are the pleadings in the \ncase. Items 2 (SCA) and 3 (Responses to Interrogatories) are admitted without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 16, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old, and he holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree (2010) and a Master\u2019s \ndegree (2012). He is married and has a newly born daughter (about five months old at \nthe date of the Brief). Applicant recently purchased his home. Since 2015, he has been \nemployed by a defense contractor. (Item 2 and Brief.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant (1) used marijuana from about January 2011 to \nFebruary 2018, including after completing his SCA in August 2017; (2) used and \npurchased cocaine three times from May 2012 to April 2016; and (3) used hallucinogenic \nmushrooms once in May 2015 and once in February 2017. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted \nthose allegations with explanations that he expanded further in his Brief. (Items 1, 3, and \nBrief.) \nApplicant\u2019s answer and response to the FORM made the following points. First, he \nobserved that the duration of his first and last drug usage spanned many years and those \ninstances were \u201cfew and far between.\u201d Second, Applicant argued that his single use of \nmarijuana during the four year clearance process was isolated and that he stopped when \nhe realized it could affect his clearance. Third, Applicant noted that since his drug usage \nhe has married, bought a home, and has a young child. Finally, he emphasized his \ncommunity involvement and his academic accomplishments. (Brief.) Applicant submitted \nthe following Evidence to support his claims: \nEvidence 2.01 (photos of Applicant, his wife, and his daughter); \nEvidence 2.02 through 2.06, and 2.15 (records of Applicant\u2019s academic and \nprofessional achievements); \nEvidence 2.07 and 2.08 (records of Applicant\u2019s community workshops that he \nfounded); \nEvidence 2.09 and 2.10 (records of Applicant\u2019s volunteer work for a response \nshelter); \nEvidence 2.11 and 2.12 (records of Applicant\u2019s volunteer work for a political \ncandidate); \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEvidence 2.13 and 2.14 (records of Applicant\u2019s volunteer work for an immigration \nadvocacy organization); \nEvidence 2.16 and 2.17 (records of Applicant\u2019s participation in middle school \ncareer day events); and \nEvidence 2.18 (record of Applicant\u2019s volunteer services at a vaccination clinic). \nThis is Applicant\u2019s first experience with the security clearance process. (Item 2.) \nApplicant submitted a signed statement that comports with AG \u00b6 26(b). (Item 3.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance. As noted \nby the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528,531 (1988) (\u201cit should be \nobvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of \nDefense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance). Under \nEgan, E.O. 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be \nallowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national \nsecurity.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The \nGovernment has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR \nthat have been controverted. An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven. In addition, an \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nIn Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance \nof evidence. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.The Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, \nand a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard. ISCR \nCase No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \nDiscussion \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nUnder AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into \ndoubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25 and 26\n(setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and, \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;(2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and, \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana, cocaine, and hallucinogenic mushrooms \noccasionally, with the most recent usage being in February 2018   Facts admitted by an \napplicant in an answer to a SOR or in an interview require no further proof from the \nGovernment. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions \n[applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of \nproof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an Administrative \nJudge\u2019s findings\u201d).   \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarijuana and cocaine are Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of \nthem is regulated by the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. The knowing or intentional possession and use of any such \nsubstance is unlawful and punishable by imprisonment and or a fine. 21U.S.C.\u00a7844.  In \nan October 25, 2014 memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that \nthe use of marijuana is relevant to national security determinations, regardless of \nchanges to state laws concerning marijuana use. James R. Clapper, Director of National \nIntelligence, Memorandum: Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use \n(October 25, 2014). See also http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n(c) apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant used illegal drugs with \nvarying frequency as recently as February 2018. His behavior was neither infrequent, nor \ndid it occur that long ago, with his last use being in February 2018, just over three years \nago. I find that AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant\u2019s signed written \nstatement faithfully tracks the language of AG \u00b6 26(b). Of more importance is the record \nevidence that Applicant\u2019s life has dramatically changed since his drug-dabbling days. He \nhas become a husband, a father, and a homeowner. In addition to his impressive history \nof academic and professional accomplishments, Applicant is very active in civic and \ncommunity affairs. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n4 \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file \u2026 annual Federal \u2026 income tax returns or failure \nto pay annual Federal \u2026 income tax as required; \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic financial \nand federal income tax history as alleged. This raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), (b), (c) and (f).  \nThe next inquiry is whether any potential mitigating conditions apply. For the \nreasons set forth below, I find that none of the Guideline F potential mitigating conditions \napply in this case. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \nApplicant\u2019s SOR indebtedness runs from 2018, and it continues to this day. \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness was neither infrequent nor long ago. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThere is nothing in the record showing that Applicant has initiated and is making efforts \nto resolve his overdue debts or rectify his income tax defaults. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and (g) do not \napply. \nApplicant claimed that his indebtedness was caused by his divorce and his \nperiods of unemployment, conditions largely beyond his control. The first prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(b) applies. The next inquiry, however, is whether Applicant acted responsibly under \nthe adverse circumstances he was facing. There is nothing in the record showing that \nApplicant made any efforts to address his overdue debts. He apparently did not contact \nor otherwise reach out to his overdue creditors to advise them of the causes of his \ndelinquent debts. I cannot find that the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Therefore, I \nfind against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.v. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 sets out the security concern about personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e)(1) sets forth below potentially apply to the conduct alleged under Guideline \nE: \npersonal conduct\u2026that creates a vulnerability to  exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other \nindividual or group, including engaging on activities which, if known, \ncould affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding. \n \nI concur with the Government\u2019s contention that AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) applies and raises a \nsecurity concern. Applicant\u2019s pattern of criminal misconduct is just what is contemplated \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d). That pattern evidences questionable judgment, unreliability, \nand dishonesty. \nThe next inquiry is whether any potentially mitigating conditions apply. After a \ncareful review of the entire record, I find that none of the mitigating conditions under \nGuideline E apply in this case. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \nThe record evidence on Applicant\u2019s financial condition and his personal conduct \nraise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a \nwhole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or \nvice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.v: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E    \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

(AppX B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant smoked and purchased marijuana for a period of more than four years, \nending about a year prior to his hearing. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), and (c) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nAlthough Applicant has now provided a statement of intent to abstain from the \nuse of marijuana in the future, his knowing, illegal usage only ended about a year ago.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. In an undated response, Applicant answered \nthe SOR, admitting all of the allegations. He requested a decision without a hearing. On \nDecember 14, 2020, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Materials (FORM). \nOn January 14, 2021, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, and he was instructed to file \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nany objections, or to supplement the file within 30 days of receipt.

He graduated from high school in 1989. \nShortly after graduating, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where he served until May 1990, \nreceiving a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Item 3) He is a graphic \ndesigner who has been working with his current employer, a federal contractor, since 2019. \n(Item 3 at 12-14) \nApplicant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns from 2014 to 2018. \nAs of December 2020, these tax returns remain unfiled and the corresponding debts \nremain unpaid. (Item 2) In addition, as of December 2020, Applicant had approximately \n$20,000 in delinquent consumer debt. (Item 2) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to a home foreclosure in 2013, and \nperiods of unemployment from February and June of 2018, and from March and June of \n2019. (Item 3 at 15; Item 7 at 1) He provided no evidence of any steps that he has taken to \neither satisfy his debts, or develop payment plans, nor has he provided evidence that he \nhas filed his income tax returns, or made any income tax payments. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \nApplicant\u2019s extensive delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal or state income tax returns, or to pay his \nfederal or state income taxes, as required, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to \nfile or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to  pay \nannual federal, state, or local income tax, as required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nApplicant\u2019s bouts of unemployment may have exacerbated his financial \nproblems. Conversely, he already was in debt and behind on his income tax filings \nand payments by the time he experienced his first period of unemployment in 2018. \nMoreover, he provided no evidence of any steps that he has taken to rehabilitate his \nfinancial situation. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions \napply. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors when I evaluated the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and they do not warrant a favorable \nconclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.bb:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

She \ndid not ignore any creditors. She admits that taking out loans and refinancing was not the \nwisest thing to do, but she wanted to keep paying her bills and avoid bankruptcy. She \nwas adamant in her testimony that \u201cshe has worked her way up\u201d and has been in the field \nwith a security clearance for 30 years. She had no one to help pay her bills. (Tr. ) \nAs she stated at the hearing, she initially worked to resolve her financial problems \nwith her mortgage through a debt management company, and presented information and \ncorrespondence from the mortgage company informing Applicant that they had not heard \nfrom the debt management company. (AX A-B) Applicant read articles on financial \nmatters, but did not take an official course at this time. By 2020, after a few years, she \nrealized that no progress was being made in paying off her debts or assisting with the \nmortgage issue. (SOR 1.a) \nShe then obtained the help and counsel of a non-profit local housing association \nwho helps people with mortgage problems, especially in these challenging times, for no \ncost. Neither debt was alleged in the SOR, but Department Counsel introduced \ninformation about a debt that is relevant to an examination of Applicant\u2019s actions in \nresponse to financial problems. Applicant has resolved the aforementioned accounts from \nearlier years. In addition, she was candid and credible in that she borrowed some money \nto pay bills and has paid the money to those she owed. (Tr. 45) \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant showed she has paid or \notherwise resolved the debts by payment plans. She is also making monthly payments or \nhas established a payment plan to resolve the remaining debts \nThe $42,005 180 past-due amount for her home mortgage account at SOR 1.a \narose when Applicant\u2019s unemployment started in 2017. Applicant purchased a condo in \n1991 for about $96,500, and she made a down payment. At that time, she could afford \nher mortgage payment. (Tr. 79, 42, 51) Applicant\u2019s last payment was in June 2019. This \nwas from advice from the debt management company. (AX A-B) The balance on the \nmortgage is $264,157, due to refinancing. It also appears from the credit report that there \nwas a \u201cballoon payment\u201d of $104,720. Applicant asked for several modifications, but she \nwas denied. She was not allowed to make partial payments, and the full payments she \nmade were returned to her. She was relying on the debt management company to deal \nwith the mortgage company, but apparently they did nothing to follow up with requests \nfrom the mortgage company. (AX B) This resulted in a large waste of time and money for \nthe Applicant. She acknowledged that she was in arrears at the time in 2017. The debt \nmanagement company continued to advise her to continue to make requests for \nrefinancing. (Tr. 10) At that time, she had a permanent job and wanted to pay her current \nmonthly mortgage payment. The company would not accept any payments. Applicant did \nnot want to file for bankruptcy. The debt management company advised her by not paying \nthey could get a special waiver for foreclosure. (AX B) The home did not go to foreclosure. \nThe non-profit is still assisting the Applicant by working with the mortgage company and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto negotiate a settlement so that she can pay her monthly mortgage and an amount on \nthe arrearages.

(Tr. 33) Applicant worked \nwith the creditor and provided a temporary payment arrangement which started in \nJanuary 2021. The monthly payment is $155. The recent account history shows a \nprincipal balance of $10,883. (AX G) She is current on this plan. \nSOR 1.c alleges a collection account in the approximate amount of $1,326. \nApplicant was not aware of this account, but when she contacted the company she \nlearned it was purchased from another bank. She did not recall the account, but she set \nup payments to close the account. The account will be paid off in March 2021. (tr. 61) \nSOR 1.d alleges a charged-off account in the approximate amount of $773. \nApplicant submitted information that she was paying $67.58 monthly. The credit bureau \nreport confirms that the account is current, with zero balance. Her last payment was in \nDecember 2020. \nSOR 1.e alleges a 2019 judgment in the approximate amount of $1,704. The \naccount is current. (AX D, GX 4) \nApplicant is now actively working with the non-profit housing assistance group to \nnegotiate the resolve the home mortgage in SOR 1.a, (Tr. 81) Her current salary is \n$86,700, and she has a small monthly pension of $97. (Tr.44) She has a retirement \naccount with about $10,000. Her checking account has money in it ($8,000), and she is \nable to make her monthly mortgage payment of $1,600, if allowed. Applicant is current on \nher 2012 car loan, which will end next year. (Tr. 46) When asked about her income taxes, \nshe answered that she is on an installment plan with the IRS paying $154 a month. Her \ntax return was completed by someone other than herself. (Tr. 77) \nWhen questioned by the Government, Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to all questions \nregarding any vacations, large purchase items, or extravagant items. (Tr. 50) Applicant \nacknowledged that the condo was built in 1975, and over the years she has had many \nexpensive repairs as well an increasing condominium fee. She has plumbing problems \nand a furnace issue. When a large ticket item arose, she took out a second mortgage or \na loan. (Tr. 56) She now realizes that was probably not the best solution. She was na\u00efve \nand wanted to maintain her condo and make all necessary repairs. She was young and \nnot educated in financial matters. She was quite candid and stated that she did not make \na substantial amount of money until later in her career. However, she did the best she \ncould to maintain her home and pay bills. She also did not realize that some of the interest \nrates for a loan were as high as 20%. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred numerous delinquent or past-\ndue debts in 2008, 2012, and 2017. The largest debt is her home mortgage which is now \n180 days late with a balance of more than $46,000. This information reasonably raises a \nsecurity concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 \n18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. The Government \nacknowledged that the account in SOR 1.-1.e, although in collection status, are current \nwith Applicant\u2019s payment plans or are resolved. The debts listed on the SOR resulted \nfrom unemployment or underemployment. She had several intermittent contract \npositions, but did not find consistent full-time employment until 2020. Applicant started to \naddress her debts through a debt management company; however, she did not see \nresults from that effort. She is now working with a non-profit housing group that helps \npeople with mortgage problems. She has tried to modify her mortgage loans and was \nadvised by the debt management company not to pay. Applicant stands ready to pay here \nmonthly $1,600 mortgage payment, but the company will not accept the amount due to \narrearages. \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to address her debts occurred before the SOR. As she finally found \nsteady work, she began contacting creditors. Her initial efforts with the debt management \ncompany were hindered by the ineffectiveness of the company. She acknowledged other \nearlier debts in 2008 and 2012 (not alleged in the SOR) that she has paid. Was Applicant \nacting in a reasonable manner in this situation? A component is whether she maintained \ncontact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \nHer earlier credit reports confirm that she has resolved or is now repaying most of her \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ndebts, and she is still working with the home mortgage. She meets all of her current \nobligations in addition to repaying her past-due debts. All of the foregoing supports \napplication of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions. \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not the result of poor financial management or \nother misconduct. She has acted responsibly given the circumstances in which she found \nherself, and it is likely she will resolve her remaining debts. The security concerns under \nthis guideline are mitigated. I also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-\nperson factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). In addition to Applicant\u2019s long career in the defense \nindustry, her history of holding a security clearance and earlier credit reports support the \nposition that she has \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d Her efforts to resolve her debts despite limited \nresources and unforeseen events, speaks well of her judgement and reliability. Applicant \nis not required to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. She has evidenced a serious intent to resolve her mortgage. A fair and \ncommonsense assessment of all of the record as a whole shows the concerns in the SOR \nare mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F: \n7 \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to continue access to classified information.

Applicant admits that he falsified his SCA in answer to \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial \nRecord Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts\u201d by failing to disclose any of the above, \nbefore mentioned, past-due debts. (Item 3 at pages 37~39.) This allegation is found \nagainst Applicant. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n3 \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nNone of these are applicable. Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the \nfinancial concerns set out in the SOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h. \nand 1.j. against Applicant. \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \n\n \n5 \n \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of his SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant admits intentionally falsifying his SCA. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nestablished. \n \n \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt \nupon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant has not provided sufficient information in this record \nto demonstrate that he has met his burden of proof to mitigate his adverse personal \nconduct. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA, \nand he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

The case was assigned to me on February 17, 2021. \nOn March 12, 2021, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for April 2, 2021. \nApplicant reported in late March 2021 that he was soon leaving employment with his \nclearance sponsor and did not want to process his case. The April 2, 2021 hearing was \ntherefore cancelled by mutual agreement. In mid-April, 2021, however, Applicant reported \nthat he still needed a clearance, with a different employer. His case was then rescheduled. \n(Tr. 4-6, 9, 81-84) \nOn May 4, 2021, DOHA issued a new notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for \nMay 11, 2021, that date having been arranged with Applicant by e-mail on or about April \n20, 2021. (Tr. 4-6) The same day, I issued a Case Management Order to the parties by \ne-mail. It concerned procedural matters relating to the health and safety of the hearing \nparticipants due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The parties were ordered to submit and \nexchange their proposed exhibits in advance of the hearing, and they did so. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-6, all of which were admitted without objection but for GE 2, \nthe unauthenticated summary of Applicant\u2019s background interview, which was not \nadmitted. (Tr. 17-20) Applicant testified and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-F. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits were all admitted without objection. I held the post-hearing record \nopen until May 21, 2021, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \ninformation. (Tr. 116) He timely submitted three documents, which were marked as AE \nG, AE H, and AE I and admitted without objection. They are identified in the Facts section, \nbelow. Department Counsel\u2019s May 17, 2021 e-mail in response is placed in the record as \na hearing exhibit, and I have considered Department Counsel\u2019s argument. The record \nclosed on May 21, 2021, and DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 24, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, each with a brief \nexplanation. He referenced exhibits in his Answer but did not provide any at that time. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He was married from 1997 to 2011, when he and his wife \ndivorced. (Tr. 34-35) They have one son, now age 24. He also has a son, born in March \n2012. His son lives with his mother on Guam. (Tr. 35, 87-88; GE 1 at 20). Applicant \nattested that he is the sole source of income for his younger son and his mother. (Tr. 96-\n97) Applicant has not remarried. (Tr. 35) He lives with his girlfriend. (Tr. 42) \nApplicant earned his Bachelor\u2019s degree online from state university O in October \n2008 and continued advanced studies with the same institution until December 2009.

(GE 1 at 30-32) \nApplicant served for 20 years on active duty in the U.S. Navy, retiring in December \n2014 as an E-6 (petty officer first class). Beginning in January 2013 or January 2014, he \nalso worked the night shift with a defense contractor on the same Navy base, until he \nretired from active duty. (Tr. 34; GE 1 at 12-14) He continued to work at the base until \nApril 2021. \nFrom late 2017 to January 2019, Applicant also worked as a ride-share driver at \nnight. (Tr. 45-46) He left that job when he began working the day shift for his current \nemployer, another defense contractor. He now works for that defense contractor full time, \nhis current clearance sponsor. (Tr. 81-84; AE H) He works as a logistics analyst, and \nearns an annual salary of $82,000 (Tr. 33, 70) He also receives $1,526 in monthly \ndisability and $730 in monthly retirement. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant has had a security \nclearance since early in his Navy career. (Tr. 30, 43; GE 1 at 28) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($8,889) and 1.c ($7,445) are student loan accounts with state \nuniversity O that are allegedly in collection status. The account numbers are not listed in \nthe SOR allegations. Applicant denied the allegations, asserting that the debts had been \npaid. (Tr. 35-36, 40-41, 54-57, 63) \nA July 2017 credit report lists two student loan accounts with state university O as \n\u201cPays as Agreed.\u201d (GE 6 at 6) An August 2018 credit report lists both accounts as having \na zero balance. One of them (Acct. 336) says \u201ctransferred and sold.\u201d The second (Acct. \n337) says, \u201cClosed or paid account. Zero Balance.\u201d (GE 5 at 3) However, an April 2019 \ncredit report lists both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c as in collection, with the amount owed as \nalleged ($8,889 and $7,445, respectfully) (GE 4 at 2) A January 2021 credit report lists \nboth accounts as having a zero balance, and reflect the status of \u201cPays as Agreed.\u201d (GE \n3 at 7) An April 2021 credit report provided by Applicant shows similar information. (AE D \nat 57-59; excerpts at AE B, AE C) \n \nApplicant also provided a pay stub from November 2018 showing two \ngarnishments for student loan payments (reflecting when the garnishments began) and \nanother pay stub from May 2020, showing a zero balance on the two garnishments (to \nshow when they ended). (Tr. 60-61, 68-69) The student loan creditor(s) are not identified \non the pay stubs. (AE E; Tr. 56-57) Applicant also provided checks from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education reflecting payment to him of \u201cfederal student loan refunds\u201d \nbecause of certain overpayments he made. (AE G; Tr. 62, 66-67). He testified that he no \nlonger owes student loans, either to the federal government, or to state university O. (Tr. \n63) SOR \u00b6 1.b and 1.c are resolved for Applicant, as the government\u2019s own evidence \nshows no balance is due. (Tr. 59-60) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($27,224) is a consumer credit-card debt with a bank that caters to U.S. \nmilitary personnel, in collection.

(Tr. 36-40) \nApplicant attempted several years ago to negotiate a settlement but was not able \nto do so. (Tr. 50-53) More recently, in April 2021, he negotiated a settlement to pay $1,127 \na month for 12 months (for $14,000). (AE A; Tr. 51-53) Applicant had made two $1,127 \npayments on the settlement by the time the record closed. (AE F, AE I) Given the nature \nof the agreement and the singular nature of this debt, I believe these payments will \ncontinue and the debt will be resolved in due course. SOR \u00b6 1.a is being paid and will \nbe resolved under the settlement agreement. \nApplicant attributed his debts to a divorce. He said he was \u201cstuck with all the \nfinancial hardship,\u201d while his wife assumed none of the financial liability. He said he has \nmade efforts to resolve his debts. (Tr. 30-32) He testified that after the divorce, he had \nmultiple credit cards to pay down. He said that the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.a was the last one. \n(Tr. 76) \nApplicant\u2019s largest monthly expenses are his cars. Applicant bought one car in \nApril 2020, and financed about $27,000 of the purchase price. He said the monthly \npayments are $513. Credit reports in the record show several months of current \npayments. (GE 3 at 4; AE D at 34) He bought a second car a month later, for $56,000, \nwith monthly payments of $924.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The following AGs are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.b and 1.c, his two delinquent student loans with state \nuniversity O, asserting that they had been paid. While this proved correct, they were \ndelinquent on a previous credit report, from April 2019. SOR \u00b6 1.a, the delinquent credit-\ncard debt, is also established. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant denied the two student loan debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. These debts \nwere paid, albeit through garnishment, between 2018 and 2020, and credit reports from \n2021 submitted by both parties show no balance is due on either debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies \nto these debts, which are both resolved. \nThis leaves SOR \u00b6 1.a, a $27,000 credit-card debt in collection. Applicant has an \nagreement to settle the account for $14,000 over the next 12 months, and has begun \nmaking monthly payments. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some application because SOR \u00b6 1.a is the only delinquent debt \nremaining (out of three in the SOR). Applicant\u2019s debt is therefore rather isolated. However, \nthe debt remains ongoing, so AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) also has some application, since Applicant\u2019s debts were due, in part, \nto his divorce. Applicant is also credited with the fact that he worked two jobs for several \nyears to make ends meet. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) also applies. Applicant has participated in credit counseling, albeit \nduring his marriage several years ago. He also keeps a budget. His debts are also under \ncontrol. SOR \u00b6 1.a is the only debt left in the SOR, and Applicant has an agreed-upon \nand reasonable plan in place to resolve it. He purchased two cars in 2020. Importantly, \nhowever, the credit reports establish that his payments remain current. His current credit \nreports also do not show any other delinquencies. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are being \nresolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) also has some application. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were resolved through \ngarnishment, a debt resolution mechanism that does not establish good-faith efforts by \nthe applicant. However, Applicant\u2019s student loan debts were only briefly delinquent, and \nthey were being resolved prior to issuance of the SOR \u2013 timing which weighs in his favor \n(as does the fact that the student loan debts show no balance owed). The timing of \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a is also a factor to be considered, as the settlement \nand his subsequent payments are both recent. However, there is no requirement that \ndebts be paid off in any particular order, or that they be fully paid off, to establish \nmitigation. An applicant need only establish a reasonable plan to pay off his debts, and \ntake some concrete steps towards execution of that plan through documented evidence \nof payments. Applicant has done this. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. In particular, I considered the strong character \nreference letter provided by the president and CEO of Applicant\u2019s employer, as well as \nApplicant\u2019s many years with a clearance, both in the Navy and the defense industry. I \nalso considered the record evidence supporting a finding that Applicants\u2019 debts occurred, \nat least in part, after his divorce, and he worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. His \ncurrent credit reports do not show that any other delinquent debts are evident. His debts \nare being resolved and are under control. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

The FORM included seven items of evidence listed on page 1 of the \nFORM. He received the FORM on June 9, 2021. The FORM recommended he file \nobjections, submit additional information or provide explanations within 30 days of \nreceiving the FORM. Applicant submitted a response (2 credit bureau reports dated June \n2021) to the FORM on June 30, 2021. DOHA received the documentation (two credit \nreports) on July 1, 2021. The response, which Department Counsel had no objection to, \nwas entered into evidence. The FORM was assigned to me on August 30, 2021. \nRulings on Evidence \nAt the top of page two of the FORM, the Government advised Applicant that he \ncould make corrections to the April 20, 2019 PSI to improve the exhibit\u2019s clarity and \naccuracy.

Because he had a \nrent-free arrangement with his son, he would have extra money to pay off his delinquent \ndebts. (Item 2; Item 7 at 10) \nHowever, Applicant indicated in his December 2020 answer to the SOR that he \nchanged his mind about repaying the delinquent debts. He concluded that establishing \nrepayment plans with the listed creditors would essentially set him back financially. He \nstated, \u201cI do not have any plans to pay this debt off anytime soon,\u201d and bankruptcy is not \nan option because of the age of the debts. (Item 2) \nUnder Section 26 of his March 2019 e-QIP (Item 3), Applicant disclosed that the \ndelinquent debts were caused by losing his employment in 2015. He explained that he \nresolved two delinquent debts after judgments had been filed against him. (Item 3 at 11-\n16, 33) Applicant contends that he paid off the first judgment (unlisted) in May 2018 by \nwage garnishment. He avers that the second judgment (SOR 1.a) was dismissed by the \ncourt in January 2019 because the collection agency did not file the requisite legal \ndocumentation. Though he presented no evidence to support his claim, the May 2021 \ncredit report does not list the SOR 1.a debt. (Item 6; Item 7 at 4-5) \nMost of the listed debts in the SOR were credit card accounts that became \ndelinquent in 2014. See credit reports in Items 4, 5, and 6; Item 7 at 5-9. However, SOR \n1.s became delinquent in March 2015. SOR 1.r and 1.t became delinquent in 2017, and \n1.u, in April 2019. Applicant has never received financial counseling or debt consolidation \nservices. While he encountered sudden unemployment in February 2015, he resumed \nemployment in July of that year, though he his pay was much less. He submitted no \nevidence demonstrating that he contacted any of his creditors to explain the sudden \nchange of his financial status in 2015, or to negotiate a settlement plan, or to establish a \nrepayment plan under modified terms, or to otherwise resolve the debts after they became \ndelinquent. While the delinquent accounts listed in the SOR do not appear on Applicant\u2019s \nJune 2021 credit reports, he provided no evidence to show what he has done to clear up \nhis credit problems, and how he will have all financial issues fixed by 2022 (June 2021 \nResponse to FORM), other than to wait for the debts to be removed from his credit reports. \nThere is no evidence showing that Applicant uses a budget to monitor his finances. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that he \nadmits or denies. The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a \nfavorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, \nsubstance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be \nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as \nit may result from criminal activity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties that is confirmed by his April 2019 \nPSI, the April and November 2019 credit bureau reports, the May 2021 credit report, and \nApplicant\u2019s December 2020 answer to the SOR. Except for the SOR 1.a account, which \nApplicant claims was dismissed, and not listed in the May 2021 credit bureau report, the \n21 delinquent accounts total $28,173. After stating in April 2019 that his rent-free living \narrangement would allow him to begin repaying the delinquent debts, seven months later \nhe stated that he did not intend to address the delinquent debts \u201canytime soon.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nWhile most of the listed debts in the SOR have been delinquent for more than \nsix years, four accounts changed to a delinquent status after 2015. Applicant\u2019s failure to \naddress these listed debts continues to raise doubt about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial picture in February 2015 was detrimentally affected by \ncircumstances beyond his control. His job was suddenly eliminated. Though he found \nwork in July 2015, his earnings were dramatically reduced. While he realizes some \nmitigation because of the unanticipated loss of employment, he provided no evidence to \ndemonstrate he acted reasonably to resolve the past-due debts. In sum, AG \u00b6 20(c) has \nminimal application to the circumstances of this case. No mitigation is available to \nApplicant under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he submitted no evidence of a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerationsin \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n              \n   \n \n                  \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has been married to his second wife since 2000. \nHe has four children and a stepdaughter. After working 26 years for one employer, his job \nwas unexpectedly eliminated in February 2015 and he was unemployed until July 2015. \nHe exercised good judgment by negotiating a HLM to keep his home. However, he \nstopped paying his other delinquent debts and indicated in December 2020 that he would \nnot be addressing the past-due accounts anytime soon. Applicant\u2019s failure to act on the \ndelinquent debts appears to signal his choice to not repay his debt and wait until his debts \nare removed from his credit report. Even though an applicant may decide to ignore his \ndebts until they become legally unenforceable because the statute of limitations has run, \nthe decision does not equate to a good-faith effort to repay creditors as defined by AG \u00b6 \n20(d). Having weighed the evidence from a commonsense point of view, Applicant has \nnot overcome the security concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:              \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a       \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b-1.u       \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on November 30, 2020, \nand he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a principal engineer with his current employer since June 2009. He is a 1981 high \nschool graduate, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1985, as well as a master\u2019s degree \nin 1997. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was granted a secret clearance \nin 2004. Applicant was married in 1994. He has two children, born in 1996 and 1999. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. He used marijuana on annual camping \ntrips with old college friends, on at least three or four occasions, from about September \n2014 until at least October 2017. He reported that he generally used it for recreation while \nhis friends were doing so, so he joined in. The marijuana relaxed him. (Item 4 \u2013 SF 86, \nat 31; Item 5 \u2013 Enhanced Subject Interview, at 3-4) When he used marijuana, he denied \nthat he ever did so within 48 hours of going to work. He claims that he has no intent to \nuse marijuana in the future. (Item 4, at 31; Item 5, at 3) Although he denied that his \nmarijuana use occurred while he held a security clearance, he actually did so because he \nhas held a security clearance since 2004. (Item 3, at 31-33) Although Applicant\u2019s son \nuses marijuana, Applicant denied ever using marijuana with him.

(Item 5, at 4) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. He used marijuana, a \ncontrolled substance, on annual camping trips with old college friends, on at least three \nor four occasions, from about September 2014 until at least October 2017. During that \nentire period, he held a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nNeither condition applies. Applicant, a security clearance holder, used marijuana \nduring annual camping trips with old college friends on three or four occasions from \nSeptember 2014 until at least October 2017. He claimed he has not used marijuana since \nOctober 2017. He did not consider his use to be regular use, and he never used it anytime \nwithin 48 hours of going to work. He stated that he will not do so again. Applicant has \nnever received treatment and counseling as a result of his illegal use of controlled \nsubstances. Neither the circumstances of his use of marijuana, nor his claim that he will \nnot do so again, constitutes evidence to indicate that it is unlikely to recur. To his credit, \nhe was open about his use of marijuana when he completed his SF 86, and for that \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncandor, he is given credit. However, other than his acknowledgments of use, \naccompanied by the period of abstinence, he has provided no evidence of actions taken \nto overcome his marijuana problem. He has not specifically disassociated himself from \nhis marijuana-using college friends/campers; he failed to indicate that he is avoiding the \ncamping environment where the marijuana was used; and he has not cracked down of \nhis marijuana-using son. Furthermore, his simple comment that he will not use marijuana \nagain, falls short of constituting a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, and acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, after repeated annual marijuana use while holding a security clearance, \nhis most recent drug involvement and substance misuse was in October 2017. Continued \nabstinence is to be encouraged, but the relatively brief period of such abstinence is \nconsidered insufficient to conclude that the abstinence will continue. Applicant\u2019s claimed \nnew compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, is in stark contrast to his cavalier \nattitude towards those same laws, rules, and regulations. His use of marijuana while \nholding a security clearance, despite knowing that such use was prohibited by both the \nGovernment and his employer, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 57-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a principal engineer with his \ncurrent employer since June 2009. He is a 1981 high school graduate, and received a \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1985, as well as a master\u2019s degree in 1997. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2004. When completing his SF 86, he was candid in acknowledging that he \nhad used marijuana in the past. He claims that he no longer intends to use it in the future. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. He used marijuana, a \ncontrolled substance, on annual camping trips with old college friends, on at least three \nor four occasions, from about September 2014 until at least October 2017. During that \nentire period, he held a security clearance. Applicant has never received treatment and \ncounseling as a result of his illegal use of controlled substances. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is a high school graduate and has some college education. He is \nnot married and does not have any children. \nApplicant has delinquent debt totaling approximately $55,000.

(Item 8 at 8) He provided no \nevidence that he has started paying these delinquent debts. As of the date of the interview \nwith the investigative agent in 2019, he had not participated in any financial counseling. \nIn 2013, Applicant was charged with felony embezzlement after being caught on \ncamera stealing a cell phone from a store where he worked. (Item 6 at 2) Subsequently, he \npleaded guilty to the lesser charge of misdemeanor embezzlement of property and \nreceived a deferred sentence of two years, and was ordered to complete 20 hours of \ncommunity service. (Item 6 at 3) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . .  An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. \n \n Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts trigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s theft \nfrom his employer triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial \npractices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, \nmortgage fraud, filing deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of \ntrust.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \nApplicant submitted no evidence that he has begun satisfying these debts, or \nthat he has begun developing any payment plans. He provided no evidence \nsubstantiating his denial of subparagraphs 1.k and subparagraphs 1.n through 1.p. \nAs of 2019, he had not begun any financial counseling. I conclude that none of the \nfinancial considerations apply to the financial delinquencies alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r. \nArguably, mitigating condition 20(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s arrest, alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.s, given that it was isolated, and occurred eight years ago. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s significant, longstanding, and continuing problems with \ndelinquent debt render subparagraph 20(a) inapplicable. Ultimately, I conclude that \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions, particularly with respect to whether the embezzlement charge \nposes an ongoing security risk. These factors do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.

A Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nwas issued under Guideline F, financial considerations, due to two delinquent debts that \ntotal in excess of $33,000. His unsubstantiated reassurances that he would address the \ntwo delinquent debts were insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcern. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 21, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The \nDoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nIn Applicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR allegations he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn June 9, 2021, DOHA issued a Notice of DCS Video Teleconference Hearing \nscheduling a hearing that was conducted on June 16, 2021. \nSix Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 6) and six Applicant exhibits (Ex. A - F) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open following the hearing \nto allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. On June 17, 2021, Applicant sent \nan email stating he intended to obtain information from the credit union. Neither \ninformation from the credit union nor any other additional documentation was received. \nApplicant testified at the hearing, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 28, \n2021. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old and is working as a subcontractor procurer for a defense \ncontractor. He is seeking to maintain a clearance. He was married from December 1994 \nthrough September 2010. He pays $1,000 a month child support for his two daughters \nages 16 and 13. (Ex. D, Tr. 26) He is current on his support payments. He pays $500 \nmonthly for his children\u2019s schooling, which is his half of the monthly $1,000 tuition. (Tr. \n66) In the past two years, he paid $4,000 for his oldest daughter\u2019s braces and pays $137 \nmonthly for his younger daughter\u2019s braces. (Tr. 66)  \nApplicant has a commendable military record. Applicant is a major (O-4) in the \nstate Army National Guard as an assistant operations (ops) officer. (Tr. 19) He served on \nactive duty from April 1990 through July 1993. He was deployed to Kuwait from June \n2017 to March 2018. He was deployed to Iraq and also deployed to Afghanistan from \nMarch 2011 through April 2012. (Tr. 11, 19) In early 2021, he received his 20-year letter \nentitling him to an Army retirement at the appropriate time. (Tr. 65) From 1997 to 2000, \nhe worked as a police officer. (Tr. 73) He has received a Bronze Star, two Army \nCommendation Medals, an Army Achievement Medal, an Afghanistan Campaign Medal \nwith two campaign stars, an Iraq Campaign Medal with two campaign stars, a state Medal \nof Merit, a state Faithful Service Medal, and a state Federal Service Medal (2nd  award), \nand various other awards and decorations. (Ex. E, Ex. F. Tr. 75-75)  \nApplicant had a one-year contract for employment with a company. He left that \ncompany in September 2016 and in October 2016 started pre-deployment training for the \ndeployment to Kuwait. (Tr. 28) The pre-deployment amounted to approximately two \nweeks of pay per month.

(Tr. \n33) He filed a complaint and his employer said they were giving him a paycheck and did \nnot understand the problem. At that point, he left the company, which was called a \nvoluntary layoff. (Tr. 33) He then attended a bartending academy and took some full-time \nand part-time jobs as a bartender. He had some full-time employment with the National \nGuard. He obtained some Active Duty Operational Support (ADOS) orders, which are \nspecial orders for tours lasting from six months to a year. (Tr. 38) From November 2012 \nthrough October 2016, he was an Operations Officer working at the National Guard \nReserves Headquarters for an engineering brigade.

Prior to his deployment to Afghanistan he was working for his \ncurrent employer. In April 2012, when he returned from the deployment he was again \nhired by his current employer. (Tr. 30) However, although rehired, he had no job, no desk, \nno computer just an empty cubicle. He was told he could be someone else\u2019s assistant, \nwhich was disappointing because he had eight years\u2019 experience doing the job. (Tr. 31) \nHe bought his concerns to his senior manager, who was supportive, and told him the \ncompany had future plans for him. \nIn June 2015, when there was no additional Guard duty available, Applicant \nobtained a full-time job that lasted three or four months. (Tr. 40) That job paid $40,000 a \nyear. At that time he received a subpoena for back child support. (Tr. 42) It was at this \ntime he started using his credit cards for living expenses. From February 2016 to \nSeptember 2016, he was hired by a company for a limited time contract. (Tr. 43) \nApplicant was unemployed from 2013 to 2016. (Tr. 19) In May 2018, he returned \nto a position in the procurement of subcontractors with his previous DoD contractor. (Tr. \n19, 26) In addition to his DoD contractor pay, he receives monthly pay for the National \nGuard time he performs. (Tr. 24) \nApplicant had two charged-off debts: a $25,777 credit union debt, which he \nadmitted owing and a $7,936 Ford Motor Credit Corporation (FMCC) debt due to a \nrepossessed truck. (Ex. 4, Ex. 5, Ex. 6) He denied the FMCC debt in his SOR response. \nHe disputes the amount the creditor says is owed following the repossession. (Tr. 54) The \nlast payment he made on the credit union debt was in 2016 or 2017 when he deployed to \nKuwait. (Tr. 47) These are the only two delinquent accounts he has. (Tr. 62) \nApplicant listed both delinquent obligations when he completed his May 2017, \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing. (Ex. 1) He was questioned about \nthese debts during an October 2018 Enhanced Subject Interview. (Ex. 2) He stated he \nwas making payment on his credit union debt as he was able. No documentation of any \npayment was provided during or after the hearing. In his May 2020 response to written \ninterrogatories he indicated he had talked to the collection service for the credit union \ndebt and informed them he would \u201ccoordinate a payback plan as soon as [he] had paid \noff other credit card debts.\u201d (Ex. 3) As of May 2020, his monthly net remainder (monthly \nincome less monthly expenses and payments) was $1,163.

In 2016, his car \nand his truck were repossessed, and he had to go to court due to unpaid child support. \n(Tr. 45, 47) \nApplicant had two to three years when he was unemployed or underemployed \nfollowing his time with a DoD contractor. The income during this time was less than he \nearned on military deployments. (Tr. 16) During this period, he was living off his credit \ncards and accumulated a good deal of debt. He used all available credit on the credit \ncards. (Tr. 23) In 2016, he had to use his credit card to pay a $4,000 child support debt. \n(Tr. 17) On his May 2017 e-QIP he indicated he was $7,000 behind on his child support \npayments for the period of January 2015 through July 2015. (Tr. 60) He has since brought \nhis child support payments current. He stated: \nI had to use credit cards to pay for rent, the auto loan, sometimes the \ngroceries, utilities. Everything I could where I couldn\u2019t make up for it up with \nwhat I was earning. My paychecks I earned with other jobs were about half \nof what I was making. (Tr. 17, 44) \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s credit union debt, he incurred an American Express card \ndebt. He also had another bank credit card, which was locked in 2017 by the creditor for \nbeing behind on his payments. (Tr. 60) He believes he owes approximately $2,400 on the \nbank credit card account down from a balance of $9,000. (Ex. A, Ex. B, Tr. 23) For six \nmonths in 2018 and 2019, he made $500 a month payments on this credit card debt. (Tr. \n63) This bank credit card is the only card that he uses, but he is making payment on two \nother credit cards and intended to initiate a repayment plan on the credit union account. \n(Tr. 23, 25) He has approximately $1,000 in his savings account and $1,000 on his debit \ncard. (Tr. 23) His bank account sometimes dips to $1,000 and has recently been as high \nas $5,000. (Tr. 67) The account balance varies depending on how much training he is \ndoing with the National Guard.  \nIn October 2014, Applicant leased for 36 months a 2013 F150 pickup truck when \nhe returned from his deployment to Afghanistan. (Tr. 50) The original balance on the lease \nwas $19,183. (Ex. A, Ex. 4) His monthly truck payment was $400. He was current on his \nmonthly payment through March 2016. (Ex. A) He was unable to continue making his \nmonthly payments, and in September 2016, the truck was repossessed after three \nmonths of nonpayment. (Ex. A, Tr. 53) He attempted to work with the Ford Motor Credit. \nHe wanted to voluntarily return the vehicle and the creditor stated that if he did so it would \nstill be considered a repossession, and he would be responsible for paying the balance \non the loan. (Tr. 17) The truck was repossessed, sold, and Applicant was required to pay \nthe creditor the balance owed on the truck. (Tr. 18) \nFollowing the resale of the vehicle, Applicant received one or two letters \ndemanding payment on the balance of the loan. He asserts he has not heard recently \nfrom Ford Motor Credit. (Tr. 54) He asserts he received no follow-up letters, no telephone \ncalls, and no emails following the initial letters demanding payment. He has made no \nprogress on the repossession debt and has had no contact with the creditor. (Tr. 18) He \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintended to address his other debts before addressing the repossession debt. (Tr. 78)The \ntruck repossession was the only vehicle repossession he has ever had. (Tr. 59) \nAt the hearing Applicant stated as to the vehicle repossession debt: \nI have no idea what to do with [that]. I\u2019ll probably make, you know, take the \ninitiative and contact Ford and see where it is and where they\u2019ve rolled that \ndebt off to or who\u2019s purchased that debt. I have no idea where that debt \nresides right now . . . and no one\u2019s ever contacted me about that the Ford \nMotor Credit debt since I bought it in 2016. (Tr. 24-25) \nApplicant has been in contact with the credit union. He was deployed to Kuwait \nfrom June 2017 to 2018. After returning from deployment and returning to his work with \nthe DoD contractor, he was in a position to stabilize his debt. (Tr. 18) The day before the \nhearing, he contacted the law firm collecting the credit card debt and asserted he has \nestablished a repayment plan. The plan requires him to pay $100 per month, which he \nintends to raise to $250 per month next year. (Tr. 18, 21) \nApplicant acknowledged the credit union debt and stated: \nI should have, admittedly, I admit, I should have approached and worked \nout something with the [ ] credit union earlier. I really didn\u2019t want to do it. I \nwanted to just table that. It wasn\u2019t going anywhere. We weren\u2019t making any \ncontact but through phone and email and letters. (Tr. 24)  \nApplicant asserted he told the credit union that as soon as he had other debts paid \noff, he \u201cwould shift to that one.\u201d (Tr. 24) However, his intention was to simply let it sit. The \ndebt was not going anywhere and he would \u201cchip away at that when [he] could.\u201d (Tr. 24) \nHe said he had maintained contact with the collection agency on behalf of the creditor \nreminding him about the debt. (Tr. 49) He received calls from the creditor concerning the \ndebt following his deployment to Kuwait. (Tr. 49) \nApplicant asserts he had good credit and timely paid his debts until his divorce and \nperiod of unemployment. The divorce required him to \u201ctake on a lot of additional debt \nwhen we split up.\u201d (Tr. 22) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nApplicant provided no evidence substantiating that he was getting his finances \nunder control, despite being questioned about these debts almost three years ago during \nan October 2018 Enhanced Subject Interview. Applicant has two delinquent debts that \ntotal more than $33,000. He listed both delinquent obligations when he completed his \nMay 2017 e-QIP. He has provided no documentation that he has contacted either of the \ndebtors or made any payment to them. \n \nApplicant stated he told the credit union that as soon as he had other debts paid \noff, he \u201cwould shift to that one.\u201d However, his intention was to simply let it sit. The debt \nwas not going anywhere and he would \u201cchip away at that when [he] could.\u201d He asserted \nhe had maintained contact with the collection agency, but provided no documentation \nsupporting this allegation.  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nThe record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of \nestablishing that matters in mitigation apply. Five financial considerations mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd.

Dec. 18, 2018) \nApplicant stated he incurred more credit card debt than he could handle. He made \nthe decision to put off paying those debts until he could pay off other debts that he \nconsidered to be priorities. The great majority of his credit history shows good credit. He \nasserts he will pay the two debts. He has 25 years of Army service. He admits making \nbad decisions as far as his debts, but will make every effort to pay them. However, he \nprovided no documentation showing what payment efforts he has made. \nAlthough there are only two delinquent accounts, which makes the behavior \ninfrequent, the debts remain unpaid and therefore cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.

Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThe conditions in AG \u00b6 20(b) are only minimally applicable. Applicant said his \nSeptember 2010 divorce required him to \u201ctake on a lot of additional debt.\u201d However, that \nevent was approximately 11 years ago. He has suffered periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. In April 2012, when he returned from the deployment he was again \nhired by his current employer. Although rehired, he had no job, no desk, no computer, \nand simply an empty cubicle. He was receiving a paycheck and his senior manager told \nhim the company had future plans for him. However, a lack of job satisfaction resulted in \nhis decision to leave the company. He then obtained some full-time and part-time jobs as \na bartender, and had periods of full-time employment with the National Guard. Voluntarily \nleaving a job, even due to lack of job satisfaction, is not an event largely beyond his \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there has been no showing Applicant has \nreceived financial counseling and there are no clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because he has not initiated and \nis not adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is not paying the vehicle repossession debt because he thinks it is unfair. \nHe is upset because he could not voluntarily return the vehicle and owe no additional \namounts on the loan. He has done nothing to address this debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not \napply because, in addition to a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt, there must be documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute, or he must \nprovide evidence of actions to resolve the issue. He has failed to provide any \ndocumentation. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. I considered the whole-person concept factors in \nmy evaluation of the disqualifying and the mitigating conditions of the guidelines, and they \ndo not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nApplicant\u2019s military career with the state Army National Guard is commendable. \nGovernment acknowledges he has been a great citizen with his National Guard service, \nbut stated it was how he handled the two debts, which are relatively large, that poses the \nsecurity concern. It has been almost three years since he was questioned about these \ntwo delinquent debts in October 2019. Since that time there is no track record of payments \nbeing made on either of the debts. His claim that he will contact the collection agency to \narrange an agreement for the credit union debt is too speculative to establish mitigation \nof the two debts. \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid, it is whether \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about his eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nThe decision to deny a clearance at this time should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of true reform and \nrehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance in the future. The \nawarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on \napplying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under \nApplicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not warranted, but should Applicant be \nafforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. Favorable consideration \nshould be given after he meaningfully addresses the two delinquent debts. However, a \nclearance at this time is not warranted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCLAUDE R.

The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nSeptember 1, 2021, and reassigned to me on September 22, 2021. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled on October 25, 2021. On November 8, 2021, I proposed to the \nparties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nDepartment Counsel did not object. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by her divorce, her ex-husband\u2019s \nfailure to pay his share of the marital debt, and her child\u2019s cancer treatment. She started \naddressing her problems in 2016. She paid or settled five debts not alleged in the SOR, \ntotaling about $25,000, well before the SOR was issued. \n1 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines, \nwhich became effective on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe SOR alleges a past-due auto loan; 12 delinquent debts totaling about \n$21,100; and defaulted first and second mortgage loans. The auto loan is now current. \nShe paid, settled, or otherwise resolved 10 of the 12 SOR debts. She contacted the \ncreditors for two of the debts ($829 and $603) about paying or settling the debts. She \nwas told that the debts had been charged off, and the creditors were no longer \ncollecting the debts. \nApplicant and her ex-husband bought a house in 2005 at the height of the \nhousing bubble. The purchase was financed with first (80%) and second (20%) \nmortgage loans. The housing market collapsed, and the house was worth much less \nthan what they paid for it. Applicant\u2019s divorce decree stated that Applicant would live in \nthe house and pay the mortgage loans until their child turned 18 in 2018, at which time \nthe house would be sold, and they would split the profits or losses. \nApplicant negotiated for a short sale of the house. The house was under contract \nfor about six months, when mold was discovered in the hot, empty house after a home \ninspector turned the air conditioning off in the house. The sale was cancelled, and the \nhouse was lost to foreclosure. The creditors for the first mortgage loan issued an IRS \nForm 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) forgiving the deficiency of $88,733. Applicant \nnegotiated with the creditor holding the second mortgage loan to settle the debt for \nabout $31,000. The creditor wants the settlement to be paid over 12 months. She is still \nin negotiations with the creditor to pay the settlement over 24 months. Thus far, she has \nbeen unable to convince her ex-husband to pay his share. She will pay it by herself if \nnecessary. \nApplicant established a plan to resolve her financial problems, and she took \nsignificant action to implement that plan. Based on the record evidence as a whole, I \nconclude that the Government established security concerns under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Those security concerns are mitigated under the \nfollowing mitigating conditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d). \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubt \nabout her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also \ngave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that she \nmet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. This case is \ndecided for Applicant. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n2 \n",

The case was assigned to me on March 3, 2021. \nOn April 9, 2021, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for May 28, 2021, \na date agreed to by the parties. The hearing took place on the scheduled date, though it \noccurred by video-teleconference, rather than in person. The start time of the hearing was \nalso changed.

I overruled the objections \nand AE A was admitted, as set forth in pre-hearing e-mail correspondence marked as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I.

He was terminated in October 2017. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) He was unemployed for \nthe rest of 2017. He then worked on a nine-month contract with defense contractor A for \nmost of 2018. He has worked for his current employer, contractor C, since October 2018. \n(GE 1 at 15-25; Tr. 27) He is a senior mechanical engineer. (Tr. 26) He has never held a \nclearance. (GE 1 at 54; Tr. 8) Applicant has a patent for an invention relating to optic \ntransmission for use in well drilling in the oil industry. (Tr. 29-30, AE F) \nApplicant started drinking in high school. His drinking increased during his first stint \nin college (2002-2008) (Tr. 35-36) When he returned to college in 2010, in his mid-20s, \nhe concentrated on his studies, and stopped partying and drinking. He limited his drinking \nto events like \u201chappy hours\u201d with friends, rather than \u201call-night house parties.\u201d (Tr. 37-38) \nApplicant testified that his drinking increased after college, but was also relatively \ninfrequent. On average, he would consume four drinks per week in social situations with \nfriends, but some weeks he would not drink at all. (Tr. 38-40) He also said he drank \nheavily in his 20s, up to about 2010. (Tr. 90-92) \nIn September 2006, when he was in college in his early 20s, Applicant was \ntailgating at a college football game. He began drinking in the morning, a few hours before \nthe noon kickoff. He was placed into custody, along with others, and charged or cited for \npublic intoxication. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He spent the weekend in jail. He was sentenced to time \nserved. (Tr. 54, 93-95; GE 1 at 46) \nIn May 2007, also while in college, Applicant was out drinking with a group of \nfriends. Applicant was driving. He executed a U-turn without using a turn signal and was \npulled over by police. He was given a sobriety test, and was then arrested and charged \nwith driving while intoxicated (DWI). (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He subsequently pleaded guilty to the \noffense, was convicted, and sentenced to a year of probation. (GE 1 at 47; GE 3) He feels \n\u201cstupid\u201d about what he did. He testified that he went to counseling and learned not to drink \nand drive. If he is out drinking now, he will use a car service or a designated driver. He \nhas not had a DWI arrest since. (Tr. 53-58, 96-102) \n \nOne night in April 2008, Applicant was with his girlfriend in a parked car in a \nrestaurant parking lot. They were engaged in intimate contact. An investigating police \nofficer noticed their activity, and Applicant was charged or cited with public lewdness. (GE \n3) (SOR \u00b6 1.c) Applicant denied that he had been seen driving recklessly beforehand. \nApplicant believes he was targeted because the officer at the scene was the same officer \nwho had arrested him for the May 2007 DWI. (Tr. 58-59, 102-106) Applicant denied that \nhe [or his girlfriend] had been unclothed at any time. He admitted engaging in \u201clewd \nbehavior\u201d at the time, and acknowledged that doing so in public is inappropriate. (Tr. 60) \nThe local district attorney declined to prosecute the case. (AE E; GE 3) \nIn April 2011, Applicant was living with a roommate at the roommate\u2019s mother\u2019s \nhouse. Late one night, while returning from work at about 3:30 a.m., they got into an \naltercation on the street outside the house with two visitors. When Applicant and his \nroommate drove up, they noticed a car parked nearby; its lights were off, but two people \nwere in the car.

Applicant yelled out of the window \nand asked what they were doing. A woman then got out of the car, and ran at the \nApplicant. He put his hand out in a defensive gesture, and she stumbled or fell to the \nground. (Tr. 61 66) Her passenger accused Applicant of hitting the woman. The \npassenger then said something like \u201cI got something to take care of you all,\u201d and walked \nback towards the trunk of his car. (Tr. 60-61, 66; GE 1 at 48-49) \nBelieving the passenger was going to get a weapon, Applicant then went inside \nand came out with a shotgun. (Tr. 62, 66) When he returned outside, the other parties \nwere in the midst of a physical altercation, though that ended when they noticed that \nApplicant was armed. The two visitors then drove away. Applicant and his roommate \ndecided to \u201cremove [themselves] from the situation,\u201d so they stayed elsewhere that night. \n(Tr. 62, 116; AE A at 4) \nA week or so earlier, the roommate\u2019s motorcycle had been tipped over in the \ndriveway. (Tr. 61). The next day, after this incident, the roommate\u2019s motorcycle was tipped \nover again and the garage of the house was also damaged. Applicant believes the visitors \nfrom the previous night had done it. Applicant said the same visitors later came to the \nhouse, in what he believed was an effort to extort money from them over the incident. (Tr. \n63-69, 117) \nThe visitors later filed a police report. Applicant was charged with various offenses, \nincluding assault causing bodily injury, and felony aggravated assault with a deadly \nweapon. (GE 3, AE I, Tr. 106-118) (SOR \u00b6 1.d) Two years later, in 2013. the charges \nwere dismissed after Applicant\u2019s lawyer filed a motion for a speedy trial. (Tr. 70; GE 1 at \n48-49; GE 2 at 2; GE 3) \nApplicant denied that he had pointed his weapon at anyone, and denied that he \nhad hit anyone with the shotgun. He denied that he had been drinking that night. (Tr. 67) \nHe said the visitors were not charged. He called the matter \u201cthe craziest situation I\u2019ve ever \nbeen involved in.\u201d (Tr. 69) \nIn January 2015, Applicant and a friend drove to a nearby large city, about 75 to \n90 minutes away, for an evening out on the town. They initially intended to spend the \nnight, though they did not have a hotel reservation. They spent the evening drinking at \nlocal bars. The friend changed his mind about staying over, and wanted to drive home. \nApplicant protested, knowing the consequences of driving while intoxicated or under the \ninfluence. He knew, however, that he had no way to get home without his friend, short of \nan expensive cab ride. Applicant decided to leave with his friend. (Tr. 71-72, 118-122; GE \n1 at 42-43) \nOn the way home, Applicant\u2019s friend was pulled over for swerving. The friend failed \na roadside sobriety test. They were both taken into custody. Applicant was cited with \npublic intoxication, and he spent the night in a holding cell. (Tr. 72-73, 118-122; GE 1 at \n42-43) (SOR \u00b6 1.e) He later went to court, received deferred adjudication, and the case \nwas dismissed after 30 days.

The work was intense, and involved a six or seven-\nday workweek. Applicant and the other company workers were confined to the hotel or \ntheir work site in the field. One evening, they all had drinks with dinner in the hotel \nrestaurant. Applicant was having relationship troubles with his girlfriend and getting \n\u201cupsetting text messages\u201d from her. He decided to drink in his room to \u201ccure my woes.\u201d \n(Tr. 45-46) He testified that he had four drinks over dinner and four more drinks in his \nroom. (Tr. 125, 138-139) \nAll employees were subject to a breathalyzer each morning when they reported to \nthe work camp, and anytime they left the camp premises. The next morning, Applicant \nregistered a 0.14 blood alcohol content (BAC) level. He was retested a short time later \nand registered a 0.02 BAC. He was sent back to the hotel, and then was flown home to \nthe U.S. and terminated within days. (Tr. 46, 123-127) (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nThis was the first and only time Applicant consumed alcohol during that \nassignment. He knew he was in an environment where safety was paramount. He knew \nemployers were subject to a breathalyzer anytime they checked in at the job site but said \nhe did not know the company had a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy. (Tr. 47, 123-125, 138; GE 2 \nat 4) \nAt his employer\u2019s request Applicant met with a licensed professional counselor \n(LPC) in October 2017, through his employer\u2019s Employee Assistance Program (EAP). \nThe counselor determined that Applicant did not have an \u201calcohol problem,\u201d but that he \ncould benefit from an alcohol class. (Tr. 47-48; GE 2 at 4; AE C) Applicant completed 10 \nhours of substance-abuse education in October-November 2017. (AE G) He testified that \nhe is eligible for rehire. (Tr. 49) \nApplicant testified that he learned in alcohol education about how the rate of \nalcohol intake works (the effect of X number of drinks over Y number of hours, essentially) \nbut also that consuming alcohol to excess affects not just the drinker, but others. He said \nhe no longer drinks during the week. He regrets his decision to drink during the week, \nand will not do so again. He learned not to self-medicate with alcohol. (Tr. 48-50) \nApplicant stated he has not been intoxicated at work or under the influence of alcohol at \nwork since he was terminated in October 2017. (Tr. 51) \nApplicant disclosed the termination on his SCA. He reported that he \u201cdid not realize \nthere would still be alcohol in my system at 7:00 am the next morning. I blew a .04.\u201d (GE \n1 at 19) \nFrom 2015 to late 2018, Applicant was in a long-term relationship. He and his \ngirlfriend, J, lived together for most of 2018 but she did not pay rent. (Tr. 75-76) J had a \nteenage son from a prior marriage, S. (GE 4 at 1) Applicant had a good relationship with \nS and treated him like his own son, Applicant was involved in S\u2019s upbringing.

In November 2018, Applicant notified J that the lease was \nending in December 2018 and that she needed to find a place for her son. (Tr. 77-78) J \nthen notified Applicant that she wanted to assume the lease and move back in to the \napartment when he moved out. This was never formalized. (Tr. 79-80) \nIn early December 2018, Applicant came home one day and found all his \nbelongings in the living room. There was a new lock on the door to Applicant\u2019s bedroom \nthat Applicant believed J had installed. Applicant dismantled the lock and began moving \nhis belongings back in to the bedroom.

(AE A at 7) He was found to be at some risk for future alcohol-related \nincidents, compared to those with no alcohol history. His current alcohol consumption \nwas regarded as clinically acceptable and consistent with public health recommendations. \nHe met no criteria for any mental health condition.

He does not believe that he had an alcohol problem, and he \nexperienced no withdrawal symptoms. He does not feel a desire to order alcohol.

As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(a) \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has six arrests and citations for criminal conduct between September \n2006 and December 2018, including two assault charges and three alcohol-related \narrests. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions for criminal conduct are potentially applicable \nunder AG \u00b6 32:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has six arrests or citations over a twelve-year period. His most recent \narrest involved allegations of assault and battery upon a teenager. Though he denied the \noffense, the police report suggests that the boy was injured. Applicant also has one \nfirearms charge. Applicant\u2019s charges have at times been related to alcohol, but not \nalways. The common link is that Applicant has continued to find himself in problematic \nsituations. This is due, in part, to his own repeated poor judgment. \nApplicant is credited with an excellent work record at his current job, and is an \naccomplished engineer. Weighing against him in this regard is his termination in October \n2017 (considered under mitigation and the whole-person concept, even if the termination \ndoes not itself relate to criminal conduct). \nIn weighing mitigation, I have considered Dr. E\u2019s report, and his conclusions about \nthe likelihood of future alcohol-related issues and criminal conduct on Applicant\u2019s part. \nWhile this evidence is given some weight, the fact remains that Applicant\u2019s history of \ntroubling conduct is both long-term and recent. His actions continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. More time without any criminal conduct, \nalcohol-related or otherwise, is needed to establish that his issues of criminal conduct \nand instances of poor judgment are in his past and unlikely to recur. He has not \nestablished that either mitigating condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) or 32(d) should fully apply. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has three arrests for alcohol-related offenses; in September 2006, May \n2007, and January 2015. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. In October 2017, Applicant had eight drinks \none evening, both at dinner and later in his room, while on a lengthy, intense work \nassignment in a foreign country. This qualifies as an episode of binge drinking, and AG \u00b6 \n22(c) applies. The company had a strict zero-tolerance alcohol policy due to workplace \nsafety concerns. Applicant was found to have alcohol in his system when he was tested \nthe next morning, and he was sent home and terminated. AG \u00b6 22(b) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests are by now quite dated. However, his alcohol \nissues are made much more recent because of his alcohol-related termination in October \n2017, about three and a half years before his late May 2021 hearing. \nApplicant acknowledged his past drinking habits, and the fact that they led to \nproblems with law enforcement. After his termination, he participated in an alcohol \neducation course and counseling through his employer\u2019s EAP program. He does not have \na current alcohol use disorder. He has significantly curtailed his recent drinking to \nclinically acceptable levels, as supported by Dr. E\u2019s report and by Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nHowever, the fact remains that, as with his criminal conduct, Applicant has a long \nand troubled history of security-significant alcohol involvement, made more recent by his \ntermination. He did not provide sufficient evidence that his alcohol-related misconduct is \nunlikely to recur, or that it no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. AG \u00b6 22(b) is also not fully applicable, as he has \nnot demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant has a long history of instances of poor judgment, whether alcohol-related \nor otherwise. They are too numerous and too recent to warrant a finding that they are \nmitigated. The risk of recurrence is too great at this time for him to overcome. He needs \nto establish more of a significant, sustained track record of abstinence or sobriety, as well \nas a track record of compliance with the law before he can be considered a suitable \ncandidate for access to classified information. Applicant did not mitigate the alcohol \ninvolvement or criminal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The DCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it was unable to \nfind it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for her.

On October 23, 2020, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), which included seven documents (Items 1-7) proffered as \nevidence in support of its position that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant, and instructed her that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant received the FORM on November 20, 2020, and she submitted an undated \nresponse that was received by DOHA on January 4, 2021. Her response included her \nproposed revisions to the FORM and a request for a decision with a hearing. In an email to \nDepartment Counsel dated January 25, 2021, Applicant asked that a decision be made \nwithout a hearing so as to avoid any further delays with adjudication of her security \nclearance eligibility. \nOn January 25, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the Government did not \nobject to consideration of the documents Applicant submitted in response to the FORM. On \nFebruary 10, 2021, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on February 19, 2021. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4 in the FORM a summary report of \npersonal subject interviews (PSI) of Applicant conducted on May 23, 2019, and December \n6, 2019, by two different investigators for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as \nwell as a court record concerning a mortgage foreclosure. The summary report was \nincluded in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence and considered \nwith an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules \nof Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In her response to the \nFORM, Applicant objected to consideration of the summary of her interviews, stating that \nthe summary contained \u201csevere inaccuracies;\u201d that the interviews were conducted under \nunsworn declaration; and one of the investigators conducted the interview by cell phone. \nShe did not detail the nature or extent of the reported information claimed to be erroneous, \nbut she requested a re-investigation with reassignment to another OPM investigator. \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFederal Rule of Evidence 901(a) provides that the \u201crequirement of authentication or \nidentification is a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to \nsupport a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d While there is a \nrebuttable presumption that Government officials discharge their duties in good faith (See \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02592 at 4 (Appeal Board Jan. 6, 2021), the Government failed to \nmeet its threshold obligation under the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 to authenticate the summary \nreport. After being placed on notice of Applicant\u2019s objections, the Government could have \ntaken some steps to have the PSI authenticated by the interviewers by affidavit or other \nattestation to their authorship. That portion of Item 4 consisting of the summary report of \nthe PSIs is not accepted into evidence for lack of authentication. The court summary \ndocument included in Item 4 is admissible as a business record under the Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20 and is accepted for my consideration. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s request that she be interviewed by another investigator, the \nadministrative judge does not have the authority to order a new background investigation or \nrule on how security officials conduct investigations. See e.g., 19-01759 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJune 8, 2020). Applicant also asked that updated credit information be obtained because \nItems 5 and 6, credit reports from April 10, 2019, and April 30, 2020, are \u201cold reports.\u201d  \nWhile DOHA officials have the authority to direct further investigation under \u00b6 E3.1.2.1 of \nthe Directive, neither the administrative judge nor Department Counsel has a duty to obtain \nor present mitigating evidence. See ISCR Case No. 19-03376 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2021) (citing ISCR Case No. 19-02819 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020)).

She indicated that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n had \nbeen transferred to the account in SOR \u00b6 1.g, so they are the same debt, and the debt has \nbeen paid off. She explained that she had taken steps to arrange repayment plans or had \nestablished plans in place for other debts. She denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.e, 1.j-1.m, and 1.p-1.x, and stated that she did not recall them. As for the alleged arrests, \nApplicant admitted her arrest for violating her probation in 2015 and explained that she was \nunable to satisfy the community service component because of illness. She denied that \nshe was charged with DUI in February 2014 in that she was instead charged with reckless \ndriving \u2013 reduced from DUI. She also denied a February 2012 battery in that the \u201centire \ncase/charge was dropped.\u201d Regarding the April 2008 incident, Applicant explained that she \nwas not charged with DUI, but rather with reckless driving with alcohol. Applicant admitted \nher DUIs that occurred in November 1999 and February 1993, and explained that she \n\u201clearned valuable lessons from these past mistakes of misdemeanor/charges listed.\u201d (Item \n2.) \nAfter considering the evidence accepted in the record, I make the following findings \nof fact: \n \nApplicant is 50 years old, never been married, and has no children. She has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in information systems, having pursued her college studies on and off \nbetween August 1989 and August 2009. (Item 3.) She paid for her education in part with \nstudent loans. She has worked for a succession of several companies in the information- \ntechnology sector starting in January 1999 but experienced some unemployment from \nMarch 2000 to May 2000, November 2003 to January 2006, and March 2006 to June 2006, \nafter layoffs. She then worked as a systems engineer for a defense contractor from June \n2006 to June 2012, with some brief funding-related periods of unemployment totaling about \na year during that time. Applicant was granted a Secret clearance for her duties in \napproximately June 2006. (Item 3.) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant worked for another defense contractor from June 2012 to May 2013, when \nshe was laid off. Unemployed until October 2014, she fell behind on several financial \nobligations, including on her mortgage loan, which she obtained for $103,976 in July 2007. \nThe loan became approximately $35,000 past due. (Item 3.) The company then holding her \nmortgage foreclosed and sold her residence in October 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.o). (Items 2-5.) \nFrom October 2014 until another layoff in December 2014, Applicant was employed \nas a senior test specialist for a research corporation involved in contract work for the DOD. \nShe began having health issues at that time and for almost the next two years, she was \nself-employed as a systems engineer.

(Item 1.) When she answered the SOR on September 24, 2020, Applicant attributed \nher financial issues to unemployment or lack of income while self-employed and more \nrecently to some health setbacks in December 2016, June 2018, and February 2019 that \ncompromised her income. She denied any unwillingness to address her indebtedness. She \nindicated that she took \u201ca tremendous 60% pay cut\u201d while working for the computer \ncompany from February 2018 to February 2019 (Item 2), but she did not provide any \ndetails about her income or expenses. There is no evidence that she has had any financial \nor budget counseling. The latest credit report in the record is from April 2020. It reflected a \nlack of progress toward addressing several of the debts in the SOR, as set forth in the \nabove table, but also that she was making timely payments of $379 monthly on an \nautomobile loan obtained for $15,654 in February 2018.

The officer searched her \nvehicle, and Applicant recalls that he found \u201can old flask from a \u2018beach day\u2019 a month prior \nwith the smell of alcohol inside, but no liquid.\u201d Court records show that, on January 19, \n2010, she was convicted of reckless driving with alcohol. (Item 2.) She had to complete a \nvictim impact course and a \u201crehab\u201d course for the offense.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant has admitted that she became seriously \ndelinquent on 9 of the 24 accounts listed in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.d, 1.f-1.i, and 1.o-1.p). \nShe indicated that the $8,624 credit-card debt in SOR 1.n was transferred to the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, which charged off a balance of $8,620. However, she presented no \ncorroborating documentation of a debt transfer, and the accounts were separately listed on \nher April 2020 credit report with outstanding balances of $4,066 and $8,624. Both accounts \nhad been charged off, and Applicant did not explain why the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.n would \nreport a past-due balance of $8,624 if the debt had been transferred. Even assuming that \nthey are the same debt, the other admitted delinquencies amply establish security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant denies the alleged medical collection delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, \nand 1.s-1.w; the insurance debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q; the $50 water-utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.r; and \nthe credit-card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.m and 1.x. She presented no documentation to \nsubstantiate her disputes of those debts, which are reported on her credit reports as of \nApril 2019 or April 2020 or both. The Government bears the burden of production on \ncontroverted issues of fact under \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive. The Appeal Board has long \nheld that a credit report can normally be sufficient to meet the Government\u2019s burden of \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproducing substantial evidence of allegations of indebtedness. See e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s denial of the debts on the basis of lack of recall is insufficient to disprove \nher liability for the debts. Regarding the disputed medical debts, the $1,218 medical \ncollection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) first became delinquent in June 2018. Applicant admitted \nhaving medical issues around that time. The other disputed medical debts were placed for \ncollection in December 2014 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s, 1.u, and 1.w) or April 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and 1.v). \nShe had emergency surgery in December 2016 when she lacked income and health \ninsurance. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and 1.v could well be for her care at that time. As for \nthe disputed credit-card debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.m and 1.x), her April 2020 credit report from \nEquifax indicates with respect to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.k and 1.m \u201cConsumer disputes \nafter resolution.\u201d A reasonable inference can be drawn that Applicant unsuccessfully \ndisputed her liability for those debts. \nSeveral of the debts on her April 2019 credit report had been dropped from her \ncredit record as of April 2020. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most \nnegative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency \nor if they become no longer legally collectible because of a state statute of limitations, \nwhich is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. Debts may also be dropped from a credit \nreport upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid or when the \ndebt has been charged off. Even so, debts may still have security significance if they are \nno longer legally collectible or have been dropped from a credit record, particularly if they \nresulted from financially irresponsible behavior or remain unaddressed without reasonable \njustification. Absent any evidence showing that she is not legally liable for any of the debts \nwhich she disputes, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to those SOR debts which she \ndisputes but are listed on one or both of her credit reports, including those accounts which \nhave been charged off or those which no longer appear on her credit report. \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for her financial \njudgment raised by her record of financial delinquency. Application of the aforesaid \ndisqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20. The following may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAvailable credit information for Applicant shows that several of the accounts were \nplaced in collection or charged off five or more years ago (i.e., SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, 1.l, 1.o, \n1.q, 1.s, 1.u, 1.w, and 1.x). Even so, AG \u00b6 20(a), which provides for mitigation of debts that \nhappened \u201cso long ago,\u201d cannot reasonably apply. Only the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g \nhave been fully resolved. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. \n31, 2018) (citing e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially mitigating in that she fell behind on many of the accounts \nbecause of unemployment or underemployment after unexpected layoffs and because of \nhealth issues that compromised her income through lower pay on disability leave, \nuncompensated leave time, or inability to work full-time while recuperating. After being laid \noff in May 2013, she was unemployed until October 2014. She gained employment only to \nbe laid off again in December 2014. She worked only part time while self-employed and \nexperiencing health issues from December 2014 until November 2016. While unemployed \nand then self-employed, she fell seriously behind on her mortgage loan and eventually lost \nher home to foreclosure in October 2015. Only one month into a new job on a DOD \ncontract, she had emergency surgery in December 2016. She suffered another financial \nsetback when she was laid off in September 2017 and unemployed until February 2018. \nAlthough she was gainfully employed from February 2018 to February 2019, health issues \nin June 2018 led her to take uncompensated leave that summer and to eventually resign \nfrom that job. \n \nHowever, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply in mitigation, Applicant has to demonstrate \nthat she acted responsibly under her circumstances to address her delinquent debts once \nshe was in a position to do so. Even giving her six months or so to regain some financial \nstability, she failed to provide sufficient information that could possibly justify her delay in \naddressing her defaulted student loans and her failure to take steps toward resolving other \ndebts. Evidence of debt resolution is limited. She made payments of $1,178.84 on \nDecember 24, 2020, to settle the $1,685 credit-card delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.a; $40 in \nDecember 2020 toward the $1,520 medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b; and $40 each in November \n2020 and December 2020 toward the $308 medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. The $8,620 credit-\ncard delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.g was fully resolved as of July 2020 through wage \ngarnishment. While she entered into a student-loan rehabilitation program in June 2020 for \nher three defaulted student loans totaling $79,819.65, she was apparently unable to \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmaintain the $412 monthly payments because she entered into a new loan rehabilitation \nprogram requiring her to make nine $5 monthly payments starting January 21, 2021. She \nindicated in September 2020 that efforts were in place to address her $1,044 wireless \nphone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but she presented no evidence of any progress on that debt. \nWithout information in the record about Applicant\u2019s income and expenses, it is difficult to \nconclude that she acted fully responsibly within her means to address her financial issues. \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca plan for debt \npayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious \nintent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018), \nciting, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018). There is no evidence \nthat Applicant made any attempt to contact some of her creditors or otherwise take action \ntoward resolving or settling those debts. Ignoring a debt until it drops off one\u2019s credit record \nor it is no longer be legally collectable is not sound financial judgment. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has had any credit counseling, which is required for \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant\u2019s settlement of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, while recent, \nis considered a good-faith effort under AG \u00b6 20(d). Wage garnishment to collect a financial \njudgment (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and resolution through creditor foreclosure (SOR \u00b6 1.o) do not \nqualify for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). That said, because those debts have been \nresolved, they are no longer a source of financial pressure for Applicant. Neither AG \u00b6 \n20(c) nor \u00b6 20(d) apply to the remaining alleged debts. It is unclear how many $412 \npayments Applicant made toward her student loans, which have yet to be rehabilitated. \nShe presented no documentation showing that the debts which she disputes and either are \nstill on her credit report or have been dropped from her credit report are not legitimate \nobligations. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e) requires documented proof. Debts may be \ndropped from a credit record due to the passage of time, the fact that they are no longer \nlegally collectable, or other reason unrelated to payment. While Applicant has made some \nprogress toward addressing her record of serious delinquency, not enough is known about \nher current financial situation, including her income and expenses, to overcome the \nfinancial judgment concerns in this case. The financial considerations security concerns \nhave not been adequately mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s misdemeanor convictions of February 1993 and November \n1999 drunk-driving offenses and of April 2008 and February 2014 alcohol-related reckless \ndriving offenses are incidents that raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b), which provide: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision,  but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe evidence also establishes that Applicant was charged on June 11, 2015, with \nviolating her probation for the February 2014 reckless driving offense. She admits that she \nfailed to complete required community service hours. That offense implicates AGs \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a), 31(b), and 31(d), which provides: \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nWhile a conviction is not required for criminal conduct to raise a security concern, \nthe evidence is insufficient to show that Applicant committed a battery in February 2012. \nApplicant provided little detail about the incident, other than that it was due to a \nmisunderstanding, and the charge was not prosecuted. The criminal conduct AGs provide \nfor mitigation of unproven charges under \u00b6 32(c), \u201cno reliable evidence to support that the \nindividual committed the offense.\u201d \nConditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s DUIs, reckless driving, and probation violation include the following: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s DUI offenses of the 1990s cannot be viewed in isolation from her more \nrecent alcohol-related reckless driving in 2008 and 2014. She exhibited a troubling pattern \nthat reflects adversely on her judgment and reliability. The time span between these \nincidents makes it difficult to mitigate her criminal conduct solely on the basis of the \npassage of time. However, the lack of any recurrence of criminal conduct in the last five \nyears is evidence of some rehabilitation under AG \u00b6 32(d). Her reform is undermined \nsomewhat in that she appeared to minimize the extent to which alcohol was involved in her \nreckless driving. Her description of the February 2014 reckless driving on her SCA \u2013 it \ninvolved driving too slowly and crossing into the bike lane \u2013 gave no indication that alcohol \nwas involved. She refused to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test for alcohol and was \ninitially charged with DUI. However, she no longer consumes any alcohol, and has an \nexcellent employment record with her current employer. In 2020, she exceeded her \nmanager\u2019s expectations and showed herself to be a self-directed systems software \n16 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nengineer expert. Her dedication to her work and positive change in her circumstances are \nsignificant deterrents to any future criminal conduct. The criminal conduct security \nconcerns are adequately mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security clearance eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines \nF and J are incorporated in my whole-person analysis, but some additional comment is \nwarranted. \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to her fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). It was \nincumbent on Applicant to show that her financial situation is sufficiently stable and not \nlikely to present an ongoing security concern. There is evidence of delinquent medical bills \nin recent years. While she has begun repaying some of the debts, she has not made \nsufficient progress to fully allay the financial considerations security concerns. Her timely \npayments on a February 2018 car loan weigh in her favor, but too many unanswered \nquestions exist about her financial situation. \n \nRegarding the criminal conduct security concerns, the Government expressed \nconcern in the FORM about Applicant\u2019s failure to accurately report her arrest record on her \nMarch 2019 SCA. In the whole-person assessment, it casts some doubt as to whether \nApplicant can be counted on to abide by her obligations, including whether she can be \ncounted on to fulfill her commitments to repay her delinquent debts. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009), \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \n(citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 49, has worked for a federal contracting company since November 2019. He was initially granted access to classified information in 1991, in connection with his military service, and was granted special program access in approximately 2004. Applicant completed his most recent security clearance application in August 2019. He did not disclose any derogatory information. The background investigation developed information that Applicant owed over $63,000 on four charged-off auto loans, which are alleged in the SOR as \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. (Tr. 116, 122; GE 1, GE 2) Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1991 to 2017, when he retired as an E-7. Between 1999 and 2017, he served as the crew chief of a special operations aviation regiment. Due to the nature of his job, Applicant was on a continuous alert cycle or continuous rotation cycle for 16 years. He spent approximately 280 days, or 78% of each year on deployments. According to Applicant, his successful Army career would not have been possible without his wife of 23 years, who took care of their home and family. She was responsible for their family finances, including the household budget and filing of their tax returns. She also held a power of attorney empowering her to act on Applicant\u2019s behalf.

The alleged SOR debts are not \nthe product of irresponsible financial behavior, but a failed business venture by \nApplicant\u2019s wife. Neither the origination of these debts nor Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve \nthem make him vulnerable to coercion or exploitation. Furthermore, these debts do not \notherwise raise doubts about his ongoing security worthiness. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 28, 2020, the DOD issued an SOR detailing security concerns under \nthe financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines. This action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed \nby President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, 2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \na determination whether to revoke his security clearance.

I granted the motion without objection from Applicant. (Tr. 11- \n12). \nEvidentiary Matters \nDepartment Counsel objected to the admission of AE T as irrelevant. (Tr. 28-29; \nHE III) The exhibit is a series of documents related to a number of state and federal court \ncases against Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law related to her failure to pay state and federal \nincome taxes. The documents are public records and are admitted for the limited purpose \nof substantiating Applicant\u2019s claims that his sister-in-law acted in bad-faith when engaged \nin a business venture with his wife. Department Counsel\u2019s objection is overruled. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 49, has worked for a federal contracting company since November \n2019. He was initially granted access to classified information in 1991, in connection with \nhis military service, and was granted special program access in approximately 2004. \nApplicant completed his most recent security clearance application in August 2019. He \ndid not disclose any derogatory information. The background investigation developed \ninformation that Applicant owed over $63,000 on four charged-off auto loans, which are \nalleged in the SOR as \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. (Tr. 116, 122; GE 1, GE 2) \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1991 to 2017, when he \nretired as an E-7. Between 1999 and 2017, he served as the crew chief of a special \noperations aviation regiment. Due to the nature of his job, Applicant was on a continuous \nalert cycle or continuous rotation cycle for 16 years. He spent approximately 280 days, or \n78% of each year on deployments. According to Applicant, his successful Army career \nwould not have been possible without his wife of 23 years, who took care of their home \nand family. She was responsible for their family finances, including the household budget \nand filing of their tax returns. She also held a power of attorney empowering her to act on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf. During his brief time at home, Applicant focused on spending time with \nthe couple\u2019s daughter, and not the family\u2019s financial issues. Applicant explained that he \ntrusted his wife implicitly to handle their affairs.

Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is eight years older than his wife. She viewed \nher sister as another mother figure and trusted her. Between Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nemployment in commercial real estate property management and her sister\u2019s experience \noperating a small business, Applicant\u2019s wife believed they could run a successful \nbusiness. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was responsible for the business operations and \naccounting. Applicant\u2019s wife assumed the role of financing the business, and invested the \nsalary from her full-time job as a commercial property manager into the company. She \nalso personally purchased three vehicles and transferred one of the couple\u2019s personal \nvehicles to the business to provide transportation to staff. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d) The bank \noriginated the vehicle loans with Applicant and his wife as co-debtors; however, \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that Applicant did not sign any of the loan origination documents. \nApplicant recalls that his wife discussed the business idea with him. He did not have \nanything to do with the business operations and was deployed while the business was in \noperation. (Tr. 38-40, 45, 48, 77, 87-89, 107-110,127; AE J-M, P) \nIn April 2013, Applicant\u2019s wife learned that her sister failed to pay the state \nbusiness taxes. She then began to suspect that her sister was not properly managing the \nbusiness. Shortly, thereafter, Applicant\u2019s wife learned that her sister was taking money \nfrom the business. Applicant\u2019s wife asked her sister if she could review the business\u2019s \naccounting records. Her sister objected. The two women argued, resulting in her sister \nabandoning the enterprise. In retaliation, Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law made a complaint to \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s employer, a commercial property management company, resulting in \nher termination. Applicant\u2019s wife has been unemployed since then. Despite her efforts to \nkeep the business going, the business ceased operations in 2014. Applicant learned of \nthe business failure and his wife\u2019s problems with her sister during one of his stints at \nhome. He inquired as to whether she required his help to resolve any lingering issues \nrelated to the business. After assuring him that she did not require his help, Applicant did \nnot intervene further into the matter. (Tr. 45-46, 48, 78-81, 109, 127-128; AE N-O, Q-R) \nApplicant continued his rigorous deployment schedule, assuming that his wife \nresolved all the issues related to the failed business. It was not until 2015, during a \nbackground interview he completed in connection with a periodic reinvestigation, did he \nlearn otherwise. After the interview, he confronted his wife about the accounts. She \nassured him that she was working to resolve the issues. Applicant authorized his wife to \nuse $7,000 from his thrift savings plan to resolve the business debts. He deployed again, \nbelieving that his wife had the issue under control. Applicant began his current job in \nNovember 2019, supporting his former military unit. When he completed his most recent \nsecurity clearance application in August 2019, he was under the impression that he wife \nwas making payments on the auto loans. He continued to hold that belief when he \ncompleted his November 2020 answer to the SOR. (Tr. 41, 130, 139-141, 143; GE 2; AE \nS) \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife explained that she paid the accounts sporadically \nbetween 2013 and April 2018, when she stopped making payments altogether because \nof their limited income. Between 2017 and 2019, both Applicant and his wife were \nunemployed. The family lived off of Applicant\u2019s retirement pay and disability benefits.

They pay the costs upfront \nand are reimbursed by their insurance provider within 60 to 90 days of their filing a claim.  \nShe also explained that the ability to repay the loans was also affected by the transitional \nnature of their lives between 2017 and 2019. The couple did not have a permanent home, \nliving with different family members over the course of those two years as they tried to \nfind a home. The couple lived with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother from 2018 to 2019, when he \ndied by suicide in a fire that consumed his home, which also contained some of \nApplicant\u2019s family\u2019s possessions and personal documents. (Tr. 55-59, 60, 62, 110, 112-\n113, 147, 167, 169; AE S, Y-Z)  \nIn late 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife contacted the original creditor servicing the four auto \nloans to resume payments, but learned the debt had been sold to a collection agency. In \n2019, she received a settlement offer from the collection agency, but that agency sold the \ndebt to another company before she could start making payments. In March 2021, the \nnew creditor contacted Applicant\u2019s wife. They negotiated a settlement amount and \nestablished a payment plan of $800 each month to begin in April 2021. After making two \npayments, the creditor sold the account to the current collection agency. Applicant\u2019s wife \ncontinued to make payments to the current creditor under the terms she negotiated with \nthe previous collection agency. The current creditor did not immediately acknowledge the \nagreement, but accepted the payments. In June 2021, the current creditor agreed to settle \nthe accounts for $39,581. Under the terms of the agreement, Applicant must make two \npayments, an initial payment of $800 and another lump sum payment of $37,181. The \ncouple plans to take advantage of the offer, using proceeds from the reimbursements of \ntheir medical expenses and federal income tax refunds, and if necessary their $10,000 \nsavings. (Tr.60, 63-65, 67-71, 99-106,143; AE C, V-U, X) \nApplicant\u2019s wife still maintains primary responsibilities for managing the couple\u2019s \nfinances. However, the couple operates in a more collaborative manner. They completed \na financial counseling class through their church and have developed a household \nbudget. The couple is financially stable. They have established a permanent residence \nand purchased a home in which they have approximately $63,000 in equity to use toward \nthe resolution of their debt. Applicant currently earns $110,000 annually in addition to his \n$12,000 in combined retirement and disability income. The couple lives within their means \nand does not have a history of other financial problems. Aside from the four auto \naccounts, the couple does not have any other delinquent accounts. Applicant has a \nfavorable credit history with all but the four accounts alleged in the SOR being reported \nas \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d (Tr. 132, 136, 153, 173; GE 3- GE 4; AE C, F) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). Here, the SOR alleges with four delinquent automobile \nloan accounts, totaling $63,146, as a co-debtor with his wife. The Government has \nestablished its prima facie case, and the following financial considerations disqualifying \ncondition applies: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOutside of these four business-related debts, Applicant does not have a history of \nfinancial problems. The origination of these business debts are not indicative of \nirresponsible or reckless financial behavior. Nor do these loans indicate any behavior that \ncalls into question Applicant\u2019s ability to handle or protect classified information. The debts \nin this case arise from Applicant\u2019s wife, who acting in good-faith, entered into an ill-fated \nbusiness partnership with a close family member who proved dishonest. Upon learning \nof the delinquent debts in 2015, Applicant attempted to resolve the debts by giving his \nwife permission to use his retirement savings to resolve them. He credibly believed that \nhis wife continued to work towards the resolution of these debts, which she did until the \ncouple\u2019s finances, strained by two years of unemployment, limited income, and recurring \nmedical expenses, prevented her from doing so.  However, since Applicant returned to \nfull-time employment, they have taken steps to resolve the delinquent accounts, following \nthe accounts from creditor to creditor to negotiate a payment arrangement. In an effort to \nimprove their financial habits, the couple also completed a financial counseling class. \nAside from these four accounts, Applicant\u2019s finances appear to under their control. Based \non the record, the following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts. \n AG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior \u2026occurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practice, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG 20 (d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nBased on the record, no doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). The fact that the four accounts were not resolved by the time \nthe record closed in this case is not outcome determinative.

He has worked primarily as a federal contractor and held a security clearance from 1997 until at least 2016. (GX 3; GX 4; AX A.)

On \nDecember 7, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 18, 2020, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing.

The DOHA \ntransmittal letter and receipt are appended to the record as Administrative Exhibit (Admin. \nEx.) 1. The case was assigned to me on May 4, 2021. \nAfter receiving a copy of my decision, Applicant appealed and filed a supporting \nbrief. In his brief, Applicant stated that he did not file a response to the FORM because \nhe was diagnosed with a serious illness during the 30-day period in which he was \npermitted to respond, and provided a supporting document from a doctor. Based on this \nevidence, the DOHA Appeal Board determined that the new evidence raised due process \nconcerns. The record does not contain a copy of the supporting document from the doctor. \nOn August 11, 2021, I received an order from the DOHA Appeal Board remanding \nthe case and requiring me to reopen the record to permit Applicant an opportunity to \nsubmit additional evidence. On August 31, 2021, I notified Applicant and Department \nCounsel of the remand and attached an order in which I reopened the record until \nSeptember 17, 2021. (Admin. EX 2.) Applicant timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) \nA through F, to which the Government had no objections. \nIn its order, the DOHA Appeal Board also noted that Applicant contends that I erred \nin my finding of facts about the dates of his unemployment and the dates when the four \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d went into collection. These two issues are \naddressed in my Findings of Facts, below. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 50, is a network administrator working for a defense contractor since \nJuly 2019. He graduated from high school in 1989 and then briefly attended a community \ncollege. He married in 2004 and he and his wife have four children. He has worked \nprimarily as a federal contractor and held a security clearance from 1997 until at least \n2016. (GX 3; GX 4; AX A.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted on six delinquent \ncredit-card accounts totaling $46,309. Applicant admitted each of these allegations in his \nanswer to the SOR and provided an explanation for the debts. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nIn my original decision, I erred in the following findings of fact: \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d totaling $25,533 went into \ncollection in or before March 2017, prior to when Applicant began \nconstruction of his house and prior to his car accident. (GX 5.) \nIn reviewing the August 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) (GX 5), I found the SOR \ndebts alleged under the \u201cCollections Section\u201d beginning on page 10.

However, in \ncross-referencing the April 2020 CBR (GX 6), these dates correlated to the dates that the \naccounts were opened, not the dates assigned to collections. \nAccording to the April 2020 CBR (GX 6), the most recent record evidence \nregarding the status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts, the dates of the first noted \ndelinquencies on Applicant\u2019s credit-card debts are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a - $3,117: March 2018; \nSOR \u00b6 1.b - $3,156: April 2018; \nSOR \u00b6 1.c - $14,405: June 2018; \nSOR \u00b6 1.d - $4,855: March 2018; \nSOR \u00b6 1.e - $5,674: May 2018; and \nSOR \u00b6 1.f - $15,102: June 2018. \nThe $5,674 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and the $15,102 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) have accumulated \n$1,726 in interest bringing the total of the two delinquent debts to $21,692 and the total \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt to $48,035 as of April 2020. \nIn responding to the questions on his e-QIP under Section 26 - Financial \nConsiderations, Applicant listed SOR debts 1.e and 1.f under \u201cDelinquencies Involving \nEnforcement.\u201d He listed the reason for the financial issue as \u201cMedical (car accident), \nshort-term disability, Family Medical Leave Act.\u201d He explained that he had been \nunemployed since February 2019 and had no current means to pay the debts. He \nasserted that he would pay off the debts from the proceeds of the sale of his house, \nstating that he would have enough money to \u201csettle all debt.\u201d Applicant listed SOR debts \n1.b through 1.d as delinquent routine accounts. In response to the query of what action \nhe had taken to resolve the debts or an explanation for why he had not, he entered \n\u201cproperty sale\u201d for two of the debts and \u201chouse sale\u201d for the third. (GX 3.)  \n \n \n \n \n \nOn September 5, 2019, Applicant underwent a personal subject interview (PSI). In \ndiscussing each of his delinquent credit-card debts with the investigator, Applicant stated \nthat the circumstances that led to the delinquency of all of his credit-card accounts were \nthat he was in a car accident on June 1, 2018, and out of work under the Family Medical \nLeave Act and receiving short-term disability which was less than his regular income. He \nstated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.f became delinquent in July 2018. \nHowever, he stated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c became delinquent in \nMay 2018 but did not offer an additional explanation for why these accounts were \ndelinquent prior to the car accident. He further stated that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nbecame delinquent in June 2018. Applicant stated that the debts were unresolved and he \nhad not made any arrangements for their resolution. He asserted that he was selling his \nhouse on September 24, 2019, and planned to pay all his outstanding debts with the \nproceeds from the sale.

He stated that he had qualified as a homeowner/builder to construct \na house in another state. Applicant asserted that his credit was in good standing at that \ntime and that he had budgeted for all construction expenses. He was approved for a \nconstruction loan, moved himself and his family, and broke ground on the house in the \nwinter of 2017. However, the 2017 date was inaccurate. Applicant\u2019s response to the \nFORM included a detailed timeline (AX A) submitted when I reopened the record. In the \ntimeline, Applicant states that he broke ground on his home in December 2016 and had \none year to complete the custom-home build in accordance with the loan agreement. On \nhis e-QIP, he listed January 2018 as his first date of residency in the house. Based on \nthe totality of the record evidence, Applicant began construction on his house in \nDecember 2016, not 2017. \nIn November 2017, despite his budgeting, Applicant contacted the lending bank to \nrequest an additional $40,000 be added to the original construction loan to cover \nconstruction-cost overruns. According to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, the lending bank \ndenied this request but advised him to use his credit cards to pay the cost overruns and \nto then apply for a home-equity line-of-credit (HELOC) to pay off the credit-card debt. \nApplicant used his credit cards for the construction costs, but was denied a HELOC \nbecause his credit score was too low. (AX A.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated \nthat, \u201cthis is the only reason I have the credit-card debt, it was all construction materials.\u201d \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that the lending bank informed him \nthat it could not add to the loan but that once the loan was closed, the bank could \u201ceasily \noffer [him] a HELOC to pay off the credit cards at a much lower interest rate\u201d than the \nexisting loan. He further stated that the bank \u201cencouraged\u201d him to use his credit cards to \npay the cost overruns to complete the construction. Applicant stated that in February \n2018, the bank denied his HELOC due to his extensive credit-card debt. He further stated \nthat following the bank\u2019s advice put him in a \u201cterrible position.\u201d \nAs a result, in February 2018 Applicant started immediately working with a law firm \nto settle his debts. According to Applicant, the law firm advised him to close all his credit-\ncard accounts, stop making payments on the accounts, and work through the law firm to \nresolve the debts. (AX A.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated \u201cWe have an \nattorney and have a workout plan for repayment with banking institutions for [the] \nunforeseen credit-card debt.\u201d The contract with the law firm states that the law firm will \nattempt to settle the debts for less than 50% of the balances owed. The law firm charged \na monthly fee, not shown in the portion of the document provided by Applicant, as well as \na percentage fee based on the difference between the balance owed and the amount \npaid to the creditor. The law firm stated that it was therefore motivated to settle the \naccounts for the least amount of money giving the law firm a higher payout. The contract \ngives the following example: \u201cYour debt balance is $15,000 and is settled for $8,000 \nsaving you $7,000, 20% of which, or $1,400, is paid to the [law firm] leaving your total \ncost at $9,400.\u201d The contract further states that debts with balances below $10,000 will \nbe charged a 30% fee upon settlement.

In January 2019, Applicant was told by a friend that \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance was \u201cin a state of inactivity,\u201d and that the friend had a \nproject at his company that Applicant could work on. Applicant quit his job, listed the \nhouse for sale, and moved back to his previous state of residence. On February 24, 2019, \nApplicant submitted an e-QIP, apparently with the expectation of reactivating his security \nclearance. However, he subsequently learned that his clearance was \u201cconsidered \narchived\u201d and that he would need to undergo a new investigation. Applicant states that \nthis required him to find a sponsor which did not occur until May 2019. However, that \nemployment was contingent upon Applicant\u2019s ability to hold a security clearance. In July \n2019, he accepted a job offer in a third state, where he moved to an extended-stay hotel \nin August 2019. (AX A.) \nOn September 24, 2019, Applicant finalized the sale of his house. He was offered \na different position and in October 2019, he moved his family to his current state of \nresidence. He stated that at that time he was steadily employed and had the equity from \nthe sale of his house. He decided to fire the law firm that he had hired in February 2018 \nbecause it had done \u201cnothing in a year\u2019s time to help us with our debt consolidation.\u201d He \nstarted looking for another lawyer to hire to address his debt. \nIn November 2019, he hired a credit-repair company with whom he had briefly met \nin August 2019. (AX A.) The November 30, 2019, invoice provided by Applicant shows \nthe amount owed to the credit-repair company as $7,000 with a balance due of $0.00. \nThe contract states that the payment schedule is to be determined, that the purposes of \nthe services provided by the credit-repair company are credit enhancement and the \nremoval of negative items, and that the estimated time for \u201crepair\u201d is 30 to 60 days. (AX \nB.) In March 2021, three months after the SOR was issued, Applicant fired this credit-\nrepair company because it had not done anything to resolve Applicant\u2019s debts. (AX A.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributes his ongoing financial difficulties to \nhis periods of unemployment. Applicant listed his dates of unemployment on his e-QIP as\nFebruary 2019 until June 2019, and confirmed this during his PSI. In his December 2020 \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that he was currently unemployed as a result of the COVID-\n19 pandemic but did not give a date when the unemployment began.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG.

An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nInitially, on his July 2019 e-QIP and during his September 2019, Applicant stated \nthat his inability to meet his financial obligations originated in June 2018 following a car \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccident that resulted in his inability to work and his decreased income from short-term \ndisability.

However, on \nhis e-QIP, he stated that he would resolve all his debts with the proceeds from the sale \nof his house. During his PSI, he reiterated this assertion and gave the date of the sale as \nSeptember 24, 2019. \nApplicant did not tell the investigator that the origin of his delinquent credit-card \ndebt was construction-cost overruns for the house he was selling. He did not state that \nhe had hired a law firm in February 2018 that would attempt to settle his debts for less \nthan 50% of the balances Applicant owed. He did not disclose that he had voluntarily \nclosed the credit-card accounts and stopped making payments on them in February 2018. \nThe only reference made to the home in both the PSI and the e-QIP was that Applicant \nwould pay all of his delinquent accounts with the proceeds from its sale. \nApplicant did in fact finalize the sale of his house on September 24, 2019. \nHowever, he did not pay his delinquent credit-card debts from the proceeds. He did not \npay even one of the accounts. He did not offer any explanation, or even make any \nreference to the proceeds of the sale in his answer to the SOR. The only reference he \nmade in his response to the FORM was that in October 2019 he had a \u201csteady job, and \nthe equity from our home\u201d and he had to fire the law firm he hired in 2018 and look for a \nnew one. \nGood faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, \nand adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of \ndebts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. The appeal board has \nregularly held that \u201capplicants who only begin to address their security-significant conduct \nwhen their personal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017.) \nApplicant\u2019s first effort to resolve his credit-card debts was to hire a law firm that \nwould offer less than 50% of what Applicant owed. He immediately benefitted from this \narrangement because in February 2018 he stopped making payments on the more than \n$40,000 that he owed. Applicant claims that all of the debt he accrued on these credit \ncards was for the construction-cost overruns in completing the house he constructed. He \nrealized the return on his investment in the cost overruns when he sold his house for a \nprofit in September 2019. Yet he did not make good with his creditors. Instead, in \nNovember 2019, he hired a credit-repair company to assist him in settling his debts for \nless than what he owed. \nHowever, according to Applicant, it was not until March 2021, three months after \nhe received the SOR, that he began paying the $3,156 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, and not until May 2021 that it was paid off, although there is no documentary evidence \nsupporting the payment. He states that he is negotiating with the creditor of the $3,117 \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He has not made any payments on any of the other debts. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nHowever, he paid a monthly fee to the law firm and $7,000 to the credit-repair company \nin an effort to not have to fully pay the debts he incurred while completing construction of \na house he later sold for a profit. Even excluding the one debt that Applicant has allegedly \npaid, as of April 2020, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt totals $44,879. \nI have considered the potential mitigating conditions in light of the negative impact \nthat Applicant\u2019s car accident, periods of unemployment, archiving of his security \nclearance, and the COVID-19 pandemic has had on his overall financial circumstances. I \nhave also considered Applicant\u2019s assertions that he and his family have changed their \napproach to finances and budgeting and have adopted a lifestyle of living within their \nmeans. While he did not specifically state this, I can reasonably infer that Applicant used \nthe proceeds from the sale of his house for living expenses while he was unemployed. \nHowever, the actual origin of Applicant\u2019s financial issues arose when he became \noverextended in a speculative real estate investment. While he hired two separate entities \nin an effort to settle his debts, no substantive action was taken to resolve the debts \nbetween 2018 and March 2021. When he sold his house in September 2019, he \nfinancially benefitted from the credit extended to him. Yet not only did he did not pay all \nof his creditors from the proceeds as he asserted that he would, he did not pay even a \nsingle one.  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and ongoing and were incurred under \ncircumstances that cast doubt on his current reliability and judgment. Applicant became \nfinancially overextended on a speculative investment. While conditions largely beyond his \ncontrol had an adverse impact on his ongoing financial issues, he has not acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not made a good-faith effort to repay or \notherwise resolve his delinquent debts. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant was first granted a security clearance in 1997. However, his recent and \nongoing failure to honor his financial obligations by resolving his delinquent debts leaves \nme with doubts about his security worthiness. He did not resolve any of his debts until \nfive months after the SOR was issued and remains indebted for over $44,000. He had \nthe opportunity to resolve his delinquent accounts upon the sale of his house in \nSeptember 2019, but failed to do so. \nSecurity clearance adjudications are not meant to be punitive but rather are to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s current ability to properly handle and protect classified \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Ultimately, the record shows that Applicant has failed to demonstrate the \ngood judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of those granted access to \nclassified information. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his significant delinquent debt. Accordingly, \nI conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old technical data manager and training coordinator employed by a defense contractor since January 2018. He attended a technical college from March 2015 to May 2016 but did not receive a degree. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from May 1992 to February 2008 and received an honorable discharge. 2 Applicant married in January 1995, divorced in May 1997, remarried in September 1997, and divorced in August 2009. He married his current spouse in January 2010. He has two children from previous marriages, ages 22 and 20, and a five-year-old child from his current marriage. Applicant received a security clearance in May 1992, which was revoked in June 2007 for financial reasons. When his clearance was revoked, he was given a choice of cross-rating to another specialty that did not require a clearance or being discharged. He chose to be discharged. (GX 4 at 2.) His clearance was later reinstated on a date not reflected in the record.

Price, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/24/2021 \nDecision \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves trustworthiness concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsideration) and B (Foreign Influence). Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, but he has not mitigated the concerns under Guideline F. Eligibility for \nassignment to a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 23, 2018, seeking eligibility for a public trust position. On June 10, 2019, \nthe Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns under \nGuidelines B and F. The CAF acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for \nall adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 25, 2020, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing before an administrative judge. Department \nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on November 30, 2020.

He received the FORM on January 13, 2021, and \nhe did not respond. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 2021. \nThe FORM included Item 4, a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) \nconducted by a security investigator on November 13, 2018. The PSI summary was not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant \nthat he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary \non the ground that it was not authenticated. I conclude that Applicant waived any \nobjections to the PSI summary by failing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Ethiopia (Hearing Exhibit I). I have granted the request in part. One paragraph of \nthe request for administrative notice is based on a document from the Congressional \nResearch Service (CRS), attached to the request for administrative notice and referenced \nin footnote 9. Reports prepared by CRS do not necessarily contain statements of fact that \nare not subject to reasonable dispute, nor do they necessarily represent the official \npositions of the U.S. Government. \nThe disclaimer at the end of the CRS document proffered by Department Counsel \nincludes the following: \nThis document was prepared by the Congressional Research Service \n(CRS). CRS serves as nonpartisan shared staff to congressional committees \nand Members of Congress. It operates solely at the behest of and under the \ndirection of Congress. Information in a CRS Report should not be relied \nupon for purposes other than public understanding of information that \nhas been provided by CRS to Members of Congress in connection with \nCRS\u2019s institutional role. . . . (Emphasis added.) \nBased on the limited purposes for which CRS reports are published, I have not taken \nadministrative notice of the facts recited in the CRS document. \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant is a 49-year-old technical data manager and training coordinator \nemployed by a defense contractor since January 2018. He attended a technical college \nfrom March 2015 to May 2016 but did not receive a degree. He served on active duty in \nthe U.S. Navy from May 1992 to February 2008 and received an honorable discharge. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant married in January 1995, divorced in May 1997, remarried in September \n1997, and divorced in August 2009. He married his current spouse in January 2010. He \nhas two children from previous marriages, ages 22 and 20, and a five-year-old child from \nhis current marriage. \nApplicant received a security clearance in May 1992, which was revoked in June \n2007 for financial reasons. When his clearance was revoked, he was given a choice of \ncross-rating to another specialty that did not require a clearance or being discharged. He \nchose to be discharged. (GX 4 at 2.) His clearance was later reinstated on a date not \nreflected in the record. He was unemployed for about two months after his discharge and \nfor short periods between jobs, from September to November 2008, March to May 2010, \nFebruary to April 2012, and January to February 2015. He was laid off in December 2015 \nbecause his application to continue his clearance was denied. He was unemployed from \nDecember 2015 to May 2016. \nWhile Applicant was unemployed, he surrendered the vehicle and incurred the \ndeficiency alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He was evicted from his apartment and lived in his car \nfor three months. He sent his wife to live with her parents in Ethiopia. He fell behind on \nhis utility and cellphone payments and was unable to make his child-support payments. \nApplicant worked for a state government from May 2016 to June 2016 and was a \nfederal employee from July to November 2016. He worked for a defense contractor from \nJanuary 2016 until January 2018, when he began working for his current employer. He \nsatisfied the arrearage on his child-support payments in June 2017. (GX 4 at 6.) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $47,109. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he attributed the delinquent debts to his unemployment for nine \nmonths, from February to December 2015. The evidence concerning these debts is \nsummarized below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: deficiency of $14,285 after repossession of a vehicle. This account \nwas opened in July 2015. Applicant surrendered the vehicle in April 2016 because he \ncould not make the payments. (GX 6 at 3.) He submitted no evidence of payments, \npayment agreements, or other resolution of this debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent auto loan placed for collection of $7,599. In the \nNovember 2018 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he stopped making payments on \nthis auto loan because he was being assigned overseas and had no need for the vehicle. \n(GX 4 at 9.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that this loan became delinquent when \nhe was laid off in December 2015. The credit reports from May 2018 and November 2019 \nreflect that the last activity on this debt was in December 2016 and that it was referred for \ncollection in December 2017, after he was hired by a defense contractor. (GX 5 at 2; GX \n6 at 3.) He submitted no evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other resolution \nof this debt. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: cellphone bill placed for collection of $1,777. This debt was placed \nfor collection in April 2017. In the PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he did not intend \nto pay this debt because he was informed that it would remain on his credit report even if \nhe paid it. (GX 4 at 7.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: utility bill placed for collection of $374. This debt was placed for \ncollection in March 2016. (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant submitted no evidence of payments, \npayment agreements, or other resolution of this debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: deficiency of $18,784 after repossession of a vehicle. This account \nwas opened in July 2015 and charged off in June 2016. (GX 6 at 3.) Applicant submitted \nno evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other resolution of this debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: delinquent rent placed for collection of $3,139. The debt was placed \nfor collection in November 2017. (GX 6 at 7.) In the PSI, Applicant told an investigator \nthat he incurred this debt when he broke his lease on an apartment to move to a new job. \nHe also told the investigator that he did not intend to pay this debt because he was \ninformed that it would remain on his credit report even if he paid it. (GX 4 at 8.) In his \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that this was incurred when he was laid off, could not pay \nhis rent, and was evicted. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: medical bill placed for collection of $587.Placed for collection in \nDecember 2017. In the PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he did not intend to pay \nthis debt because he was informed that it would remain on his credit report even if he paid \nit. (GX 4 at 8.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: cellphone bill placed for collection of $564. This account was \nplaced for collection in May 2017. In the November 2018 PSI, Applicant told an \ninvestigator that the debt arose when he switched cellphone providers and the new \nprovider did not honor its promise to pay off the previous provider. He told the investigator \nthat he did not intend to pay this debt. (GX 4 at 8.) The credit report from May 2018 \nreflected that the debt was disputed. (GX 6 at 7.) The debt is not reflected in the credit \nreports from November 2019 and October 2020. (GX 5; GX 7.) \nApplicant provided no information about his current income and expenses. In the \nPSI, he told the investigator that he had never received financial counseling or used any \ndebt-consolidation services. (GX 4 at 9.) \nForeign Influence \nApplicant\u2019s 36-year-old wife is a citizen of Ethiopia and is a permanent resident of \nthe United States. They married in January 2010, in Qatar, while Applicant was working \nfor a defense contractor in that country.  Her green card expires in July 2025. At the time \nof the PSI, she was a student, not otherwise employed, and had no connections to a \nforeign government, military or security services, defense industry, foreign movements, \nor intelligence service. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Ethiopia. \nHis father-in-law is employed by a commercial bank in Ethiopia. His mother-in-law was \nemployed by the Ethiopian National Intelligence and Security Service as a secretary until \nshe retired recently. (GX 4 at 3.) The record does not reflect her duties as a secretary \nwith any specificity and does not reflect when she retired. Applicant has limited \ncommunication with his mother-in-law because her ability to speak and understand \nEnglish is limited. He provided no information about his contact, if any, with his father-in-\nlaw. \nI have taken administrative notice that Ethiopia is a federal republic with a generally \nstable government. The United States first established diplomatic relations with Ethiopia \nin 1903. The current form of government was established in May 1991, when a coalition \nof guerilla groups ended 17 years of a Marxist military dictatorship and established a \nfederally organized state with regions based on the ethnicity of the population. The \nideology of the government was \u201cdevelopmental democracy,\u201d which prioritized economic \ndevelopment over political rights. \nIn April 2018, a new prime minister released thousands of prisoners, allowed exiled \ndissidents to return, unblocked hundreds of media outlets, enabled the formation and \nunfettered operation of new political parties, and undertook revisions of repressive laws. \nDespite these reforms, ethnic tensions remained. Ethnic violence arose in November \n2020, including mass killings of ethnic and religious groups by nonstate actors, causing \nthe U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa to issue a security alert, warning of military action and \nheightened instability throughout the country. The U.S. Department of State has issued a \nLevel 3 travel advisory (\u201dreconsider travel\u201d) and has assessed Addis Ababa as a medium-\nthreat location for terrorism directed at or affecting U.S. government interests. \nThe U.S. diplomatic relationship with Ethiopia is focused on four broad goals: (1) \nprotecting U.S. citizens, (2) strengthening democratic institutions and expanding human \nrights, (3) spurring broad-based economic grown and promoting development; and (4) \nadvancing regional peace and security. The United States is the largest bilateral \ncontributor to humanitarian needs in Ethiopia and provides development assistance to \npromote democratic, citizen-responsive governance, and broad-based economic growth \nand prosperity. \nSince 2019, Ethiopia has increased its collaboration with the United States on \nregional security issues. It actively prosecutes crimes associated with terrorist activity. It \nalso provides the United States with information, evidence, and access to witnesses to \nfacilitate investigation of combat terrorist organizations. \nEthiopia has a poor human rights record. However, there is no evidence that it \ntargets the United States for military and economic intelligence or that its government \nmistreats its own citizens to gain military or economic information about the United States. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for assignment to a public trust position.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of payments, \npayment agreements, or other resolution of his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s nine-month unemployment was a \ncondition largely beyond his control. However, he has not acted responsibly. He has taken \nno significant actions to resolve his delinquent debts. To the contrary, he informed a \nsecurity investigator that he had decided to not pay them, because he was informed that \nthey would remain on his credit reports even if he paid them. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the cellphone debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. It is not \nestablished for the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and. \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (e) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). \n8 \n \nWhen family ties are at issue, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign \ncountry as well as each individual family tie must be considered.

May 16, 2011). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified [or sensitive] \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. \nNevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In \nconsidering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must also consider any \nterrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did \nnot consider terrorist activity in area where family members resided). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) are established. While Ethiopia is a friendly nation and is not \nknown to target the United States for economic or military intelligence, it suffers from \nethnic violence and is threatened by criminal activity, kidnapping, and terrorism from \nneighboring countries in East Africa. The vulnerability of Applicant\u2019s in-laws to coercion, \nthreats, and violence is sufficient to raise the heightened risk that he may be subjected to \nmanipulation, coercion, or intimidation through his wife or his in-laws. \nAG \u00b6 7(b) is established. There is a potential risk of a conflict of interest between \nthe interests of the United States and the safety and security of his in-laws in Ethiopia. \nApplicant has not rebutted the presumption that he has ties of obligation to his in-laws. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Ethiopia is a turbulent country, vulnerable to terrorist \nand criminal elements in surrounding countries. While it appears that Applicant\u2019s mother-\nin-law is no longer employed by the Ethiopian government, there is no evidence of the \nextent to which she has continued official or social contacts with employees of the \nEthiopian government. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant has deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States. He has was born, raised, and educated in the United States. \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Navy for almost 16 years and held a security \nclearance during his Navy service. He has worked for multiple defense contractors since \nhis discharge from the Navy. He has no immediate family members living in Ethiopia or \nother East African countries. He has virtually no contact with his in-laws in Ethiopia. His \nwife and three children live in the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not fully established. While Applicant\u2019s contact with his in-laws is \ninfrequent, he has not rebutted the presumption that those contacts are not casual. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and B in my whole-person \nanalysis. Because Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, \nI had no opportunity to evaluate his/her credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See \nISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and B, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness \nconcerns raised by his family connections to Ethiopia, but he has not mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude he has \nnot carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant \nhim eligibility for a public trust position. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations) AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

The adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napplied throughout the adjudication of this case were issued by the Director of National \nIntelligence (DNI) on December 10, 2016, and have been applied in all adjudicative \nactions taken on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that was received by Applicant on April 9, 2021. The FORM contained nine \nexhibits (Items 1 \u2013 9) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant was informed he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit additional \ninformation. Applicant did not submit additional information or object to the admission of \nany of the Government\u2019s documents into the record. The record closed on May 9, 2021, \nand I received the case for decision on July 20, 2021. \nProcedural Issue \nIncluded in the FORM is a copy of Applicant\u2019s driving record (FORM, Item 8). It \ncontains no information probative of any of the issues in this case, and Department \nCounsel made no mention of this document in the FORM and made no proffer of its \nrelevance to Applicant\u2019s suitability for clearance. I have not considered this exhibit in \nreaching my decision in this case. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that the mortgage on Applicant\u2019s house was \nforeclosed in 2018 (SOR 1.a), and that he owed $26,433 for nine other delinquent or past-\ndue debts (SOR 1.b \u2013 1.j). Applicant admitted with explanations the allegations at SOR \n1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h. He denied with explanations the remaining allegations of debt. \n(FORM, Items 1 and 2) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that in January 2018, Applicant was arrested \nand charged with felony grand larceny of a firearm; that he later pleaded guilty to a lesser \nincluded charge of trespassing; and that he was given a suspended sentence of 90 days \nin jail and ordered to pay restitution. (SOR 2.a) Applicant admitted that he was arrested \nand pleaded guilty as alleged in the SOR; however, he denied knowingly violating the \nspecific provision of his state\u2019s grand larceny statute pertaining to firearms under which \nhe was charged. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Applicant enlisted in March 1997 and retired as a petty officer \nfirst class in March 2017. (FORM, Item 3) \nApplicant was married in December 2000 and has two teenage children. Applicant \nand his wife separated in February 2015. As of the completion of this background \ninvestigation a final divorce was still pending. Applicant has another child, age 5, with a \nwoman to whom (as of the date of his SOR response) he is engaged to be married, and \nwith whom he has lived since February 2017. (FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nWhen Applicant and his wife separated, they entered into a private (i.e., not court-\nsupervised) agreement whereby Applicant agreed to pay his wife about $2,400 each \nmonth in child and spousal support. In exchange for that level of support, they agreed his \nwife would retain their marital residence. She further agreed to refinance the mortgage \non their house and, in so doing, have Applicant\u2019s name removed from the mortgage and \ndeed. For a variety of reasons, Applicant\u2019s wife did not refinance the mortgage or remove \nApplicant from the deed. She also was unable to find employment to earn sufficient \nincome to pay the mortgage, which was foreclosed in June 2018. Available information \nshows that the house was resold around the time of the foreclosure. In response to SOR \n1.a, Applicant claimed he does not have any remaining obligation under that mortgage; \nhowever, during a personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator on April \n17, 2019, Applicant stated that he and his wife jointly owed about $43,000 as a balance \nremainder after resale of the house. There is nothing in any of the credit reports submitted \nin the FORM that reflects Applicant owes any ongoing debt associated with the \nforeclosure. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 5) \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in January 2019, he disclosed the foreclosure \nalleged at SOR 1.a and the debts alleged in SOR 1.b \u2013 1.j. During his April 2019 PSI, he \ndiscussed all of those matters with a government investigator based on a report of \nApplicant\u2019s credit history obtained on February 14, 2019. Another credit report, obtained \nby adjudicators on December 10, 2019, also documents the debts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP disclosures and the credit reports provided in the FORM show that his \nfinancial problems began as early as 2008, while Applicant was still in the Navy and \nbefore he separated from his wife. (FORM, Items 3, 5, and 6) \nDuring his PSI and in response to the SOR, Applicant claimed that his financial \nproblems began when he retired from the Navy in March 2017. Even though he began \nhis civilian employment the next month, he avers he did not begin receiving his military \nretirement pay for \u201ca several months (sic) period.\u201d (Answer) As a result of that delay, he \nclaimed, his income was not sufficient to meet the child and spousal support he had \nagreed to pay when he and his wife separated in 2015. Applicant did not show how he \nwas able to meet his support obligations over the two years before he retired from the \nNavy, and he did not provide documentation of his civilian income starting in 2017 or of \nany delay in disbursement of his retired pay. (FORM, Items 1 \u2013 6) \nApplicant provided information in response to the SOR that showed the debts at \nSOR 1.b, 1.g and 1.i were paid or otherwise resolved either in February 2020 or October \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020. He further stated that he is disputing the debt at SOR 1.e. He claims it arose from \na failure of one cell phone provider to pay as agreed the cancellation penalties imposed \nby another cell phone provider when Applicant changed service providers. He did not \nsupport this claim with any corroborating documentation. (FORM, Item 2) \nApplicant states that he is now divorced. He further claims his support obligations \nare now $600 lower than the agreed upon amount at the time of his separation, and that \nhe now is able to pay his debts while still meeting his current financial obligations. \n(Answer) Applicant did not support these claims with any corroborating documentation, \nsuch as any information about his income and the current state of his personal finances, \nor about any more recent efforts to resolve his debts. \nIn June 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony grand larceny of a \nfirearm. He claims that a few months earlier, when his girlfriend needed money to cover \nunexpected travel expenses, she asked Applicant to pawn one of the handguns she \nowned and kept at their home. Applicant did so and the weapon, which turned out to be \na handgun given to her by her father, was held by the pawn shop as collateral for a $100 \nloan. A few months later, his girlfriend could not find her father\u2019s handgun and she \nreported to the police that it was stolen. As it turns out, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend intended that \nhe pawn a different handgun. When he realized his mistake, he went to retrieve the \nhandgun from the pawn shop. However, the police had identified the weapon as stolen \nproperty and Applicant learned he would be charged with stealing the weapon pursuant \nto a specific criminal statute in his state that makes the theft of a weapon a grand larceny \noffense regardless of the actual value of the weapon. Applicant turned himself in and was \ncharged as alleged in SOR 2.a. On advice of his attorney, he later accepted a plea bargain \nwhereby he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor trespassing offense. The court imposed a \n90-day jail sentence, which was suspended, and ordered Applicant to pay restitution. \n(FORM, Items 2, 3, 4, and 7) \nIn the FORM, the Government relies on Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, his e-\nQIP disclosure of his 2018 arrest, his explanation of those events in his PSI, and the FBI \narrest record obtained by investigators. Additionally, the Government proffered \ninformation about a 2001 event not alleged in the SOR. (FORM, Item 9) That information \nshows that, while in the Navy and entering a military installation, a random administrative \nvehicle inspection (AVI) of his car as he arrived at the gate produced contraband in the \nform of an ammunition clip for a .45-caliber handgun. No weapon was recovered and \nApplicant was not charged with any crime or other misconduct. He was detained without \narrest and turned over to his command, who verbally counseled him. This incident was \ndiscussed during his PSI. Applicant explained that he no longer owned the handgun, but \nhad forgotten there was a spare ammunition clip in the car. (FORM, Item 4) \nBased on the foregoing, the Government argues the following: \nWhile these instances are 17 years apart, [the 2001 AVI incident] \ndemonstrates Applicant\u2019s interest in guns and the sale of guns. There is \ncertainly nothing illegal about gun sales when done according to state and \nlocal law, but the (sic) government questions whether the Applicant has \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeen fully forthcoming regarding his activities in this area and the events \nsurrounding his 2018 arrest. (FORM at p. 4) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n5 \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAvailable information about Applicant\u2019s mortgage foreclosure and his record of \ndelinquent and past-due debts reasonably raises a security concern about his judgment \nand about the risk that he would engage in improper conduct to resolve his debts. That \nconcern is stated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Government provided sufficient, reliable information that shows Applicant \naccrued numerous delinquent debts starting before he retired from the Navy and before \nhe separated from his ex-wife. That information also shows that most of those debts \nremain unpaid or otherwise resolved. Additionally, the Government\u2019s information supports \nthe SOR 1.a allegation that the mortgage on Applicant\u2019s martial residence was foreclosed \nwhile he was jointly responsible for that obligation with his now ex-wife. This information \nestablishes the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) \n(a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant made claims and submitted information that \nrequire consideration of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nBased on my review of all of the available information, I conclude none of these \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are multiple and recent, in that they continue \nunresolved. Applicant established that his financial problems were at least exacerbated \nby the break-up of his marriage; however, this record also shows that he had already \naccrued delinquent or past-due debts while still married and serving on active duty. \nApplicant did not present information that shows his debts arose from circumstances \nbeyond his control or, if they did, that he has acted responsibly in response to those \nevents. Although some of his debts have been resolved, the majority of his financial \nproblems remain unresolved. Additionally, Applicant did not present information about the \nstate of his current finances from which it can be concluded that his finances no longer \npose an unacceptable risk under this guideline. Finally, Applicant did not document any \ngood-faith effort to pay his debts, and he did not support his claimed disputes with any of \nhis creditors. On balance, Applicant did not meet his burden of production in support of \nany of the available mitigating conditions. Accordingly, he failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe Government provided sufficient, reliable information that shows Applicant was \narrested in 2018 and charged with felony grand larceny of a firearm. That information also \nshows that Applicant pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of misdemeanor trespass, was \nsentenced to 90 days in jail, which was suspended, and ordered to pay restitution. This \ninformation reasonably raises a security concern about criminal conduct that is addressed \nat AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nMore specifically, available information supports application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 31(b) (evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted). \nThe Government appears to argue in support of AG \u00b6 31(a) (a pattern of minor \noffenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a national security \neligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness) by presenting information about the 2001 AVI seizure of \nhandgun ammunition from Applicant\u2019s car. This is something that was known to the \nGovernment during the investigation and adjudication of this case, yet not alleged in the \nSOR. Applicant was not charged with any criminal offense or reprimanded for any \nadministrative violation at that time. Instead, he received only verbal counseling from his \nmilitary chain of command. This information does not demonstrate \u201cApplicant\u2019s interest in \nguns and the sale of guns\u201d and it is not sufficient to impeach Applicant\u2019s credibility, even \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder the whole-person concept. Indeed, the Federal Rules of Evidence generally would \nexclude this use of 20-year-old information either to impeach credibility or to show a \npropensity towards the conduct addressed in SOR 2.a. \nAs to application of any of the mitigating factors listed under AG \u00b6 32, this record \nrequires consideration of the following: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nA review of all available information probative of these mitigating conditions shows \nthat none apply here. Applicant\u2019s arrest and misdemeanor guilty plea are less than three \nyears old. Not enough time has elapsed to establish that Applicant is unlikely to engage \nin such conduct again. This is especially true because, while Applicant claims he did not \nknowingly violate the law in his state regarding firearm theft, the court still imposed a 90-\nday jail sentence and ordered him to pay restitution, ostensibly to his girlfriend whose \nweapon he pawned. This undercuts any suggestion that there is no reliable evidence that \nhe committed a crime. On balance, Applicant did not meet his burden of presenting \ninformation sufficient to support a finding that he has mitigated the security concerns \nunder this guideline. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F and Guideline J, I have reviewed the record before \nme in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Nonetheless, Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to mitigate the security concerns raised by the facts established by the \nGovernment\u2019s information about his financial problems and his arrest record leaves \nunaltered the concurrent doubts about his judgment and reliability. Indeed, Applicant\u2019s \napparent violation of the law to obtain money when his financial problems were at their \nworst raises a security concern that goes to the heart of the government\u2019s concerns under \nGuideline F. Because protection of the national interest is the principal focus in these \nadjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against allowing access to \nsensitive information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

The final consumer debt, SOR \u00b6 1.g \nis a debt for $7,045. This debt has been resolved as part of a two-year repayment plan \nand the first installment was made in September 2020. \nApplicant held a series of low-paying labor positions since graduating from \ngraduate school in an effort to \u201ckeep a roof over my family\u2019s head.\u201d He discussed loan \nrepayments on his student loans, but was unable to make the \u201cup-front payments required \nby the agencies.\u201d (GE 2) His most significant employment with a defense contractor was \nobtained in 2019. Since the end of December 2020, he was promoted and received a pay \nraise to an annual income of about $80,000. Applicant also contacted his consumer \ncreditors and paid one debt and entered into a repayment plan on another. He was also \nable to enter into repayment schedules with DOE and Sallie Mae to consolidate and begin \nrepayments plans. He started payments in both plans, and appears to have sufficient \nmonthly income to pay debts and expenses. \nApplicant submitted a letter of support from his current manager who recommends \nApplicant as a trustworthy employee who complies with all rules and regulations. \nApplicant also noted his 100% disability from partial hearing impairment, and his child has \nthe same disability.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good- faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d (internal citation \nand footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nApplicant incurred financial delinquencies since leaving graduate school and while \nunemployed or underemployed. He began to address his debts once he was employed \nby his current employer. Since his promotion, he began repaying his student loans and \nhe resolved two consumer debts. Applicant made contact with creditors, arranged \npayment plans and paid one debt in full. Although I do not have evidence of professional \nfinancial counseling, Applicant has worked diligently to arrange repayment plans on his \nstudent loans and another consumer debt. His current credit report shows no other debts \nin collections. \nOverall, Applicant made significant efforts to resolve his debts once he became \nfinancially secure. I am convinced Applicant now makes good financial decisions, and his \nfinancial status no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Applicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment, but since a promotion with his current employer, he has acted \nresponsibly to resolve debts. I do not believe that further financial problems are likely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his debts since he was promoted. Applicant provided \nsufficient evidence to show reasonable resolution of the SOR debts and overall financial \nresponsibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or continue \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.p:\nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is granted. \nGregg A.

(Tr. 30) \nApplicant\u2019s problems with her finances trace to 2012. (GEs 2-6) Since 2015, she \nhas made little progress in paying and resolving her SOR-listed debts. Following the \ninitiation of foreclosure of a rental property she purchased in 1992, she was left with a \ndeficiency balance on a second trust deed in the amount of $41,431. (GEs 2-6) While \nforeclosure proceedings are currently on hold, the deficiency covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a \nremains unsatisfied and outstanding. To date, she has made no effort to reach out to \nthe explore the possibilities of a negotiated settlement. (Tr. 37-38) \nCurrently, Applicant is working with a legal group to resolve the debt. Monies she \nhas received from a state housing agency to support the rehabilitation and renovation of \nher rental properties are currently in a suspension status pending resolution of contract \nissues involving the properties. (Tr. 27-29) \nWhile Applicant claims to be working on payment plans with her remaining \ncreditors to resolve her debt delinquencies, to date, she has not been successful in \naddressing any of her outstanding SOR account. (GEs 2-6; Tr. 17-18, 39-49, 56-57) \nSeveral of her listed creditors that she contacted in 2019 reported no account record \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b61.c and 1.e). (Tr. 43-48) For other listed debts in which she received 1099 debt \ncancellation notices (SOR \u00b6 1,b), she has not declared her debt cancellations on her \ntax returns.

(Tr. 54) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThe guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must be considered before \ndeciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. \nAlthough, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the \nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n   Financial Considerations \n \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is  \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n                                               Burdens of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying \nconditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for financial considerations apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create  \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 19-\n02593 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, \n2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information. While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23, 2016; ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with her delinquent debt accumulations raises \nconsiderable concerns over her ability to manage her finances in a responsible and \nreliable way. \nExtenuating circumstances appear to have played some role in Applicant\u2019s debt \naccumulations. Mitigating condition (MCs) 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were likely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. \nHowever, the financial consequences imposed on her by the 2016 flood, together \nwith her assumption of caretaking responsibilities for her ill-stricken family members do \nnot adequately explain her post-2018 failure to make documented payment initiatives \nwith her individual creditors or follow-up with the creditors she contacted about the \navailability of payment plans. With so little financial information to work with on the state \nof her finances during this extended period of income reduction spanning 2016 and \n2018, no meaningful extenuation or credit can be assigned based on her claims of \nlimited income. \nAfforded opportunities to provide clarification of her financial conditions and \nexplanations of her lack of payment progress on her delinquent accounts, Applicant \nprovided no persuasive clarifications or explanations for (a) why she allowed her \naccounts to remain delinquent after returning to full-time employment in 2018; (b) why \nshe has failed to take any documented follow-up initiatives to pay and resolve her \ndelinquent debts. For lack of any documented repayment or financial counseling \ninitiatives by Applicant, other potentially available mitigating conditions cannot be \napplied to her situation. \nBased on her failure to date to establish a meaningful track record of addressing \nher delinquent debt deficiencies, it is too soon to make safe predictive assessments as \nto whether Applicant can restore her finances to stable levels consistent with minimum \nrequirements for holding a security clearance. Mitigation requirements are not met. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her accrued delinquent debts and her failure to sufficiently \naddress them heretofore are otherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a \nsecurity clearance.

He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 2002 to June 2015. He was ineligible to reenlist under the Navy high-year tenure rules due to his reduction in rate from culinary specialist second class (pay grade E-5) to culinary specialist third class (pay grade E-4), imposed as nonjudicial punishment in January 2014. He received an honorable discharge. During his Navy service, he was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, the Navy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal (four awards), and various service medals and qualification badges. He held a security clearance while in the Navy. (Tr. 8.)

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 5, 2019. \nOn October 16, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines D, E, and F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November \n28, 2020, and the case was assigned to me on December 14, 2020. On December 18, \n2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for January 7, 2021. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he submitted a copy of his request to set aside \nnonjudicial punishment, a copy of the favorable decision of an administrative separation \nboard, and five character statements that were presented at the administrative separation \nboard. His answer to the SOR and its enclosures were marked as Answer 1 through 22 \nand admitted in evidence. He did not submit any additional documentary evidence at the \nhearing. I kept the record open to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. \nHe timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 27, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, \n1.e, 2.c-2.e, 3.b, 3.e, 3.f, and 3.i-3.k. He denied the allegations in SOR 1.d, 2.b, 3.c, 3.d, \n3.g, 3.h, and 3.i-3.q. He did not expressly admit or deny the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a, \nwhich cross-alleges the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i, and SOR \u00b6 3.a, which cross-alleges \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old able-bodied seaman employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 2002 to June \n2015. He was ineligible to reenlist under the Navy high-year tenure rules due to his \nreduction in rate from culinary specialist second class (pay grade E-5) to culinary \nspecialist third class (pay grade E-4), imposed as nonjudicial punishment in January \n2014. He received an honorable discharge. During his Navy service, he was awarded the \nGood Conduct Medal, the Navy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal (four awards), and \nvarious service medals and qualification badges. He held a security clearance while in \nthe Navy. (Tr. 8.) \nApplicant worked as an able-bodied seaman for a non-government employer from \nJune to December 2016, when he quit this job for what he considered a better career \nopportunity. He worked as a railroad conductor from January 2017 until he was hired by \nhis current employer. (GX 1 at 17-18.) He is still employed, but he has been in a no-pay \nstatus since October 2020, when the SOR was issued. He was earning about $49,000 \nper year before he was placed in a no-pay status. (Tr. 27.) \nApplicant attended a maritime academy from February to June 2014 and received \na certificate. He attended a university from February 2017 to June 2019 and received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in advanced culinary arts. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant married in September 2007 and divorced in May 2015. He married his \ncurrent spouse in August 2017. He has two children from his first marriage, ages 16 and \n12, and two stepchildren, ages 22 and 21. \nIn June or July 2012, Applicant was accused by a female sailor of kissing her three \ntimes against her will. When Applicant was questioned by an investigator from the Naval \nCriminal Investigative Service (NCIS), he admitted kissing her once on her hand. (GX 3 \nat 14.) Applicant\u2019s commanding officer issued a military protective order prohibiting the \nfemale sailor and Applicant from having any contact, and Applicant was transferred to a \nnew duty station aboard the ship. In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR he admitted the \nallegation and said that he and the female sailor were dating at the time. \nIn July 2013, Applicant was issued another military protective order after another \nfemale sailor alleged that he had made inappropriate sexual advances. He and this \nfemale sailor had previously engaged in \u2018rough\u201d sexual intercourse aboard the ship, in \nwhich he choked her, believing that she enjoyed it. In October 2013, this female sailor \naccused Applicant of touching her inappropriately while she was standing watch at night \naboard their ship. When Applicant was interviewed by the NCIS, he told an investigator \nthat the sailor had placed his hand on her breast and had put his hands on her neck \nbecause she enjoys being choked while having sex. (GX 3 at 5-6, 9-11.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he and the female sailor had a conversation \nwhile she was on duty on the flight deck at night, while the protective order was still in \neffect. She began groping him, and he groped her in return, and they began kissing each \nother. He denied trying to force her to perform fellatio on him, as she later claimed. (Tr. \n39-41.) He admitted violating the military protective order to stay away from the female \nsailor. (Tr. 60.) During the NCIS investigation, the female sailor told investigators that she \ndid not feel harassed by Applicant, that she was pressured to make a statement against \nhim, and that she would not participate in non-judicial proceedings against him. (GX 3 at \n15.) \nIn January 2014, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment from the captain of his \nship for abusive sexual contact and assault on the female sailor. Applicant\u2019s punishment \nwas reduction in rate from culinary specialist second class (pay grade E-5) to culinary \nspecialist third class (pay grade E-4) and forfeiture of half of his pay per month for two \nmonths. (Answer at 6-7.) \n \nDuring the NCIS investigation of Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct in July 2013, three \nother female sailors reported that he had sexually harassed them by repeated sexual \ncomments and attempting to kiss them. One sailor told an investigator that Applicant \nrepeatedly told her she was \u201chot.\u201d A second female sailor told an investigator that \nApplicant repeatedly tried to kiss her hand or forehead. A third female sailor told an \ninvestigator that Applicant told her, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I would do to you.\u201d (GX 3 at 15.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he sometimes complimented the female sailors on \ntheir appearance, but that he made no derogatory or inappropriate comments. (Tr. 51-\n54.) He admitted telling female sailors that \u201cthey looked good and they were hot.\u201d (Tr. 56.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nIn late 2013 or early 2014, Applicant was transferred from the ship to shore duty because \nhis superiors believed his conduct created a hostile work environment. (GX 3 at 11.) He \nwas issued another military protective order in April 2014. (GX 3 at 15.) \nOn May 1, 2014, Applicant appeared before an administrative separation board, \nand the board unanimously found that the evidence did not support the allegations against \nhim. A document submitted by Applicant reflects that the board was convened to consider \nallegations of \u201cMisconduct\u2014Commission of a Serious Offense,\u201d but it does not reflect the \nspecific acts of misconduct considered by the board. (Answer at 9.) \nOn May 2, 2014, Applicant requested that his commander set aside the nonjudicial \npunishment. (Answer at 6-8.) The record does not reflect the response, if any, to his \nrequest. He was discharged on May 5, 2014, at the end of his enlistment, and received \nan honorable discharge. (GX 2 at 4.) Because of his reduction in rate, he was ineligible \nto reenlist. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he \nhad been \u201csubject to court-martial or other disciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice (UCMJ) such as Article 15, Captain\u2019s mast, Article 135 Court of inquiry, \netc.\u201d He did not disclose the nonjudicial punishment that resulted in his reduction in rate. \nDuring a personal subject interview (PSI) in January 2020, he told an investigator that he \nwas not subject to court-martial or other disciplinary actions while on active duty. He later \nadmitted to the investigator that he was charged with an offense under the UCMJ but that \nhe was acquitted, which is why he did not disclose it in his SCA. (GX 2 at 9-10.) At the \nhearing, he admitted that he should have disclosed his nonjudicial punishment in the \nSCA, but he \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d (Tr. 72.) His failures to disclose his nonjudicial punishment \nin the SCA or during the PSI were not alleged in the SOR. \nAfter Applicant was discharged from the Navy, he was a probationary employee of \nanother federal agency from May 2015 to August 2016. He worked a 30-day schedule, \nwith 30-day intervals of unemployment, during which he received unemployment benefits. \nHis annual pay from this federal agency was about $50,000 per year. \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, he stated that he was laid off from this position with another \nfederal agency. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he had been fired, quit after \nbeing told he would be fired, left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct, or left my mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. \n(GX 1 at 19.) During the January 2020 PSI, he told a security investigator that he did not \nbelieve he was fired. (GX 2 at 8.) However, in his answer to the SOR, he admitted that \nhe was terminated for misuse of the government credit card and \u201cfailure to pay \nobligations.\u201d \nIn the same SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether, in the last seven \nyears, he had been counseled, warned, or disciplined for violating the terms of agreement \nfor a travel or credit card provided by his employer. (GX 1 at 43.) During the PSI, he told \nthe investigator that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question because he did not receive any \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwritten or oral reprimands and was not suspended. (GX 2 at 8.) In his answer to the SOR, \nhe stated that he did not knowingly misuse the credit card. (Answer at 2.) At the hearing, \nhe testified that his personal credit cards had been stolen, he did not have any cash, and \nhe used the government credit card for food and materials that he needed for his work, \nsuch as foul weather gear, while he was on temporary duty away from his home and \nprimary duty station. (Tr. 82-85.) He testified that he did not promptly pay off the charges \non the credit-card account because he was sent on another temporary duty assignment. \nHe made some payments on the account but never paid it in full. (Tr. 86.) \nThe SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts that are reflected in credit reports from \nDecember 2019, May 2020, and December 2020. (GX 4, 5, and 6.) The evidence \nconcerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b: payday loan account referred for collection of $1,427. In the PSI, \nApplicant admitted this debt and stated that he was making payments on it. (GX 2 at 14.) \nThe December 2020 credit report reflects that this debt became delinquent in May 2019 \nand is unpaid. (GX 6 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he had not made any payments \non this debt. (Tr. 102.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.d: delinquent medical bills for $222 and $70. In the PSI, \nApplicant admitted both of these debts, and stated that both bills should have been \ncovered by his insurance. (GX 2 at 13.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that the $222 \nbill had been paid and that he was disputing the $70 bill because it should have been \ncovered by his insurance. He did not submit any documentation showing that the $222 \nbill was paid. The May 2020 credit report reflects that the $222 bill is unpaid. (GX 5 at 2.) \nThe December 2020 credit report reflects that the $70 bill has been paid. (GX 6 at 1-2.). \nSOR \u00b6 3.e: unsecured loan referred for collection of $1,619. In the PSI, \nApplicant admitted this debt and stated that he was trying to settle it for less than the full \namount. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he was disputing it because it \u201cwas \nmade for ex-wife.\u201d The December 2020 credit report reflects that the debt is unpaid and \ndisputed, with the comment, \u201cconsumer disputes after resolution.\u201d (GX 6 at 2.) The debt \nis not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 3.f: deficiency of $6,131 after vehicle repossession In the PSI, Applicant \nstated that he voluntarily surrendered this vehicle after he lost his job with another federal \nagency and could not afford the payments. (GX 2 at 12.) In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant stated that his ex-wife had possession of the vehicle and defaulted on the \npayments after she lost her job. The December 2020 credit report reflects that the last \npayment on this debt was in January 2015. (GX 6 at 4) Applicant testified that his divorce \ndecree included his wife\u2019s agreement to pay this debt. (Tr. 106.) After the hearing, he \nprovided a copy of his divorce decree, which recites that he and his ex-wife had executed \na property settlement that had been filed with the papers in the case. (AX E at 2.) \nHowever, Applicant did not include a copy the property settlement in his post-hearing \nsubmission. The debt is not resolved. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.g: telecommunications account charged off for $157. In the PSI, \nApplicant attributed this debt to identify theft and denied that it was his debt. (GX 2 at 12.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, he stated that the debt was paid in full. The May 2020 credit \nreport reflects that Applicant disputed the debt, it was charged off, and the account was \nclosed. However, the credit report still reflects a past due amount of $157. (GX 5 at 3.) \nThe debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 3.h: unsecured loan referred for collection of $1,219. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he denied this debt, stating that it should have been removed from \nhis credit report. The December 2020 credit report reflects that the debt became \ndelinquent in July 2014, the collection account was opened in July 2019, and that \nApplicant disputed the debt. (GX 6 at 2.) The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 3.i: deficiency after vehicle repossession charged off for $19,059. In \nthe PSI, Applicant explained that this vehicle was a total loss after an accident, but that \nthe insurance company paid less than the amount owed. (GX 2 at 13.) He admitted this \ndebt in his answer to the SOR, but stated that he was disputing the amount with the \ninsurance company. At the hearing, he testified that the lender falsely represented that \nhis contract included gap insurance. He was unable to produce documentation showing \nthat his finance contract included gap insurance. The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 3.j: unsecured loan charged off for $1,620. Applicant admitted this debt \nin his answer to the SOR. The May 2020 and December 2020 credit reports reflect that \nthe account was opened in December 2019, became delinquent in January 2020, and \nwas charged off. (GX 5 at 4; GX 6 at 3.) Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor \nfive days before the hearing and offered to pay $75 every two weeks but had not received \na response. (Tr. 113.) The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 3.k: military credit-card account referred for collection of $1,508. In \nthe PSI, Applicant stated that he intended to make a settlement offer in June 2020. The \nMay 2020 and December 2020 credit reports reflect that the account became delinquent \nin April 2016 and that no payments have been made. (GX 5 at 4; GX 6 at 3.) Applicant \ntestified that he contacted the creditor in June 2020, and was he informed that it was not \naccepting settlements because of the COVID-19 virus, and that he should contact them \nagain in June 2021. (Tr. 115-16.) The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 3.l: child-support arrearage referred for collection of $25,900. In \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his ex-wife had waived the child-support \nrequirement. The divorce decree, dated May 21, 2015, recites that there was no child-\nsupport arrearage as of that date. (AX E at 5.) The child-support arrearage is reflected in \nthe December 2019 credit report. (GX 4 at 6.) The May 2020 and December 2020 credit \nreports reflect a paid collection account with a zero balance due. (GX 5 at 5; GX 6 at 3.) \nDepartment of Social Services records also reflect a zero balance. (AX A; AX C.)

After the hearing, he submitted documentary \nevidence that it was paid. (AX B; AX D.) \nSOR \u00b6 3.q: satellite television bill referred for collection of $881. This debt is \nreflected in the December 2019 credit report (GX 4 at 7.) In the PSI, he stated that the \ndebt was for equipment that was not returned, but that he had returned the equipment. \n(GX 2 at 13.) He did not provide any documentation showing the status of this debt. It is \nnot resolved. \nApplicant testified that he receiving financial counseling through the Department \nof Veterans Affairs a couple of years ago. (Tr. 125.) He also testified that he had hired a \nlaw firm to assist him in resolving his debts, but he terminated them because they were \nnot helping him. He has now hired another firm. This firm helps him dispute questionable \ndebts and to help him dispute some of the debts, negotiate settlements, and make \npayments. He pays the firm $89 per month.

In the \nPSI, he told an investigator that he did not disclose the delinquent debts because he did \nnot know that they had been referred for collection and that he had paid some of them. \n(GX 2 at 11.) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the falsification. \nApplicant\u2019s site manager for the past year submitted a letter attesting to his good \ncharacter. He states that Applicant is an integral part of his team, with a great attitude, \nperseverance, and work ethic, and that they look forward to his return.

A chief warrant officer three with 23 years of service had \nknown Applicant for six years and described him as a great sailor who always performed \nabove his pay grade, a leader who needs no supervision, always courteous and \nrespectful, with a deep passion for the Navy and his sailors. (Answer at 15-16.) A chief \npetty officer who supervised Applicant for six months on shore duty described him as \nresponsible, respectful, and reliable. (Answer at 17-18.) Another chief petty officer, who \nwas the leading chief petty officer for the shore-based command to which Applicant was \ntemporarily assigned, described him as reliable, trustworthy, mature, and dependable, to \nthe extent that he was assigned to the unit\u2019s staff. (Answer at 19-21.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior) \nThe SOR alleges that around June and July 2012, Applicant kissed a female sailor, \nidentified as OS3 three times against her will (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that in July 2013, he was issued \na military protective order to stay away from a female sailor, identified as BMSN, following \nallegations of inappropriate sexual advances and harassment (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that in \nOctober 2013, he violated the military protective order by engaging in sexual contact with \nBMSM, and was issued another military protective order to stay away from BMSM (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c); that in late 2013 to early 2014, he was transferred to a new duty station after three \nother female sailors, identified as CS3, CS2, and CS1, complained that he had sexually \nharassed them (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that in April 2014, he was issued another military \nprotective order for abusive sexual contact in January 2014 and was processed for \nadministrative separation (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. . . . \n \nThe evidence reflects that the military protective order alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was \nfor the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and the processing for administrative separation in \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was based on the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. As such, the \nallegations of military protective orders and the administrative separation duplicate the \nallegations of acts that were the basis for the orders and administrative separation. When \nthe same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the same guideline, the \nduplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). Thus, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nThe evidence supporting the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d is sufficient to establish \nthe disqualifying condition under this guideline in AG \u00b6 13(a): \u201csexual behavior of a \ncriminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d The relevant \nmitigating conditions are: \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \n \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s abusive sexual behavior \noccurred more than seven years ago and has not recurred. He has had no contact with \nthe sailors involved in his conduct since his discharge from the Navy. He has remarried, \nhas two children, and is now focused on his family rather than casual sexual activity. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the sexual conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nIt also alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment by another federal agency \nfor misuse of a government credit card and failure to pay his obligations incurred with the \ncredit card (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The SOR further alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA in three \nparticulars: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) By answering \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether, in the last seven years, he had been \ncounseled, warned, or disciplined for violating the terms of agreement for a travel or credit \ncard provided by his employer, and failing to disclose that he was terminated by the other \nfederal agency for misuse of a government credit card and failure to pay the obligation \nincurred with the credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and \n \n \n(3) By answering \u201cNo\u201d to questions whether, in the last seven years, he had been \ndelinquent on alimony or child-support payments, defaulted on any type of loan, or had \nbills or debts turned over to a collection agency, and failing to disclose the debts and \ndelinquencies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b through 3.q (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) By stating that he was laid off from his employment by another federal agency \nwhen in fact he was terminated for his misuse of a government credit card and failure to \npay the obligation incurred with the credit card (SOR \u00b6 2.c); \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s false answers to questions in his SCA establish the following \ndisqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant knew that he was terminated because of his misuse of a government \ncredit card. While he may not have understood all the limitations on use of a government \ncredit card, he also knew that he had not paid the credit-card charges incurred with the \ngovernment credit card. \nApplicant also knew that he had serious financial problems, including several \nvehicle repossessions and delinquent loans. His explanation that he did not know that the \naccounts had been referred for collection is implausible and unconvincing. \nA security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or \nparse the truth narrowly. The government has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information. That compelling interest includes the government's \nlegitimate interest in being able to make sound decisions, based on complete and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccurate information, about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government \nin connection with a security clearance investigation or adjudication interferes with the \nintegrity of the industrial security program. ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n8, 2002). \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe SOR cross-alleges the misuse of a government credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.b (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and alleges 16 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.3.q). The security concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s divorce and the car accident that \nresulted in the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.i were conditions largely beyond his control. \nHowever, his reduction in rate that resulted in his inability to continue his Navy career and \nhis termination of employment by another federal agency were due to his misconduct and \nwere not the result of conditions beyond his control. Furthermore, he has not acted \nresponsibly. He has taken no action to resolve the delinquent payday loan alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 3.b. Although he claimed that he had gap insurance on the vehicle involved in SOR \u00b6 \n3.i, he provided no evidence of efforts to resolve the problem with the car dealer or the \ninsurance company. He did not contact the creditor for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.j until \nfive days before the hearing. The credit-card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.k became \ndelinquent in April 2016, but he did not contact the creditor until June 2020. He claimed \nthat the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.m, 3.n, 3.o, and 3.q were resolved, but he submitted \nno documentation to support his claim. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant testified that he had hired a debt-resolution \nagency and was paying it $89 per month to dispute and resolve his delinquent debts. \nThere is no evidence that the debt-resolution agency provides the type of counseling \ncontemplated by this mitigating condition. Furthermore, he provided no documentation \nshowing that it had made any progress in resolving his debts. The debt counseling he \nreceived from the Department of Veterans Affairs VA may qualify under this mitigating \ncondition, but Applicant\u2019s financial situation is not under control. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c and the child-\nsupport arrearage alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.l. It is not established for the other delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputed the medical bill alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 3.d, the telecommunications bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.g, the delinquent loan alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 3.h, and the repossession deficiency alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.i. but he provided no \ndocumentation of the basis for his disputes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, E, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s inappropriate sexual \nbehavior, his military superiors strongly supported him when he appeared before an \nadministrative separation board, enabling him to avoid a less than honorable discharge. \nHis current employer strongly supports his application for a security clearance and intends \nto restore him to his former position if a clearance is granted. However, Applicant\u2019s lack \nof candor in his SCA and his lack of financial responsibility raise serious doubts about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines D, E, and F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nunder Guideline D, but he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his lack of \ncandor in his SCA and his continuing financial problems. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D (Sexual Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a, 3.b, 3.d-3.k, and 3.m-3.q: Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.c and 3.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He has a bachelor\u2019s degree that was awarded in 1999 and a master\u2019s degree that he earned in 2007. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 15, 17, 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE B) Applicant has a problematic history, primarily related to the workplace. He also had legal and financial issues. He worked for a state government in information technology (IT) from 2002 through 2008. He was placed on administrative leave from about December 2007 until he was terminated in about February 2008. Applicant felt that he was wrongfully terminated. He stated that he was sexually harassed by a supervisor, and that his suspension and termination could have been related to his rebuffs of his supervisor. Applicant retained an attorney to file a wrongful termination case, but he decided not to pursue it after he was hired at another job. (Tr.at 18-21; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) He wrote in his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86): The issue of wrongful termination stemmed from a day I was out sick and the supervisor gave an office, which he promised to give to me on multiple occasions, to a person who had only been with us a month or so, I moved my stuff into the office and put her stuff into my old of",

The new allegation is as follows: \nh. From about 2015 to 2016, you provided more than $100,000 to a \nwoman for a business venture, without due diligence, business \ndocumentation, or accounting. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1994 \nuntil he was honorably discharged in 1996. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree that was \nawarded in 1999 and a master\u2019s degree that he earned in 2007. He has never married, \nand he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 15, 17, 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1; AE B) \nApplicant has a problematic history, primarily related to the workplace. He also \nhad legal and financial issues. He worked for a state government in information \ntechnology (IT) from 2002 through 2008. He was placed on administrative leave from \nabout December 2007 until he was terminated in about February 2008. Applicant felt \nthat he was wrongfully terminated. He stated that he was sexually harassed by a \nsupervisor, and that his suspension and termination could have been related to his \nrebuffs of his supervisor. Applicant retained an attorney to file a wrongful termination \ncase, but he decided not to pursue it after he was hired at another job. (Tr.at 18-21; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) He wrote in his Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86): \nThe issue of wrongful termination stemmed from a day I was out sick and \nthe supervisor gave an office, which he promised to give to me on multiple \noccasions, to a person who had only been with us a month or so, I moved \nmy stuff into the office and put her stuff into my old office. The following \nMonday I was told to move my stuff back or else, so I complied with the \nrequest. Some things were said and the next thing I know I am getting an \nadministrative leave letter which does not even state why I am being put \non leave. \nApplicant worked for a defense contracting company from 2009 until he was \nterminated in 2015. He received a verbal warning in April 2014 for his attendance and \nunprofessional behavior. He received a written warning in June 2014 for continued \nattendance issues and for a verbal disagreement that resulted in the customer\u2019s request \nto have Applicant temporarily removed from the facility. The written warning also stated \nthat Applicant openly criticized management, used profanity, and made inappropriate \ncomments. (Tr. at 22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \nApplicant received a final written warning in July 2014. He had an inappropriate \ndialogue with the company\u2019s customer by criticizing their decision about his training. He \nwas terminated in March 2015 after he sent an inappropriate email to a military service \nmember using his military email account, in which he asked the service member for a \ndate. (Tr. at 22-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant stated that he worked for the company for six years, and he had a good \nrecord at the company for five years, until he received a new manager who was not very \nprofessional. Applicant stated that there were \u201cpersonality conflicts\u201d with the new \nmanager. He stated that his attendance was always good. He admitted sending the \nemail to the service member, but he stated that he just asked her to lunch, and there \nwas nothing rude or inappropriate about the email.

He \nreceived a written warning in July 2016 for a misconfigured production server. Applicant \nstated that his supervisor did not provide him with guidance on the correct configuration \nof the server. Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in August 2016. \nHe was still a probationary employee, and he was terminated after he reported the DWI \nto his employer. He stated that he stopped drinking after the DWI. (Tr. at 27-28, 38; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \n \nApplicant met a woman in 2015. She suggested they be just friends and go into \nbusiness together selling items that were manufactured in China. He still had feelings \nfor her and agreed. He signed an agreement, but she did not. He withdrew funds from \nhis 401(k) retirement account and gave her money. She convinced him that she needed \nto move to a larger metropolitan area to sell her goods. He paid her rent $3,600-per-\nmonth rent and also paid for a trip to Europe for her to sell her goods. Applicant finally \nrealized that she was a con artist, and he had been scammed of about $100,000. (Tr. at \n30-37; GE 2  \n \n \nApplicant did not pay the IRS and his state all the taxes owed when he withdrew \nthe funds from his 401(k). For tax year 2015, he owed $41,315 in federal taxes, and his \nwithholding was $9,665, leaving a balance in excess of $31,000. The IRS applied \n$3,904 from his 2016 refund and $2,528 from his 2017 refund to the amount owed for \n2015. The IRS accepted Applicant\u2019s offer in compromise. He paid $19,000 in January \n2017, and the IRS wrote off the balance of $8,821 in June 2018.

He asserted that his security \nclearance should not be denied \u201cbased solely on a few bad bosses.\u201d He stated that he \nhas always been diligent about protecting sensitive information, and he is highly \nregarded by his current employer, where he has worked for four years. (Tr. at 48-50; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant also accrued more than $35,000 in credit card and other debt. He filed \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in January 2017, and his debts were discharged in April \n2017. He stated that his finances are currently in good shape.

He is praised for his excellent work performance, moral \ncharacter, friendly and calm demeanor, courtesy, dedication, work ethic, and \nprofessionalism. He was described by his supervisor in 2013 as \u201can ideal employee.\u201d \n(AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant was terminated from three jobs, all related to some type of \ninappropriate conduct. His conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable to the workplace \nmisconduct. AG \u00b6 16(c) also has some applicability to the job he lost because of the \nDWI, because the DWI could have been alleged under the alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct guidelines. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant received a written warning for a misconfigured \nproduction server. Applicant stated that his supervisor did not provide him with guidance \non the correct configuration of the server. There is insufficient evidence that the warning \nwas related to Applicant\u2019s misconduct as opposed to his competence to do his job, at \nleast in that specific instance. Being incompetent at one\u2019s job may be a problem for an \nemployer, but it is not enough to raise a personal conduct security concern. SOR \u00b6 1.b \nis concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g allege that Applicant was placed on administrative \nleave or received a written warning for inappropriate conduct in the workplace. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.f allege that Applicant was fired because of inappropriate conduct. The \nallegations that he was fired include the underlying conduct alleged in the other \nallegations. When the same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g are \nconcluded for Applicant. \nThe essence of SOR \u00b6 1.h is that Applicant was scammed by a woman out of \nmore than $100,000. Being a victim of a con means that a person may be gullible, but it \nwould not ordinarily raise personal conduct security concerns. However, Applicant\u2019s \nactions to fund the enterprise raise concerns. He was so enamored with the woman that \nhe was willing to ignore his fundamental requirement to pay his taxes. He also \noverextended himself financially to the point that he had to file a bankruptcy case in \n2017. He showed questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, and it is strong evidence that he is vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, \nand duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable to the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant stated that there were \u201cpersonality conflicts\u201d at work; he was a good \nemployee; and that his security clearance should not be denied \u201cbased solely on a few \nbad bosses.\u201d He also admitted that he moved a coworker\u2019s belongings out of an office \nand moved into the office without permission, and then \u201c[s]ome things were said\u201d; he \nsent an inappropriate email to a military service member using his military email after \ntwo written warnings about his conduct; and he was terminated because of his poor \ndecision to drive after drinking. Finally, Applicant showed that he can be manipulated \ninto violating a fundamental legal requirement to pay his taxes. Applicant is vulnerable \nto coercion, exploitation, and duress. His behavior continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions are not \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence, but those factors were \noutweighed by Applicant\u2019s multiple incidents of poor judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior field support coordinator with his current sponsor since July 2019. He previously served as a senior telecom project coordinator with another employer from March 2009 until July 2019. A 1993 high school graduate, he attended a university for several years earning college credits, but no degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was initially granted a secret clearance in 2002, and it was renewed in 2009.

On September 11, 2020, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn an unspecified date, thought by Department Counsel to be September 25, \n2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on March 8, 2021, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on March 29, 2021. His \nresponse was due on April 28, 2021. Applicant timely responded to the FORM, and he \nsubmitted a statement to which there was no objection. The case was assigned to me on \nMay 4, 2021. The record closed on April 28, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations \npertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings \nof fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a senior field support coordinator with his current sponsor since July 2019. He \npreviously served as a senior telecom project coordinator with another employer from \nMarch 2009 until July 2019. A 1993 high school graduate, he attended a university for \nseveral years earning college credits, but no degree. He has never served with the U.S. \nmilitary. He was initially granted a secret clearance in 2002, and it was renewed in 2009. \nHe reported that he has never been married, and that he had no children, but during an \ninterview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in \nAugust 2019, he acknowledged having two children, born four months apart in 2010. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can \nbe found in the following exhibits: Item 7 (Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition, filed June 24, \n2010); Item 6 (Court Record of Bankruptcy Filings, dated May 6, 2020); Item 5 (Chapter \n7 Bankruptcy Petition, filed May 22, 2019); Item 3 (SF 86, dated July 25, 2019); Item 4 \n(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated August 7, 2019); and \nItem 8 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated August 14, 2019). \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties going back over a decade that have \nresulted in many accounts becoming delinquent.

(Item 2, at 1) He reported approximately \n$257,986 in liabilities with creditors holding secured claims (state tax lien; a judgment \nlien; a vehicle; and a mortgage); $4,000 in liabilities with creditors holding unsecured \npriority claims (federal income tax); and $69,137 in liabilities with creditors holding \nunsecured nonpriority claims (various commercial accounts; credit cards; a time-share; \nand student loans). At the time, he reported an average net monthly income of \napproximately $2,572, and an identical amount in monthly expenditures. He reaffirmed \nthe mortgage debt, but because this was considered as a no-asset bankruptcy, most of \nhis other debts were discharged on October 14, 2010. (Item 7) \nBetween December 2010 and January 2016, Applicant filed for bankruptcy \nprotection under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on seven occasions. On each \noccasion, the case was dismissed. (Item 2, at 1; Item 6) He made no assertions, and \noffered no documentation, to support any conclusion that the Trustees involved in any of \nthe Chapter 13 filings had completed a payment plan, received funds from Applicant, or \nmade any payments to any creditors. Furthermore, there were no assertions by Applicant \nthat he had paid the Trustees any funds. Instead, he stated that his intention for filing \nunder Chapter 13 \u201cwas to help retain all of [his] assets house, cars, boat and other assets \nthat belong to [him].\u201d (Response to FORM) \nIn May 2019, he again filed a voluntary petition seeking bankruptcy protection \nunder Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. (Item 2, at 2) He reported approximately \n$199,829 in liabilities with creditors holding secured claims (a mortgage); and $99,956 in \nliabilities with creditors holding unsecured priority claims (domestic support obligations to \ntwo separate women; commercial accounts; credit cards; and student loans). At the time, \nhe reported an average net monthly income of approximately $1,856, and $2,631 in \nmonthly expenditures, leaving him with a deficit of approximately $775. On August 30, \n2019, because this was considered as a no-asset bankruptcy, most of his debts were \ndischarged. (Item 5) During his OPM interview, Applicant estimated that his liabilities \ntotaled around $10,000, and they were purportedly caused because of the expenses he \nwas left with following his father\u2019s funeral costs. (Item 8, at 5) His reason for filing under \nChapter 7 was \u201cto remove the debts and give [himself] a fresh start to rebuild and \nreestablish good credit.\u201d (Response to FORM) \nApplicant acknowledged that in addition to those funeral expenses, he charged his \ntravel, clothing, jewelry, and dining out on his credit cards to the point where they became \n\u201cmaxed out.\u201d (Item 8, at 5) Nevertheless, he denied that his accounts were delinquent \nbefore he filed for bankruptcy, claiming, instead, that his attorney had advised him to stop \npaying his creditors. (Item 8, at 5) He acknowledged that he had over-extended himself \nfinancially, and did not think he would be able to pay his debts, so he filed for bankruptcy. \n(Item 8, at 9) With respect to his travel expenses, between August 2015 and April 2019, \nApplicant took several international trips to Mexico (three occasions), as well as trips to \nJamaica, Barbados, Belize, Honduras, and Costa Rica.

(Item 2) His current net monthly income and \nmonthly expenses are not known. It is also unknown if he has a monthly remainder \navailable for discretionary spending or savings. Furthermore, there is no evidence of \nfinancial counseling or a budget. Accordingly, it is difficult to determine if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been, or if he has returned to his \nearlier spendthrift ways. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged two Chapter 7 bankruptcies (October 2010 and May 2019), as \nwell as seven Chapter 13 bankruptcies between December 2010 and January 2016. He \nacknowledged that he had over-extended himself financially, by charging his travel, \nclothing, jewelry, and dining out on his credit cards to the point where they became \n\u201cmaxed out,\u201d and did not think he would be able to pay his debts, so he filed for \nbankruptcy. Between August 2015 and April 2019, he took several international trips. \nBased on his own description of events, it appears that while he may have at several \npoints had an inability to satisfy at least some of his debts, there were also times when \nhe had the ability to satisfy some of his debts, but chose not to do so in anticipation of \nfiling for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies because of the unanticipated expenses associated \nwith his father\u2019s funeral, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)). Applicant misused his credit cards \u2013 essentially unlimited spending on jewelry, \ninternational travel, and dining out \u2013 without limitation, at least until his credit cards were \n\u201cmaxed out.\u201d As a result, some accounts became delinquent, or Applicant thought the \nbalances were too high for him to even attempt to resolve them. At various times, he had \na tax lien for unpaid taxes; he owed federal income taxes; and he was behind on domestic \nsupport obligations to two women. Based on the evidence, it appears that Applicant \nsimply led the good life on credit, but ignored his accounts until such time that he sought \nbankruptcy protection from his creditors. He was successful in 2010 and 2019, when most \nof his liabilities were discharged. In between those Chapter 7 discharges, he tactically \nfiled for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 seven times, only to have those \nbankruptcies dismissed. \nApplicant has displayed a disinterest in paying his creditors for the items and \nservices he received. His reason for filing under Chapter 13 was to help retain all of his \nassets \u2013 house, cars, boat and other assets \u2013 that belonged to him. His reason for filing \nunder Chapter 7 was to remove the debts and give himself a fresh start to rebuild and \nreestablish good credit. He made no assertions, and offered no documentation, to support \nany conclusion that the Trustees involved in any of the Chapter 13 filings had completed \na payment plan, received funds from Applicant, or made any payments to any creditors. \nThere were no assertions by Applicant that he had paid the Trustees any funds. Applicant \nhas a security clearance and was aware that financial issues could present a problem for \nhim when the time for renewal arose. In an effort to minimize his difficulties, he filed for \nbankruptcy again in May 2019, just months before he completed his SF 86. An applicant \nwho begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or \nher security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her \nown interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR \nCase No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant chose, again, to avoid \nresponsibility for his debts by simply filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. Repeatedly \nwalking away from legitimate debts incurred by living the \u201cgood life\u201d \u2013 traveling \ninternationally, dining out, and maxing out credit cards without restraint \u2013 is worse than \nmaking hollow promises to pay debts in the future without any effort to do so. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and his \nrepeated general failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them are sufficient to \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nconclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. The absence of any efforts to \nresolve his debts short of having them repeatedly discharged under bankruptcy is not \nreasonable or honorable. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nApplicant\u2019s absence of any good-faith efforts to resolve his debts, and his repeated \nreliance in Chapter 7 to have his debts discharged, under the circumstances cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

He has been serving as a \nsenior field support coordinator with his current sponsor since July 2019. He previously \nserved as a senior telecom project coordinator with another employer from March 2009 \nuntil July 2019. A 1993 high school graduate, he attended a university for several years \nearning college credits, but no degree. He was initially granted a secret clearance in 2002, \nand it was renewed in 2009. Most of his accounts were discharged under a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in August 2019. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has a history of over-extending himself financially, \nliving an extravagant lifestyle by charging his travel, clothing, jewelry, and dining out on \nhis credit cards to the point where they became \u201cmaxed out.\u201d Between August 2015 and \nApril 2019, he took several international trips. At various times, he had a tax lien for unpaid \ntaxes; he owed federal income taxes; and he was behind on domestic support obligations \nto two women. He led the good life on credit, but ignored his accounts until such time that \nhe sought bankruptcy protection from his creditors. He was successful in 2010 and 2019, \nwhen most of his liabilities were discharged. In between those Chapter 7 discharges, he \ntactically filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 seven times, only to have those \nbankruptcies dismissed. His reason for filing under Chapter 13 was to help retain all of \nhis assets \u2013 house, cars, boat and other assets \u2013 that belonged to him. His reason for \nfiling under Chapter 7 was to remove the debts and give himself a fresh start to rebuild \nand reestablish good credit. He made no assertions, and offered no documentation, to \nsupport any conclusion that the Chapter 13 Trustees had completed a payment plan, \nreceived funds from Applicant, or made any payments to any creditors. There were no \nassertions by Applicant that he had paid the Trustees any funds. Because of his repeated \ndalliance with bankruptcy, rather than actually making efforts to pay his debts, there are \nlingering questions and continuing doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 20, 2021. \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of certain facts \nconcerning Russia and the United States\u2019 relationship with Russia.

ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) (\u201cDecisions in \nGuideline B cases should be made to the greatest extent possible in the context of \ncurrent political conditions in the country at issue.\u201d) \nJurisdiction \nApplicant is employed by a U.S. government contractor. The cabinet department \nthat oversees the federal agency where Applicant works has an agreement with DOD \nestablishing DOHA jurisdiction over the case. See Directive 5200.6 at \u00b6 2.2. (Tr. 12-14) \nFindings of Fact \nThrough his explanations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b \n(in part), 1.c, 1.d, 1.e (in part), and 1.f. The portions of the allegations that Applicant did \nnot clearly admit, I consider that he denied. In answering the Amendment to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c, again with explanations. \nHis admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 63 years old. Both he and his wife were born, raised, and educated \nin the former Soviet Union, in a Siberian city, in what is now Russia. They married in \n1979. (GE 1 at 26) Applicant earned a master\u2019s degree in 1980 (age 22) and a \ndoctorate in 1983 (age 25) at a prestigious university or academic institution in Siberia. \n(GE 1 at 13; Tr. 36-37, 40, 76-77) He has published three books in his field and many \nprofessional and scientific articles. Three times, he was named the best scientist at the \nSiberian academy or institute where he worked until coming to the United States. (Tr. \n36-37) \nApplicant and his wife have three grown children (and another son, who is \ndeceased). (Tr. 93) Applicant and his family came to the United States in 1999 when he \nwas granted entry under an H1B Visa. (Tr. 79-80) Applicant became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in August 2008. (GE 1 at 10) \nFrom 2005 to 2011, Applicant worked for a large defense contractor as a senior \nsoftware engineer. He worked for most of 2012 with a large insurance company. From \n2013 to early 2016, he was employed by federal contractors. (GE 1 at 18-21) Between \nearly 2016 and mid-2018, he worked either for federal contractors or independently as a \nconsultant. Since July 2018, he has worked as a cyber-security specialist or software \ndeveloper for a federal contractor.

He was also granted a secret \nclearance in October 2016 for similar work with another government agency. (GE 1 at \n55; 2 at 11; Tr. 14, 19, 49, 72) \nApplicant and his wife own their home in the United States. (AE B, AE C) He has \na six-figure annual salary and a net worth estimated in the mid-six figures. (Tr. 75-76, \n120-121; GE 2 at 8. In Russia, Applicant\u2019s wife worked as a geophysicist. As such, like \nApplicant, she was a government employee. She is now a housewife and grandmother. \n(GE 2 at 13; Tr. 91-92, 164-165) \n \nApplicant and his wife are both dual U.S.-Russian citizens. (GE 1 at 25, GE 2 at \n13) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f) They both hold valid Russian passports. (GE 2 at 13) He declared \non his SCA that \u201cI want to remain Russian.\u201d (GE 1 at 9) In his background interviews \nand in his hearing testimony, he stated that he declined to relinquish his Russian \ncitizenship because it is extremely difficult to do so, and because keeping a Russian \npassport allows for easier travel to Russia without the need for a visa. (GE 2 at 13, 15; \nTr. 32-36) His parents and a son are buried in Russia, and he wants to be able to visit \ntheir gravesites. (GE 2 at 12; Tr. 195) \nApplicant testified that he uses a Russian passport only to enter Russia. He uses \nhis U.S. passport when he exits Russia. When entering and exiting the United States, \nhe said he shows both passports so as to be fully transparent with U.S. authorities. He \nanticipates that he will renew his Russian passport when it expires in 2025. (Tr. 35, 116-\n117)  \nApplicant noted in his background interview that he has dual loyalty and \nallegiance, to both Russia and the United States. (GE 2 at 13) He said if the United \nStates and Russia were to enter into conflict, he would not fight for either side. (GE 2 at \n17) He later said if there were a conflict, he would fight against the people causing the \nconflict, no matter who they were. He said he feels allegiance to both countries, and \nalso said he has no preference for either the U.S. or the Russian government. (GE 2 at \n18) This \u201cdual allegiance\u201d is alleged in the SOR as a personal conduct security concern. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nApplicant testified that he participated in compulsory military training while in \nuniversity, but never served in either the Soviet or Russian military. (Tr. 77) When he \nworked in Russia as a mathematician and scientist, he was considered a government \nemployee. (Tr. 78) (Later in his testimony, he disputed that the academy where he \nworked was a government institution; he said it was \u201cindependent.\u201d) (Tr. 195) He was \nnever involved in political organizations or the Communist Party. \u201cAll my heart is here,\u201d \nhe said. All of his family are in the U.S. but for his father-in-law. (Tr. 33, 67) He \nreiterated these sentiments in closing, and said he would never \u201cbe a spy against [his] \ngrandkids\u201d from here (the United States. (Tr. 194-195) He is proud of his professional \nrecognition in Russia, but he said, \u201cI came here to make this country better.\u201d (Tr. 195) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s three grown children, all born in the 1980s, now live in the U.S., near \nApplicant and his wife, and are all naturalized U.S. citizens. (GE 1 at 28-31; GE 2 at 13; \nTr. 66) One son is an engineer; another son works in investments; and their daughter is \na housewife, married to an American. Their daughter has two young children, both born \nin the United States. (Tr. 65-67, 93, GE 2 at 16) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that all three of Applicant\u2019s children are dual U.S.-Russian \ncitizens. In his SOR Answer, Applicant said only his daughter is a dual citizen. His two \nsons have lived in the U.S. for 20 years, have not had active Russian passports since \n2012, and have not travelled to Russia for several years before then. (Answer; Tr. 65). \nHis daughter travelled to Russia once for medical treatment a few years ago. (Tr. 66) \nThere is no indication that Applicant\u2019s two sons have renounced their Russian \ncitizenship (something which Applicant testified is very difficult to do). \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased, as is his mother-in-law. (GE 1 at 27-28, 33) He \nhas one sister, who lives in Germany. (Tr. 108, GE 2 at 6) \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, age 89, is a citizen and resident of Russia. (Tr. 93) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) He is a retired scientist and engineer. As such, he was considered a \ngovernment employee. His father-in-law is blind, an invalid and has been in a nursing \nhome since June 2020. He was moved there with the help of a neighbor, A, and a \ndaughter from his second marriage. (GE 2 at 14-16; Tr. 96-97, 149, 166-168)) \nApplicant and his wife see her father in person when they visit Russia. (GE 1 at \n31-32; Tr. 95) He rarely speaks to his father-in-law by phone, but his wife speaks to her \nfather briefly about once a week. (GE 2 at 15; Tr. 95, 149-151) She is very close to her \nfather. She helped care for him and her brother after her mother died after a long illness \nwhen Applicant\u2019s wife was a teenager. (Tr. 151-152) Applicant\u2019s wife provides financial \nsupport to her father, as discussed below. His wife\u2019s father has four children from later \nmarriages. Applicant\u2019s wife has little contact with them because of the age difference. \n(Tr. 167-170) They are not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Russia. He lives in Siberia. \nHe is a scientist and Russian government employee. Applicant has no contact with him. \n(Tr. 109) He was not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant and his wife travelled to Russia for vacations and family visits in the \nsummers of 2009, 2015, 2017, and 2019. (GE 1 at 37, 46, 49; GE 2 at 9). Applicant has \nnot been back to Russia since July 2019. (Tr. 135) \nWhile studying and working at the institute in Siberia, Applicant and his family \nlived for several years in a dormitory. In about 1995, because of his excellent work, he \nwas allowed to move to a small, university-owned apartment. The apartment was only a \nfew hundred square feet.

They were granted ownership but \ncould not sell it. (Tr. 152-153; AE A) \nThey maintained ownership of the unit after they emigrated to the United States, \nand continue to own the unit now. The apartment is owned jointly by Applicant, his wife, \nand their children (not solely by his wife, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d). The alleged value of \nthe unit (about $30,000 US) is noted in the record (GE 2 at 12; Tr. 80) but the true value \nis not documented. Applicant and his wife have had renters in the past, and they used \nthe rental income (of about $250 a month, as alleged) to support Applicant\u2019s father. (GE \n2 at 13) The unit is currently vacant, because of the pandemic. (Answer; Tr. 68) They \nlast had renters about a year ago. (Tr. 81) Applicant had no direct contact with any \nrenters. (GE 2 at 17; Tr. 63-64, 81-82) \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that he may want to keep the \napartment and live there in retirement, in part, he said, because it is expensive to retire \nin the United States. (See GE 2 at 17-18) Applicant declined at hearing to confirm this \nas he made that statement during his background interview (though he adopted the \ninterview summaries in GE 2 as accurate without making changes). Regarding his \npresent intent, he testified that he has not decided where to retire. (Tr. 84-91) \nApplicant noted that he has to pay taxes and utilities (energy and water) for the \nRussian apartment \u201ceven if we don\u2019t use it.\u201d (Tr. 62-63) He said his wife is more \ninvolved with that process than he is. (Tr. 83-84) He also stated that he and his wife \nstay at the apartment when they visit Russia. (Tr. 80, 84, 112-116) Applicant \nacknowledged that he still owned the property, still used it, and was technically allowed \nto sell it. (Tr. 132) However, he said that selling the unit is difficult, as it would require all \nof the family members to travel to Russia, and his children do not want to do that. (Tr. \n37-42, 153-155) Applicant said the apartment is in disrepair. He would like to \u201cget rid of \nit.\u201d (Tr. 37-38) In a post-hearing letter, Applicant expressed a willingness to relinquish \nhis ownership of the apartment to his granddaughter. (AE H) \nBoth Applicant and his wife were born in 1958. When his wife turned 55 (in 2013) \nand when he turned 60 (in 2018), they both became eligible to receive a monthly \nfinancial benefit from the Russian government. She did not learn of her eligibility until \nlater. (Tr. 159-163) Applicant\u2019s wife said she has been receiving the benefit money for \nabout five years. (Tr. 175) \nThe amount of the benefits Applicant and his wife both receive is equivalent to \nabout $120 US per month (not $200 per month, as alleged). (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e) The \nbenefit is available to any Russian citizen and does not appear to be based on the fact \nthat both Applicant and his wife are former Russian government employees. At various \ntimes, Applicant described the benefit as a \u201cpension,\u201d (GE 2) and at other times he \ndisputed that term. (Tr. 60, 63) Regardless, the money seems to be the equivalent of a \nsocial security payment or benefit from the Russian government, available to Russian \ncitizens above a certain age. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife uses her monthly benefit to support her elderly father. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e) She uses the money for her father\u2019s medical care, which costs the equivalent of \nabout $500 US per month. (Tr. 46-47, 117) She noted that her father, being in his 80s, \nalso receives a financial benefit from the Russian government, and that money, too, is \nused for his nursing care.

A is a long-time, trusted acquaintance of the family. Applicant \nand his wife have given A authority to withdraw funds from his wife\u2019s Russian bank \naccount (like a power of attorney) for the father\u2019s care. A also manages Applicant\u2019s \napartment in Siberia and sees to it that the taxes and utility bills are paid. (Tr. 82-83, \n143-144, 172-173) Applicant has contact with A about once a year. However, Applicant \nand his wife are \u201cvery close\u201d to A. A is retired from a job as a technician at a Russian \nacademic institute. (Tr. 110-111) Other than A and his father-in-law, Applicant maintains \ncontact with no other Russian citizens. (Tr. 108) \nApplicant\u2019s $120 monthly benefit is deposited into an account at Russian Bank S \nset up for that purpose. (GE 2 at 7, 16) (SOR \u00b6 1.e) Applicant has never withdrawn the \nmoney, which accumulates in that account. (Tr. 45. 117, 159, AE E) He said that for him \nto do so, he would have to travel to Russia, which would cost more money than is in the \naccount. (Tr. 42-43, 80, 104) He said he was not contacted about the account, but it \nwas widely publicized in the media when the benefit system was established. (Tr. 105) \nHe has taken no active steps to close the Russian bank account or to renounce the \npension. (Tr. 105-107) After the hearing, Applicant provided a letter for the record \nindicating that the account contains the equivalent of $3,419 US. He is willing to \nrelinquish ownership of it and transfer it to his wife. (AE I) \nWhen he submitted his August 2018 SCA, Applicant did not disclose the \napartment in Russia, the Russian bank accounts, or the benefits he and his wife receive \nfrom the Russian government. These omissions are alleged as deliberate falsifications \nunder Guideline E (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c) \nSection 20A of Applicant\u2019s August 2018 SCA (Foreign Financial Interests \u2013 Real \nEstate) asks, \u201cHave you, your spouse, or legally recognized domestic civil \nunion/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children EVER owed, or do you \nanticipate owning, or plan to purchase real estate in a foreign country?\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 1 at 34) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that his wife owns \nan apartment in Russia and receives about $250 in monthly rental income from it (as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.b, asserting that he had answered the \nquestion correctly on his SCA because he was receiving no financial benefit or rent at \nthat time, and also because he was not able to sell it.

(Tr. 124-126) \nSection 20A of Applicant\u2019s August 2018 SCA (Foreign Financial Interests \u2013 \nForeign Benefit) asks, \u201cAs a U.S. citizen, have you, your spouse, or legally recognized \ndomestic civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children received in the \nlast seven (7) years, or are eligible to receive in the future, any educational, medical, \nretirement, social welfare, or other such benefit from a foreign country?\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE at 34) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that he and his \nwife receive monthly pensions from Russia (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) in answer to that \nquestion. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.c. He stated that, he learned during the family\u2019s \n2017 trip to Russia that he may be eligible for a pension (since he was soon to turn 60). \nHe went to the pension office but they were not able to provide confirmation. (Answer; \nTr. 99-103) In 2019, when they again visited Russia, Applicant learned that he was \neligible and that the equivalent of about $100 a month in benefits had been deposited \ninto an account at Russian bank S, beginning on May 15, 2018. However, he said he \ndid not know about the deposits when he prepared his SCA in August 2018, so his \nanswer was truthful. (Answer) (Tr. 50-61; AE E) Applicant testified that he learned from \nhis wife that she had money in her Russian account that she was using for her father. \nShe then suggested that he might have an account as well. (Tr. 141) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that Applicant was not aware that the money had been \ndeposited into the account until 2019, because \u201cwe had no connection to it.\u201d (Tr. 162) \nShe also said they went to the bank in 2017, before he turned 60. (Tr. 176) \nApplicant\u2019s first background interview occurred in November 2018. He reviewed \nhis SCA with the interviewing agent, and discussed his family members, including his \nfather-in-law, his employment history and his dual citizenship. He also discussed the \napartment in Russia, and the fact that his wife had used the rental income from the unit \nto support her father-in-law. There was no discussion of the issue of monthly benefits \nfrom the Russian government. (GE 2 at 11-13) \nApplicant testified that he did not learn about the bank account in Russia until \n2019. (Tr. 45, 117) He testified, \u201cI don\u2019t care about this pension,\u201d and \u201cI never saw these \nstatements before I arrived [in] Russia in August 2019.\u201d (Tr. 136-137, 141-142) He and \nhis wife travelled to Russia in July and August 2019. (GE 2 at 9) Yet he discussed the \nbank accounts and the financial benefits in his second background interview, which \noccurred in June 2019, before that trip. (GE 2 at 14) \nDuring that June 2019 interview, Applicant disclosed both his and his wife\u2019s \nRussian bank accounts, and the fact that they both received monthly benefits from the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRussian government. He also disclosed that his wife used her monthly benefits to \nsupport her father. (GE 2 at 16) He said in the interview that he did not list the accounts \nbecause of the small amounts of money involved. (GE 2 at 16) He testified that he did \nnot hide the apartment or the money that had accumulated in the accounts. (Tr. 140, \n142) He disclosed the assets during his interview when he was asked about them. (Tr. \n143) \nApplicant\u2019s discussion of the accounts and the benefits during his second \ninterview calls into question the veracity of his testimony and explanation in his Answer \nthat he learned of the accounts and the deposits during his 2019 trip to Russia \u2013 since \nthat trip occurred a month after his second background interview. (Tr. 128-131) At his \nhearing, Applicant acknowledged that he knew in 2017 that he might be eligible for such \nbenefits, when the pension office told him about them. (Tr. 127-128) \nSection 20 of Applicant\u2019s SCA also includes a question asking, \u201cHave you ever \nprovided financial support to any individual?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 1 at 34) \nApplicant explained during his testimony that his answer was truthful because it was his \nwife who provided financial support to her father, using her money. However, they also \nused money collected as rental income from their jointly owned apartment in Russia. He \nalso said it was possible that his wife supported her father using money Applicant had \nearned in the United States. (Tr. 133-135) Falsification of this question is not alleged in \nthe SOR. \nApplicant testified that he loves his job and his work and has provided value to \nhis federal agency. (Tr. 47-48) He testified that he is an honest man, not involved in \npolitics, doing good work that improves or provides value to his job. Loss of his job will \ndamage his family. He does not intend to switch jobs at his age, and expects to retire in \nthree to five years. (Tr. 69, 74) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that her husband is \u201cthe most hard-working person.\u201d He \nis very knowledgeable and effective at work. His company appreciates him and the help \nhe provides them. (Tr. 183-184) \nFive co-workers of Applicant\u2019s, including a supervisor, provided recommendation \nletters attesting to his character. He has excellent professional skills and is very \nknowledgeable. He is well respected and appreciated. He has an excellent work ethic. \nHe is mission-oriented, reliable, and responsible. (AE F) Two long-time personal friends \nof Applicant\u2019s provided reference letters. They both regard Applicant as reliable, \nresponsible, honest, and compassionate. (AE G) \nRussia \nThe Russian Federation has a highly centralized, authoritarian political system \ndominated by President Vladimir Putin. (AN Item I) The Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (ODNI) has determined that Russia is a highly capable and effective \nadversary, integrating ongoing cyber-espionage, attack, and influence operations to \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nachieve its political and military objectives.

(AN Item II) \nThe administrative notice filing and supporting documents detail numerous \nRussian intelligence operations in and against the United States since 2017 that have \nled to federal criminal indictments against Russian intelligence operatives. (AN Filing \nat4-7) \nIn its 2018 Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace Report, the National \nCounterintelligence and Security Center reported that Russia uses cyber operations as \nan instrument of intelligence collection to inform its decision-making and benefit its \neconomic interests, and that Russian intelligence services have conducted \nsophisticated and large-scale hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and \ntechnology information. (AN Item VII) \nThe ODNI has reported that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. \npresidential election demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, \nand scope of effort compared to previous operations. The ODNI assessed that Russia \nwould again attempt to influence the 2020 U.S. elections. Russia\u2019s persistent objective \nis to weaken the United States and diminish its global role. (AN Items IV and V) \nThe United States imposes sanctions on Russian persons and entities in \nresponse to Russian conduct, including its illegal annexation of Crimea, invasion of \neastern Ukraine, election interference, malicious cyber-enabled activities, and human \nrights abuses. (AN Item XX) \n \nAccording to the U.S. State Department\u2019s website, the State Department\u2019s \ncurrent Travel Advisory for Russia is Level 4: Do Not Travel, due to COVID-19 and \nrelated entry restrictions, terrorism, harassment by Russian government security \nofficials, the U.S. Embassy\u2019s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, and the \narbitrary enforcement of local law. The current travel advisory, dated November 2, 2021, \nis substantially similar to AN Item XXI, the State Department\u2019s Travel Advisory for \nRussia from August 2020.  \n \nU.S. citizens, including former and current U.S. government and military \npersonnel and private citizens engaged in business, who are visiting or residing in \nRussia have been interrogated without cause, threatened by Russian officials, and may \nbecome victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. All U.S. government \npersonnel should carefully consider their need to travel to Russia. (AN Item XXI) \nRussian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on spurious charges, \ndenied them fair and transparent treatment, and have convicted them in secret trials \nwithout presenting evidence. Russian officials may unreasonably delay U.S. consular \nassistance to detained U.S. citizens. Russian authorities arbitrarily enforce local laws \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nagainst U.S. citizen religious workers and open questionable criminal investigations \nagainst such individuals.

(AN Item XXI) \nRussia enforces special restrictions on dual U.S.-Russian nationals and may \nrefuse to acknowledge dual nationals\u2019 U.S. citizenship, including denying access to U.S. \nconsular assistance and preventing their departure from Russia. (AN Item XXI) \nTerrorist groups, transnational and local terrorist organizations, and individuals \ninspired by extremist ideology continue plotting possible attacks in Russia. Terrorists \nmay attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, \nmarkets, shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places \nof worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, \nand other public areas. (AN Item XXI) \nTelephone and electronic communications in Russia are subject to surveillance, \nwhich can potentially compromise sensitive information. The Russian System for \nOperational-Investigative Activities permits authorities to monitor and record all data \nlawfully that traverses Russia\u2019s networks. (AN Item XXIII) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nA heightened security risk is established by the administratively noticed facts \nabout Russia in the record. These include Russia\u2019s ongoing, persistent, pervasive \nattempts to target the United States, seeking to collect intelligence, erode democracy, \nundermine U.S. national policies and foreign relationships, and increase Russia\u2019s global \nposition and influence. A heightened risk is also established due to Russia\u2019s \nmistreatment and harassment of U.S. citizens, including former and current U.S. \ngovernment and military personnel and private citizens, the risk of electronic and other \nsurveillance, and human rights issues. \nBoth Applicant (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and his wife (SOR \u00b6 1.a) are dual U.S.-Russian \ncitizens, as are their three grown children (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The fact that they all live in the \nUnited States may limit the security risk, but AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) nonetheless apply. AG \n\u00b6 7(e) also applies to Applicant\u2019s wife, since she lives with Applicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) also apply to Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, who is a citizen and resident of Russia. \nApplicant and his wife, together with their children, maintain joint ownership of \nthe apartment in the Siberian city where they all used to live. Applicant and his wife \nhave received rental income from the unit in the past, but do not receive any currently. \nThey also maintain accounts at a Russian bank, through which they both receive \nmonthly benefits from the Russian government due to their age. (Though not alleged, \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law receives these benefits also). The monthly benefits, and the \npast rental income they received, both a few hundred dollars a month, are not \nparticularly substantial compared to their income and assets in the United States. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nHowever, given the strong heightened risk shown in the Administrative Notice \ndocuments about Russia and Russia\u2019s relationship with the United States, AG \u00b6 7(f) \nnonetheless applies.  \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant, his wife, and their three children are all dual citizens of the United \nStates and Russia. The nature of the Russian government, their active and pervasive \nintelligence-gathering efforts against the United States and against U.S. interests, and \nthe Russian government\u2019s relationship with, and treatment of, its own people (and \ncitizens of the United States), precludes application of AG \u00b6 8(a). On the basis of the \nadministrative notice materials, there is strong evidence that Applicant may be placed in \nposition where he may be forced to choose between U.S. and Russian interests, and a \nheightened risk of the potential of exploitation, duress or coercion is shown. \n \nFurther, Applicant specifically stated during his background interview that he has \ndual loyalty and allegiance, to both Russia and the United States. (GE 2 at 13) He said \nhe feels allegiance to both countries, and also said he has no preference for either the \nU.S. or the Russian government. (GE 2 at 18)  \nAs discussed under Guideline E below, this \u201cdual allegiance\u201d is alleged in the \nSOR as a personal conduct security concern. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) But it really goes to the heart \nof the Guideline B concern, since such a statement places Applicant\u2019s allegiances at \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissue by definition. For AG \u00b6 8(a) to apply, it must be \u201cunlikely [that] the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Applicant, through \nthese statements, is already there. \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s elderly father-in-law remains in Russia. Understandably, \nApplicant\u2019s wife feels a strong bond of affection for him, and she acts upon it through \nher efforts to support his medical care. Moreover, Applicant, his wife, and her father, all \nderive benefits from the Russian government through their Russian bank accounts. \nApplicant\u2019s wife depends upon her government benefits to support her father. The \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nremains, and AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. \nApplicant, his wife, and their three grown children have lived in the United States \nfor over 20 years. They have all established their lives here. AG \u00b6 8(b) therefore has \nsome application. But again, Applicant maintains strong ties to Russia through his, and \nhis family members\u2019 dual citizenship, his maintenance of an apartment there, as well as \nbank accounts and ongoing receipt of Russian government benefits. It cannot be said \nthat Applicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest\u201d as AG \u00b6 8(b) requires. Given his actions, his ongoing connections to Russia, \nand his stated sentiments, AG \u00b6 8(b) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. The contact and communication Applicant and his wife \nmaintain with her father-in-law, which includes financial support for his nursing home \ncare, preclude a finding that their relationship is \u201cso casual or infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d This is true \neven if it is Applicant\u2019s wife that has the primary bond with her father, not Applicant \nhimself. \nApplicant and his wife maintain accounts at a Russian bank, through which they \nboth receive monthly benefits from the Russian government. Those benefits, akin to \nU.S. social security payments, have little financial value, especially compared to \nApplicant\u2019s significant U.S. assets, which include a home valued in the mid-six figures, \nand a six-figure income. They continue to own their apartment in Russia. Its value is \nunclear, but it\u2019s small size (about 300 square feet, or less) does not suggest a high \nmonetary value. AG \u00b6 8(f) therefore has some application, when the family\u2019s Russian \nfinancial assets are balanced against their more significant assets in the United States. \nHowever, the fact that they maintain financial assets in Russia, and use those assets \n(his wife\u2019s benefits, at least) to provide support for her father-in-law, means those assets \nare not insignificant to them, no matter their comparison to their domestic U.S. financial \nassets. Further, the fact that they have ongoing financial connections to the Russian \ngovernment simply cannot be ignored as an avenue of potential exertion of influence, \nmanipulation, or pressure upon them by Russian authorities. AG \u00b6 8(f) therefore does \nnot apply.  \n \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGiven his ongoing family and financial connections to Russia and its government, \nApplicant has not met his heavy burden of persuasion of establishing that the foreign \ninfluence security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about an individual\u2019s personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to \nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with medical or \npsychological evaluation, or polygraph examination, if authorized \nand required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a reads: \u201cYou have a dual allegiance between the U.S. and Russia.\u201d \nApplicant admitted the allegation, with an explanation. This dual allegiance was alleged \nunder Guideline E (personal conduct) and not Guideline B (foreign influence). \nDuring closing argument, Department Counsel argued for application of either \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d), or both, under the theory that Applicant\u2019s dual allegiance constituted \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline, but \nwhich is nonetheless disqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the Guideline B \nsecurity concern is focused on an applicant\u2019s potential to be subjected to possible \nforeign influence through their connections to a foreign country (such as family \nmembers or financial interests), and not through an applicant\u2019s own sentiments, so the \ncase is best made under Guideline E instead. (Tr. 186-187, 191-193) \n17 \n  \nHowever, the first sentence of the general concern of Guideline B specifically \nrefers to divided allegiance: \u201cForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) (Emphasis added). I conclude that this specific \nreference to \u201cdivided allegiance\u201d under Guideline B precludes a finding that such a \nsentiment, even if established, constitutes disqualifying conduct under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) or \n16(d), precisely because it is \u201cexplicitly covered\u201d under Guideline B. Therefore, SOR \u00b6 \n2.a is found for Applicant. However, whether alleged under Guideline B or not, \nApplicant\u2019s dual allegiances are sufficiently established in the record, not only because \nof his own interview statements, but also because of his family and financial \nconnections to Russia, as fully addressed under Guideline B, above. \n    \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis leaves the two falsification allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c, both of which \nApplicant denied with explanations. This puts the burden on the government to establish \nthe allegations of deliberate falsification. \nIn considering whether Applicant deliberately failed to disclose either the monthly \nbenefits (to himself and his wife) or the apartment in Russia, I must weigh several \nfactors, including the language of the questions, Applicant\u2019s education level and life \nexperience, the fact that English is not his first language, and Applicant\u2019s credibility. \nSection 20A of Applicant\u2019s August 2018 SCA (Foreign Financial Interests \u2013 Real \nEstate) asks \u201cHave you, your spouse, or legally recognized domestic civil \nunion/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children EVER owed, or do you \nanticipate owning, or plan to purchase real estate in a foreign country?\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 1 at 34) \nThere is no question that Applicant and his wife and family owned an apartment \nin Russia at the time, and had owned an apartment there for many years. They had \nbeen granted a right to live in the apartment when they were still in Russia, and were \ngranted ownership through the privatization process in the mid-1990s. They maintained \nownership of the unit after moving to the United States, and they stayed in the \napartment on visits back to Russia. \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.b, and asserted that he did not lie, and intended to be \ntruthful. He gave several explanations for his answer. He asserted that he \nmisunderstood the question because it was not stated clearly; because he focused on \nthe portion of the question asking about plans to purchase real estate in the future; he \nstated that he had answered the question correctly since he was receiving no financial \nbenefit or rent from the property at the time and was not able to sell it; and he asserted, \nincorrectly, that the question asked about property being used for \u201ccommercial \npurposes.\u201d I conclude that through these explanations, Applicant either rationalized his \nnegative answer after the fact, or came up with reasons at the time why he did have to \ndisclose it. The text of the question is clear, as is Applicant\u2019s long-term ownership of the \napartment in Russia. Applicant is also highly intelligent and sophisticated, though \nEnglish is not his native language. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies as to Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to disclose the apartment on his August 2018 SCA. \nSection 20A of Applicant\u2019s August 2018 SCA (Foreign Financial Interests \u2013 \nForeign Benefit) asks \u201cAs a U.S. citizen, have you, your spouse, or legally recognized \ndomestic civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children received in the \nlast seven (7) years, or are eligible to receive in the future, any educational, medical, \nretirement, social welfare, or other such benefit from a foreign country?\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.c \nalleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that he and his wife receive \n\u201cmonthly pensions from Russia.\u201d Applicant denied the allegation with an explanation. \nApplicant prepared his SCA in August 2018.

She testified that she began receiving her benefits several years later. It is \nnot clear when this happened, but it may have been after their 2017 trip to Russia. \nDuring that trip, Applicant and his wife went to the \u201cpension office\u201d (or government \nbenefit office) in Russia. Applicant said he was told that he might become eligible in the \nfuture (when he turned 60) but he was not given specific information. It is possible that \nthey both applied at that time, and that she began receiving her benefits soon \nthereafter, since she was already eligible. Further, she used her benefits to support her \nfather in Russia, and Applicant knew this.  \nApplicant\u2019s benefits began in May 2018, after he turned 60, though he may not \nhave known it in August 2018 when he prepared his SCA. He testified that he learned \nabout his monthly benefit payments during his 2019 summer trip to Russia. Yet that trip \noccurred after his second background interview when he discussed them with the \ninvestigating agent, in June 2019. This discrepancy about the timing of when he learned \nabout the benefits undercuts Applicant\u2019s credibility. At his hearing, Applicant \nacknowledged that he knew in 2017 that he might be eligible for such benefits, when the \npension office told him about them. He also said in the interview that he did not disclose \nthe benefits because of the small amount of money involved. \nBut the question here is whether Applicant deliberately failed to disclose either \nhis, or his wife\u2019s Russian benefits, in August 2018 on his SCA. While Applicant probably \nshould have known to at least report his wife\u2019s benefits, I cannot conclude that his \nfailure to disclose them was deliberate. It is also not clear that he knew that he was also \nwas receiving Russian benefits at that time. While based on what the Russian benefit \noffice told him in 2017, he likely knew that such benefits would soon come his way, I \ncannot conclude that his failure to disclose them was deliberate. As to SOR \u00b6 2.c, AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not established. \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case \ninclude: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nFalsification of a security clearance application, even once, is a serious matter, \nand not a minor one. AG \u00b6 17(c) therefore only partially applies. However, during his \nfirst background interview, Applicant disclosed the matter of the Russian apartment, \ntheir receipt of rental income, and his wife\u2019s use of that income to benefit her father in \nRussia. This is sufficient to apply AG \u00b6 17(a). SOR \u00b6 2.b, the only established Guideline \nE allegation, is therefore mitigated. \n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines, B and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable recommendations from friends and co-workers. \nApplicant\u2019s wife and three adult children are dual U.S.-Russian citizens, as is \nApplicant himself. His elderly father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Russia. Applicant \nand his family continue to own a small apartment in Russia. He and his wife have bank \naccounts in Russia through which they receive monthly benefits from the Russian \ngovernment. Applicant\u2019s wife uses her benefit to support her elderly father. These are all \nongoing foreign influence security concerns. \nI note that Applicant did have prior eligibility for both a position of public trust and \na security clearance. However, security clearances are not granted in perpetuity. \nCircumstances change, both for individuals and for nations. Even if Applicant had a \nsecurity clearance in the past, I cannot ignore the strong evidence of an ongoing, hostile \nrelationship between the United States and Russia, and the Russian government\u2019s \nrecent, and ongoing, intelligence efforts against the United States and its interests. \nGiven the strong heightened risk shown by the Russian government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States and with the Russian people, and Applicant\u2019s \nongoing connections to both Russia and the Russian government, he did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B. \nWhile the personal conduct allegations under Guideline E are either mitigated or not \nestablished.

The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on September 22, 2020, detailing national \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non March 16, 2021. (Tr. at 38-39.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer to both of the SOR \nallegations, her testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. She has two adult children, ages 33 and 23. She was \nmarried for 21 years and divorced in 2006. She lives with her youngest child, who is a \nstudent and works part time. Applicant has a high school diploma and has taken some \ncollege courses in nursing. (Tr. at 15-16, 21.) \nApplicant works as a senior administrative associate for a DoD contractor. She has \nworked for this contractor for about 35 years. She presently earns about $50,000 per \nyear. She is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. She works in the training \ndepartment of her employer. The company\u2019s Project Management was obliged to have \none employee at her location obtain a security clearance to process security clearance \ntraining classes. Applicant was requested to apply. She reluctantly agreed and submitted \nher SCA knowing that she had two unresolved financial delinquencies. (Tr. at 17-19, 25.) \nIn October 2017, Applicant defaulted on the payment of two credit cards with a \ncombined indebtedness of about $38,000. She received and continues to receive spousal \nsupport of $303 per month. In 2017 and for a period before then, her expenses exceeded \nher income, which caused her to accumulate this credit-card debt. She got to a point \nwhere the cost of paying the debts exceeded her ability to pay the monthly payments. \nShe only has these two credit cards and one store charge card. At the same time as her \ndefault on the credit cards, she was diagnosed with cancer, resulting in some medical \nexpenses that were not fully covered by her employer-provided medical insurance. Her \ntreatment ended in December 2017, and she has been cancer-free for over three years. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe has ongoing medical expenses, however, to monitor her condition. (Tr. at 23-29, 35-\n36.) \nApplicant wanted to address her two outstanding debts by filing for bankruptcy. \nShe received advice that a bankruptcy filing would not be disqualifying for a security \nclearance, so she proceeded to begin the process with a bankruptcy attorney. She paid \nthe necessary legal fees and filled out the paperwork, but then stopped due to her cancer \ndiagnosis. She restarted the process three months ago, but nothing happened and she \nmust start over again. (Tr. at 20-21, 23-25, 32-34.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that since her divorce in 2006, she has \nstruggled to maintain a household as a single mother on a limited income and with only \nmodest help from her former husband. Paying her rent and other necessities required her \nto go into debt on her credit cards. At the hearing, she was unable to explain in detail \nwhat expenses she incurred. She has never prepared a budget, except in connection with \nher bankruptcy preparation. She has never sought financial assistance to help her \nmanage her finances and debts. In 2010, she moved out of an expensive apartment and \nhas lived in a less expensive apartment since 2011. She owns a car, but does not have \na car loan. Repairing her car and insuring it has been expensive. She is planning to \nprepare her 2020 tax return soon, which is a necessary step prior to filing for bankruptcy. \nShe expects to owe $3,000 to $4,000 in taxes for 2020. She intends to pay her tax liability \nout of her 401k account, which has a balance of about $170,000. (Tr. at 24-28, 33-35, 37-\n38.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, Bank A Credit-Card Debt Charged Off in the Amount of $22,642. Applicant \nopened this account in November 2013. Her last payment was made in September 2017. \nThe debt has been charged off. Applicant has made no payments since 2017. This debt \nis not resolved. (GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, Bank B Credit-Card Debt Charged Off in the Amount of $15,256. Applicant \nopened this account in September 2003. Her last payment was made in September 2017. \nThe debt has been charged off. Applicant has made no payments since 2017. (GE 4 at \n2; GE 5 at 4.) This debt is not resolved. \nApplicant has a long and loyal history working for her employer. She loves her \nwork. She has bravely defeated cancer and has been cancer free for the past three years. \n(Tr. at 17, 19, 23, 29.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR Answer and testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts, and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Four of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has only two debts, but they are current and continue to cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She suffered a setback with \nher cancer diagnosis, and incurred expenses as a result, because not all of them were \ncovered by insurance. This was a circumstance beyond her control, so the first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. However, she has not since acted responsibly by addressing her \ndebts. She has not received any meaningful credit counseling and has not made any \ngood-faith efforts to resolve her debts. Instead she has made less than a fully committed \neffort to discharge her debts in bankruptcy, a recent and ongoing process. None of the \nabove mitigating conditions have been fully established. \nIn light of the record as a whole, Applicant failed to carry her burden to establish \nmitigation of the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the applicable \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher indebtedness. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2019. He is married after a previous divorce, and has two grown children, and one stepchild. (TR at page 19 line 8 to page 26 line 13.) Applicant attributes his admitted past-due indebtedness to his divorce. Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. Applicant admits a past-due, credit-card debt of about $53,000 that is directly related to his divorce. He is making monthly payments averaging about $150; and has paid a total of $5,950 towards this debt, as evidenced by documentation. (TR at page 26 line 14 to page 29 line 9, and AppX F.) I find a good-faith effort to satisfy this debt; and as such, this allegation is found for Applicant. 1.b. Applicant admits a past-due, credit-card debt of about $15,000 that is not related to his divorce. He has done nothing to address this debt, despite admitting the ability to do so.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 20, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 14, \n2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 25, 2021, scheduling the hearing for February 23, 2021. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 6, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered eight \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through H, and admitted into \nevidence.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since 2019. He is married after a previous \ndivorce, and has two grown children, and one stepchild. (TR at page 19 line 8 to page \n26 line 13.) Applicant attributes his admitted past-due indebtedness to his divorce. \n Guideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits a past-due, credit-card debt of about $53,000 that is directly \nrelated to his divorce. He is making monthly payments averaging about $150; and has \npaid a total of $5,950 towards this debt, as evidenced by documentation. (TR at page \n26 line 14 to page 29 line 9, and AppX F.) I find a good-faith effort to satisfy this debt; \nand as such, this allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admits a past-due, credit-card debt of about $15,000 that is not \nrelated to his divorce. He has done nothing to address this debt, despite admitting the \nability to do so. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admits an outstanding judgment, related to a credit-card debt, in \nthe amount of about $13,000. He has done nothing to address this debt. (TR at page 31 \nline 23 to page 34 line 7, at page 35 line 8 to page 36 line 14, and at page 37 lines \n7~18.)

(TR at page 34 line 8 to page 35 line 7.) This allegation is \nfound against Applicant.  \n \n \n1.e. and 1.f. Applicant has two judgments in favor of Creditor E in amounts of \n$4,872 and $2,416, respectively. One judgment has been satisfied, and Applicant is \nmaking monthly payments of $300 towards the other, as supported by documentation. \n(TR at page 35 line 8 to page 37 line 18, and AppXs E and K.)  I find a good-faith effort \nto satisfy these debts; and as such, these allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admits a past-due, credit-card debt of about $598. He has done \nnothing to address this debt. (TR at page 37 line 19 to page 38 line 5.) This allegation is \nfound against Applicant. \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n1.h.

Applicant admits a past-due, medical debt of about $686. He avers he has\n\u201cpaid\u201d this, but has submitted nothing in support of his averment. (TR at page 40 lines\n3~22.) This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n1.j. Applicant admits that Bank J appears to have charged-off a delinquent credit-\ncard debt in the amount of about $700. (TR at page 40 line 23 to page 41 line 18.) This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.k. Applicant admits a past-due, medical debt of about $40. He avers he has \n\u201cpaid\u201d this, but has submitted nothing in support of his averment. (TR at page 40 line 19 \nto page 42 line 13.) This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.l. Applicant admits he owed delinquent Federal income taxes for tax year 2017 \nin the amount of about $22,000, and that he has yet to address this delinquency. (TR at \npage 46 line 21 to page 51 line 15, and AppXs D and I.) This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.m.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness and past-due taxes. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his financial difficulties to a divorce; and he is \nadmittedly in a more stable financial situation, his financial problems are ongoing. He \nhas yet to address most of his delinquencies. Furthermore, Applicant has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is well respected in his community \nand in the workplace. (AppXs A~C.) However, overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b~1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.g~1.l: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old and has worked for a defense contractor as an assembler since August 2018. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2007. He has two adult children, ages 29 and 32. He earned a high school diploma and has taken some college and technical school courses. (Tr. at 29.) From 2007 until 2018, Applicant was self-employed as a delivery driver contractor, driving hundreds of miles every day. He lost his delivery contract twice, once in 2010 and again in 2015 or 2016. From about 2016 to 2018, he was unemployed and experienced serious financial difficulties. Since becoming employed full time as a W-2 employee, he has been able to stabilize his financial situation. He also works part time in another field as a 1099 employee to make a little extra income. He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. (Tr. at 31-37, 49-50, 68-69.)

Applicant offered \nthree exhibits at the hearing, which I marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. His \nexhibits were also admitted without objection. (Hearing Transcript at 15-23.) \nI kept the record open until August 24, 2021, to give Applicant the opportunity to \nsupplement the record. He timely submitted three additional documents, which I marked \nas AE D through F and admitted into the record without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on August 16, 2021. (Tr. at 73.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old and has worked for a defense contractor as an assembler \nsince August 2018. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2007. He has two adult children, \nages 29 and 32. He earned a high school diploma and has taken some college and \ntechnical school courses. (Tr. at 29.) \nFrom 2007 until 2018, Applicant was self-employed as a delivery driver contractor, \ndriving hundreds of miles every day. He lost his delivery contract twice, once in 2010 and \nagain in 2015 or 2016. From about 2016 to 2018, he was unemployed and experienced \nserious financial difficulties. Since becoming employed full time as a W-2 employee, he \nhas been able to stabilize his financial situation. He also works part time in another field \nas a 1099 employee to make a little extra income. He is a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance. (Tr. at 31-37, 49-50, 68-69.) \nSOR Allegations \nParagraph 1, Guideline F - The SOR sets forth seven allegations regarding \nApplicant\u2019s failures to pay his federal tax liabilities, one delinquent education loan, and \nfive past-due consumer debts.

In his Answer, Applicant denied this allegation and wrote that he paid off \nthe tax debts for the years 2012-2016 through a payment plan ending in November 2018. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided an IRS Account Summary, dated August 16, 2021, \nreflecting a zero balance on his taxes for TYs 2011-2020. These tax debts have been \nresolved. (Answer; AE F.) \n1.b Car loan charged off in the amount of about $5,937 \u2013 Applicant denied this \ndebt in his Answer. He wrote that the lender involuntarily repossessed his car and resold \nit. He disputes the amount the lender claims is owed. He testified that this amount is what \nhe owed the lender when it repossessed the car in 2015 after he defaulted on paying the \nloan. He argues that he should only owe the loan balance after the resale of the car. This \naccount was opened in 2010, and he paid the loan for about five years. He tried to settle \nthe debt with an installment payment plan, but the lender refused. The lender would only \naccept a lump-sum payment of the debt, which Applicant could not afford. Applicant \ndescribed the current status of this debt as in \u201climbo.\u201d This debt is not resolved. (Answer; \nTr. at 38-41; GE 4 at 1-2; GE 5 at 4.) \n1.c Collection account in the amount of about  $3,320 \u2013 Applicant denied this \ndebt in his Answer. He wrote that he attempted to enter into a payment plan with the \ncollection agency, but his offer was rejected. The creditor insists on a lump-sum payment \nin full. The debt is a \u201cpay-day\u201d loan, which Applicant opened in 2016 in the amount of \n$3,400 during his period of \u201chardship\u201d without a contract, and he could not afford to repay \nthe loan. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not believe he had made any \npayments on this debt. He was mistaken at that time. One of his post-hearing exhibits \nlists payments in a total amount of $1,501, or almost one-half of this debt. This debt is \npartially resolved. (Answer; Tr. at 41-44; AE D; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4.) \n1.d Education loan in default in the amount of about $2,228 \u2013 This loan was \nopened in about 2010, and Applicant defaulted on its repayment in about 2014. In his \nAnswer, Applicant denied this debt. He wrote that the loan was for his daughter\u2019s \neducation in a technical school. She never was able to graduate because of fraud on the \npart of the school. He wrote further that his daughter has been advised that neither she \nnor Applicant as the co-signer on the loan have to repay this student loan because of the \nschool\u2019s fraud. He believes that the school was sued for fraud and the settlement relieved \nall students with education loans paid to the school of any responsibility to repay the \nloans, even if the loans had been assigned to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) \nfor collection. Applicant has no documentation to support his understanding on the current \nstatus of this loan. His child is presently homeless and has no documentation regarding \nthe loan. The debt remains on Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report in the record, dated \nMarch 11, 2021. This debt is not resolved.

Applicant defaulted on the monthly payments in about 2015 \nor 2016. In his Answer, Applicant denied the debt and wrote that he contacted the creditor \nand offered to repay the debt in installments. He was refused because the creditor insisted \non being paid one-lump sum.The creditor was willing to accept a lump-sum payment for \nless than the full amount, but Applicant could not afford to pay the reduced amount. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Answer; Tr. at 48-50; GE 4 at 2.) \n1.f Charged-off account in the amount of about $444 \u2013 Applicant admitted this \ndebt in his Answer and commented that he has been unable to repay this debt due to his \nlimited income. This account is another \u201cpay-day\u201d loan. In October 2015, Applicant \nborrowed $600 to pay for his living expenses when he was unemployed. AE A lists six \npayments totaling about $1,690. Most of these payments were for interest or other \ncharges and were made in 2015 and 2016. Applicant still has a balance to pay. This debt \nis not resolved. (Answer; Tr at 50-57; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 5.) \n1.g Collection account in the amount of about $559 \u2013 Applicant opened this \naccount with an internet/cable TV provider. The creditor claims he did not return the \ncompany\u2019s equipment. He admitted the debt in his Answer and wrote that he has been \nunable to pay this debt due to his limited income. At the hearing, he testified that he had \nreturned the equipment when he moved and discontinued the service. He also testified \nthat the debt included the last month of service by the provider. He has not contacted the \ncreditor to settle this account. This debt is not resolved. (Answer; Tr at 57-59; GE 5 at 8.) \n1.h Failure to pay Federal taxes for TY 2019 in the amount of about $1,066 \u2013 \nApplicant admitted this debt in his Answer to Amendment and noted that he entered into \nan installment agreement with the IRS in October 2020 to pay this tax debt. He submitted \na document with his 2019 IRS statement, reflecting a balance of $333.14 for TY 2019. \nApplicant has also filed his 2020 federal tax return, and his TY 2020 tax is fully paid. As \nnoted above, he submitted after the hearing an updated IRS Account Summary, which \nreflects that he has a zero balance for TYs 2011-2020. Applicant has resolved his TY \n2019 tax debt. (Amendment to Answer at 1, 3-4; AE E; AE F.) \nApplicant\u2019s employer does not offer financial counseling to its employees, and \nApplicant has not received any counseling. He was raised in a \u201cfinancially-disabled home\u201d \nand has never had the opportunity to be educated in financial matters. He merely lives \npaycheck to paycheck. He has considered the possibility of working with debt-\nconsolidation or credit-repair companies. He has decided, however, that it would be better \nto try to make installment payment plans directly with his creditors. He wants to purchase \na home, and he knows he needs to fix his credit to be able to do that. He is afraid that if \nhe consolidates his debts or files for bankruptcy, he will not be able to qualify for a \nmortgage to buy a home. Even though he has some unresolved debts, he believes he is \nan honest person who tries to do the right thing. (Tr. at 50, 59-62, 74.) \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly take-home pay is about $2,800. He shares his living \nexpenses equally with his girlfriend/cohabitant. Their rent is $2,300.

(Tr. at 61-67.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence listing six delinquent consumer debts and two Federal \ntax debts establish the following conditions under AG \u00b6 19 that could be disqualifying: \n(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local. Income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Six of these mitigating conditions have possible \napplicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue; and  \n(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous and, for the most \npart, they remain unresolved. In the absence of a track record of actions taken to resolve \nhis debts, his behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose \nlargely due to his loss of income and unemployment in 2015 and 2016 when he lost his \ndelivery contract. His unemployment continued until he found new employment in 2018. \nHe acted responsibly by setting up a payment plan to pay his past-due Federal taxes and \nhas resolved his tax delinquencies. He has not, however, acted responsibly with respect \nto his six other delinquent debts. Even if he is correct that his creditors would not allow \nhim to repay his debts in monthly installments, he could have acted responsibly by paying \neach debt in sequence with monthly savings and a lump-sum payment He did not act \nresponsibly by failing to repay any of these debts over the last three years. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought any financial counseling. \nHe was able to resolve his federal tax debts on his own because he was able to file his \ntax returns and to set up installment payment plans with help from the IRS and its self-\nhelp technology. The same was not true with his consumer debts. Given his lack of \ntraining in financial matters when he was young, he needed professional help to assist \nhim in navigating the difficult waters of pay-day loans as well as post-repossession car \nloans and student loans that are in dispute. He was stymied into non-action when told he \nhad to make lump-sum payments to resolve debts. He needed counseling to help him \nresolve these debts and he did not seek it. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially established. Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay his delinquent federal taxes and has fully paid all of his past-due taxes up until TY \n2020. He has also made payments on the pay-day loan that is the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nHe has not otherwise made a good-faith effort to repay the other debts listed in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established.

He claims that there has been litigation involving the claim of fraud by the school, \nbut again he provided no details or documentation. His daughter\u2019s homelessness \npresents an obvious problem with respect to Applicant producing documentation about \nthese issues. However, he was a co-signer on the student loan and should have been \ncontacted about the litigation and any resolution. Also, he did not contact DOE to \ndetermine his obligations on the loan under the circumstances. He has not taken \nreasonable actions to try to resolve either the disputed car loan or the disputed student \nloan. \nAG 20(g) is established. Applicant has documented that he has paid all past-due \ntaxes in a reasonable and responsible manner. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s financial \nhardship while unemployed from 2015 or 2016 to 2018, and his lack of sophisticated \nfinancial training and skills to deal with the debts that arose during this period of hardship. \nI have also considered the positive steps he has taken to address his past-due taxes and \nthe difficulties he experienced trying to negotiate installment payment plans with his other \ncreditors. He has simply not taken sufficient positive steps, however, to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts, starting with seeking help from others \nwith more experience in financial matters and debt-resolution options. \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.g: \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate financial considerations concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information \nor to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 28, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

This case \nwas assigned to me on July 6, 2021. A hearing was scheduled for July 30, 2021, and \nheard on the date as scheduled through the Defense Collaborative System (DCS). At \nthe hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of six exhibits (GEs 1-5). Applicant relied \non no exhibits and one witness (herself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on August \n11, 2021. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with documentary evidence \nsupporting her payment efforts and looking into the engagement of a financial \ncounselor. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement the \nrecord. (Tr. 72-76) Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond. Within the \ntime permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with five post-hearing exhibits that \nwere admitted without objection as AEs A-E. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to file a federal income tax \nreturn (characterized in the SOR as an unemployment income tax return) for tax year \n2017, as required; (b) accumulated three delinquent student loans exceeding $8,800; \nand (c) accumulated 11 delinquent consumer loans exceeding $25,000. Allegedly, \nApplicant has neither filed her 2017 federal income tax return (unemployment income \ntax return) nor paid or resolved her listed delinquent student loan, medical, and \nconsumer debts. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations. She claimed unawareness of owing any taxes. She claimed she is paying \non her student loan accounts. She claimed to have fallen behind on a number of her \nlisted SOR-debts and has since taken care of a number of the listed accounts. SOR-\ndebts \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h. She further claimed a lack of awareness of the debt covered by \nSOR \u00b6 1.j. And, she claimed the vehicle covered by SOR \u00b61.k got too old and \ntroublesome to hold onto, and she let it go before purchasing another vehicle. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 34-year-old senior administrative assistant for a defense contractor \nwho seeks a security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted \nas relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in 2009 and has two children, one from this marriage and \nanother from a prior relationship.

(GE \n1) Between October 2016 and November 2018, she was employed by a non-defense \ncontractor as a senior administrative assistant. (GE 1; Tr. 40-41) She reported \nunemployment for a brief six-month period in 2016. (GE 1) She has never possessed a \nsecurity clearance.  (GE 1)   \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2013 and 2019, Applicant accumulated three delinquent student loan \ndebts exceeding $8,800 and delinquent medical and consumer debts exceeding \n$25,000. (GEs 2-5) In her post-hearing submissions (AEs B-C) she supplied a payment \nhistory of small payments made toward her matured student loans. Because these \nsmall payments were not considered by her student loan lender, the Department of \nEducation (DoE) to prevent her loans from being in default, they were placed in a DoE \ndefault category. (AE C) \nAfter crediting two voluntary payments (of $181 each) made in March 2019 and \nMay 2019, respectively, and a U.S. Treasury offset from Applicant\u2019s tax refund \nentitlement (in the amount of $838) made in February 2019 to Applicant\u2019s student loan \narrearage, the DoE was able to move Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loan accounts over \nto the lender\u2019s rehabilitation category. (AE C) Further payment progress by Applicant on \nher student loan obligations is unclear. Since her last reported payments on her student \nloans in 2019, she hasn\u2019t provided any payment updates. \nBesides her delinquent student loans, Applicant accumulated number of \ndelinquent medical and consumer debts (11 in all, exceeding $25,000). (GEs 2-6) To \ndate, she has provided no documentation of her addressing any of these accounts with \npayments, payment plans, or successful disputing of any of the listed SOR debts. \nAfforded additional post-hearing opportunities to document her payment and resolution \nefforts, Applicant failed to do so. While six of the listed debts in the SOR have since \nbeen removed from her credit reports (e.g., SOR debts covered by \u00b6\u00b61.f-1.j), their \nremoval alone does not supply the needed proof of her resolving them by good-faith, \nvoluntary means. \nAllegations that Applicant failed to file, as required, an federal income \n(unemployment income) tax return for tax year 2017 are successfully challenged by \nApplicant. The pertinent tax year for reporting her unemployment income was 2016, and \nnot 2017, based on the unemployment information she provided in her electronic \nquestionnaires for investigations processing (e-QIP) Applicant documented her filing her \n2016 federal tax return in March 2017, as required. Applicant, in turn, was credited by \nthe IRS with reporting her 2016 unemployment income for that year in her filed federal \nincome tax return. (AE B) State income tax returns are not required in her state of \nresidence. (Tr.. 69-70) \nAddressing her financial resources currently available to her, Applicant earns \n$52,000 annually and nets $700 bi-weekly.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThe guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must be considered before \ndeciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. \nAlthough, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the \nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a \ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is  \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying \nconditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for financial considerations apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create  \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 19-\n02593 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, \n2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information. While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \n \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23, 2016; ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with her delinquent student loan, medical, and \nconsumer debts raises considerable concerns over her ability to manage her finances in \na responsible and reliable way.  \nExtenuating circumstances associated with brief unemployment in 2016 appear \nto have played some role in Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations.

The \nvoluntary payments she made to the DoE in 2019 to help change her payment status \nfrom default to rehabilitation, while helpful, were overshadowed by the more substantial \ninvoluntarily applied Treasury funds the DoE used to change her student loan default \nstatus to a rehabilitation category. With so little financial information to work with over \nthe course of the past five years, no meaningful extenuation credits can be assigned at \nthis time. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u2019 that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, she has failed to take sufficiently meaningful good-faith \nvoluntary initiatives steps to either pay off or establish credible payment plans to \naddress her delinquent medical and consumer debts. \nDebts reduced through involuntary initiatives, such as creditor garnishments, \nattachments, and foreclosures, generally do not meet the mitigation requirements of \nMC) \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Neither the expiration of state statutes of \nlimitation, creditor attachments, nor removal of delinquent debts from creditor reports for \nreasons other payment satisfaction or successful dispute can be equated with good-\nfaith efforts to repay overdue creditors. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 (App. Bd. \nJuly 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-3030 at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004 (quoting ISCR case No. \n99-9020 at 5-6) App. Bd.

She has one \ngrown child. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. She has been employed by a \nfederal contractor since 2018. Prior to then she was consistently employed since 2007. \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately $39,533. In her \nanswer to the SOR, she indicated her financial problems began in 2015 when she \nexperienced medical issues that resulted in surgery, followed by a separation and divorce. \nShe was then in an unpaid leave status from work for nine months. (Item 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2018 security clearance application (SCA), she disclosed \nthat she had four credit card debts that were suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed. She explained in her SCA that due to medical issues she was \nunable to pay all of her bills and used credit cards to supplement her income and pay for \nessentials. She made minimum payments on the credit cards until she was unable to do \nso. She said she had initiated payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a and will pay each \ndebt one at a time. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the two debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($8,061) and 1.b ($6,764). \nIn October 2018 Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part \nof her background investigation. She confirmed that she owed the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b and 1.d. (SOR \u00b6 1.d is the collector for the original credit card debt, which she \ndisclosed in her SCA.) She told the investigator that she was repaying these debts \nthrough a debt rehabilitation program (DRP), whereby she pays $447 per month, and the \nDRP negotiates the amounts to be paid to each creditor. Along with the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, she stated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h were included in the \nDRP repayment plan. She said she was unaware of how much is paid to each creditor \nuntil a final settlement is reached. Applicant did not provide evidence of her agreement \nor payments made to the DRP. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR, Applicant admitted she owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b, and she explained that in mid-2017 she contacted these creditors when she \ncould not make payments on the accounts and requested the accounts be closed. Two \nyears later she contacted them again and she said she was told the debts were charged \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant told the investigator that she was unaware of some of her delinquent \ndebts until she was notified by the DRP after she completed her SCA. She acknowledged \nto the investigator the collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($1,979) and 1.h ($1,277), which \nwere included in her DRP repayment plan. She stated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b ($6,764) and 1.e ($2,956) with the same creditor are the same account. They have \ntwo different account numbers and two different balances owed. Applicant separately \nacknowledged both debts during her interview with the government investigator. She \nprovided no evidence that they are the same account. Regarding the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.c, she stated in her SOR answer that she had no recollection of these accounts, \nbut there is a possibility they were opened by her alone or as a joint account when she \nwas married. Her February 2020 credit report notes that the account in SOR \u00b6 1.c was \n\u201cclosed at consumer\u2019s request: charged off account.\u201d Applicant did not provide evidence \nthat she has resolved any of these accounts.

She said she was told she no longer owed the debts. This contradicts her statement \nto a government investigator that the debts were included in a repayment plan with the \nDRP and she was making payments. The debts are not resolved. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR she denied the collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j and 1.k. The original creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the account Applicant \ndisclosed in her SCA. She disclosed the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h during her \nbackground interview. Applicant told the government investigator the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.f and 1.h were included in her repayment plan with the DRP. \nApplicant provided a court document in her SOR answer, showing that a case with \nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.k was dismissed without prejudice. She did not provide \nspecific information as to which account this may apply or information about the other \naccount. These debts were reported in her 2019 credit report, but not her 2020 credit \nreport. They are resolved in her favor. \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i stating she had paid the account. Her 2019 \nand 2020 credit reports indicate it is in a delinquent status. She failed to provide evidence \nthat the account has been paid. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR she provided copies of dispute letters from \nDecember 2019 that she sent to the collection creditors. She also provided copies of \ndispute letters from February 2019 to the credit bureaus requesting validation of the \ndebts. (In her February 2019 letters to the credit bureaus she references her December \n2019 letters. It appears she may have the wrong date on the credit bureau letters.) She \nindicated they did not respond. However, the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k were \nremoved from the 2020 credit report. Notations in that credit report for the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g state: \u201cconsumer disputes after resolution.\u201d The notations for the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h state: \u201cconsumer disputes this account information.\u201d These are \naccounts Applicant disclosed she owed in her statement to the government investigator. \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h and 1.i \nbelong to Applicant and are valid. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts totaling approximately $31,103 that \nbegan accumulating in about 2016. There is sufficient evidence to support the application \nof the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to her 2015 divorce and subsequent \nmedical issues that caused her to be in an unpaid work status for nine months. She used \ncredit cards to pay for her necessities during this time. She paid them until she was \nunable, and they became delinquent. These were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control. \nFor the application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. She disclosed some of her delinquent debts in her \nSCA and said she was paying one at a time. She acknowledged her delinquent debts to \nthe government investigator, including ones brought to her attention by the DRP and she \nsaid they were in a repayment plan. Later she disputed some of these debts. She has not \nprovided any documentary proof to show she has acted responsibly and that she has paid \nor resolved her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) marginally applies. \nApplicant\u2019s debts have been delinquent for many years. She did not take action to \ndispute the debts or resolve them until after she was put on notice in 2018 that her \nfinances raised security concerns. She then began disputing debts that she had \npreviously acknowledged belonged to her or that she had indicated were part of a \npayment plan with the DRP. She failed to provide evidence of this plan or any payments \nmade to it. I cannot find that she has participated in financial counseling. There are not \nclear indications that her financial problems are being resolved or under control. There is \nno evidence of a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or resolve her delinquent \ndebts. Her conduct casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant successfully disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k, and they were \nremoved from her 2020 credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to these debts. I find that despite \nher denials, there is sufficient evidence to conclude the remaining debts belong to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and she has failed to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to the remaining \ndebts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that she has failed to resolve. She failed \nto meet her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. 2 Applicant is 42 years old, divorced, and has two children, ages 14 and 21. He and his former wife were together since 1997, and they married in 2006. She left him suddenly in about 2017 and they divorced in August 2017. He provides monthly child support to his former wife. (Tr. at 8-9, 14-23.) Applicant graduated from high school in 1996 and earned an associate\u2019s degree in June 2004. He began working for a DoD contractor in January 2021 after being laid off by a different employer due to the Covid-19 pandemic in August 2020. He works as an aircraft structures mechanic and has worked in the aviation industry for over 15 years. He has experienced short periods of unemployment in 2010-2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019, in addition to his unemployment in 2020. He submitted his SCA in July 2019 in connection with a position as a machine mechanic. His current position requires a security clearance as did his immediate past employer, his original clearance sponsor. He has not held a clearance in the past. (Tr. at 8-9, 14-24.)

Based upon a review of the pleadings, the documentary evidence, \nand Applicant\u2019s testimony, national security eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 12, 2019, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA). The \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on September 24, 2020, \ndetailing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n1 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document (Answer). He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On January 21, 2021, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on February 16, 2021, scheduling the hearing for March 8, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented four \nproposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. The exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. I marked Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit \nI. During the hearing, Department Counsel offered an additional credit report, dated May \n5, 2020, which supports the SOR allegation in subparagraph 1.p. This debt only appears \nin this credit report, which was not previously provided to Applicant along with the \nGovernment\u2019s four other exhibits. I marked this credit report as GE 5 for identification \npurposes and gave Applicant time to review it. He objected to its admission into the record \nbecause he had never heard of the collection agency or the original creditor listed in the \ncredit report and alleged in subparagraph1.p of the SOR. Subject to Applicant\u2019s denial of \nthis debt and claim that the credit report is inaccurate, I admitted GE 5 into the record. \nApplicant offered no exhibits. (Tr. 10-13, 46-50, 64-65.) \nAt the conclusion of the evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \nallegations 1.a and 1.b to add two tax years (TY) in which Applicant testified he had not \nyet filed his Federal or state tax returns, specifically TY 2018 and 2019. I granted the \nGovernment\u2019s motion and noted the amendment on the file copy of the SOR. (Tr. at 25-\n26, 67-68.) \nI granted Applicant time to give him the opportunity to submit any documentation \nhe believed would support his case. The initial deadline was March 22, 2021, but upon \nApplicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until April 14, 2021. On April 13, 2021, he \nsubmitted two documents, which were duplicates of the same document. I extended \nApplicant\u2019s time to April 15 to make a further submission in the event that he made a \nmistake attaching two copies of the same document to his email submission and had \nintended to submit a second document. He submitted nothing further and the record \nclosed on April 15, 2021. I marked his two documents as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and \nA2. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 15, 2021. Copies of the relevant \nemail correspondence regarding the post-hearing submission deadline have been \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit II. (Tr. at 67-68, 71-72.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, divorced, and has two children, ages 14 and 21. He and \nhis former wife were together since 1997, and they married in 2006. She left him suddenly \nin about 2017 and they divorced in August 2017. He provides monthly child support to his \nformer wife. (Tr. at 8-9, 14-23.) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1996 and earned an associate\u2019s degree \nin June 2004. He began working for a DoD contractor in January 2021 after being laid off \nby a different employer due to the Covid-19 pandemic in August 2020. He works as an \naircraft structures mechanic and has worked in the aviation industry for over 15 years. He \nhas experienced short periods of unemployment in 2010-2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, and \n2019, in addition to his unemployment in 2020. He submitted his SCA in July 2019 in \nconnection with a position as a machine mechanic. His current position requires a security \nclearance as did his immediate past employer, his original clearance sponsor. He has not \nheld a clearance in the past. (Tr. at 8-9, 14-24.) \nDue to his divorce and several recent periods of unemployment, Applicant has \nincurred a number of debts he could not pay. He also experienced difficulties filing his \nFederal and state tax returns. The SOR identifies Applicant\u2019s tax filing deficiencies and \ndelinquent debts and also alleges that he failed to disclose 13 of his debts in his SCA. \n(Tr. at 18-19, 30.) \nSOR Allegations \n1. Under Guideline F, the SOR, as amended, sets forth 19 allegations. In his \nAnswer, Applicant denied or disputed most of the debts, while admitting he had unfiled \ntax returns. The details surrounding each allegation are the following.  \na. Unfiled Federal tax returns TYs 2016 and 2017. Applicant admitted this \nallegation in his Answer, blaming the unavailability of necessary paperwork to file his \nreturns. As noted, the SOR was amended to add TYs 2018 and 2019 to this allegation to \nconform to Applicant\u2019s testimony. He testified that after his marriage ended, he put his tax \nreturns on the \u201cback burner\u201d and tried to focus on the welfare of his two children. He \ncandidly admitted that he was depressed over the loss of his 20-year relationship with his \nwife. He has recently been in contact with the IRS and once he has the necessary \ninformation from the government, he plans to work with a tax preparer and file his \ndelinquent tax returns. His former wife has told him that she filed returns for 2016 for both \nof them. Applicant needs to confirm this information. At another point in his testimony, he \nsaid that he knows he has to file the 2016 and 2017 returns. He does not believe that he \nowes any taxes for the years in question, though he does not know that for sure until he \nfiles. (Tr. at 24-30, 60-62.) \nb. Unfiled state tax returns for TYs 2016-2017. Applicant admitted this allegation\nin his Answer, blaming the unavailability of necessary paperwork to file his returns. As\nnoted, the SOR was amended to add TY 2018 and 2019 to this allegation to conform to\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. He testified that his state tax returns for the tax years in question\nare unfiled. He has talked with someone at the state tax office and was instructed to file\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nhis TY 2017 state return by April 3, 2021. The record is silent as to whether he complied. \n(Tr. at 29-30.) \nc. Collection Account Owed to Municipality A - $304. This bill is for a utility account \nthat Applicant\u2019s landlord kept in his name after he vacated an apartment. He has disputed \nthis bill with the landlord. He testified that the landlord agreed with his dispute and \npromised to provide a letter correcting its error. He never received the letter. He provided \nno documentation in support of his claims in this dispute. (Tr. at 31-32, 37.) \nd. Collection Account Owed to Former Landlord- $1,939. This account is with the \nsame landlord as the one discussed in 1.c above. The landlord kept Applicant\u2019s deposit \nand charged him this additional fee. The landlord claimed that Applicant dumped a sofa \nin front of his apartment when he vacated. Applicant denies that the sofa belonged to him \nor that he left any furniture behind. He testified that he did not break the lease prior to its \ntermination date. He disputed the debt verbally after receiving a letter from the landlord\u2019s \nlaw firm. He advised the law firm that he would not pay this charge. He also testified that \nhe disputed the debt online with the three major credit bureaus. GE 3 and the two other \ncredit reports in the record reflect Applicant\u2019s dispute of this debt. He never heard further \nabout the dispute. He provided no documentation in support of his claims in this dispute. \n(Tr. at 32-39; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 2.) \ne. Medical Collection Account - $572. Applicant had medical insurance to pay this \nbill. He also paid his co-pay. He denies he owes anything further because of his\ninsurance. He believes this is a matter between the insurance company and the medical \nprovider. He has disputed this debt with the credit bureaus. He was unaware of this debt \nprior to receiving the SOR. He does not know the status of this debt. (Tr. at 39-40.)  \n \nOther Medical Collection Accounts \u2013 f. ($570); g. ($203); h. ($995); i. ($679); j. \n($65); and k. ($116). Same as 1.e, above. \nl. Collection Account Owed to Fitness Facility - $324. Applicant advised his fitness \nfacility that he was moving out of the area and he wanted to cancel his contract with the \nfacility. The manager responded that Applicant could only terminate the contract if the \narea to which he was moving had no facility owned by the same company. He testified \nthat he showed the manager his new location on a map and that there was no company \nfacility near that location for him to use in the future. He said that the manager agreed \nwith him and said he would terminate the contract. After Applicant received the SOR, he \ncontacted the company and disputed the bill. He was advised that the company would \ninvestigate the matter, but he never heard further. He has not followed up with the creditor \nand has no documentation to support his dispute. (Tr. at 38, 40-41.) \nm. Collection Account Owed to Retail Business - $93. This debt arose out of \nApplicant\u2019s subscription for a water cooler. According to the Government\u2019s credit reports \nin the record, this debt dates back to 2014 or 2015. He claims he cancelled the \nsubscription when he moved. The July 2019 SCA reflects that Applicant only moved once \nbetween January 2007 and July 2019, and that was in October 2018. He never clarified \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat inconsistency. Applicant testified that the company picked up the equipment, but then \ncharged him for it claiming they never received the equipment. He provided no \ndocumentation to support his dispute. (Tr. at 41-42; GE 1 at 8-9; GE 2 at 1.) \nn. Charged-Off Account on an Auto Loan - $18,988. In June 2013, Applicant \npurchased a vehicle and financed it with the creditor identified in the SOR. That car was \nrepossessed in late 2014 or early 2015 during a period Applicant was unemployed. His \nSCA reflects that he was laid off from a job in July 2014, and he started a new job in \nDecember 2014. He claims that the amount due as alleged in the SOR is the full value of \nthe vehicle, and not the balance due after the car was resold. GE 4 reflects that the \noriginal charge off was in the amount of $27,019 and the present amount owed is $18,988. \nApplicant testified that he was never provided with notice of a deficiency due after the car \nwas resold by the creditor. His testimony that he is unaware of the amount of the debt he \nowes on the defaulted loan is not credible. Moreover, his testimony reflects that he never \ninquired about any further obligations he had under the car loan following his default. He \ndisputes the amount of the debt, but provided no documentation to support his dispute. \nThis debt arose before the date of the SCA and Applicant was obviously aware that the \ncreditor repossessed the vehicle due to his extended default in his monthly payments in \n2014 when he was unemployed. (Tr. at 42-45; GE 1 at 15-17; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 3.) \no. Collection Account Owed to Communications Business - $593. This debt arises \nout of a contract Applicant had with a cellphone provider. He testified that he cancelled \nthe contract due to overcharges and poor service and then the company sent him a bill \nfor the balance due under the contract. He disputes that the creditor had the right to \ncharge him anything further. He provided no documentation to support his dispute. This \ndelinquency arose after the date of the SCA. (Tr. at 45-46.) \np. Collection Account - $757. Applicant does not recognize this collection agency \nor the name of the original creditor listed in GE 5. He disputes this debt without any \nsupportive documentation. (Tr. at 46-50; GE 5 at 2-3.) \nq. Collection Account - $614. The record reflects that this debt was originally owed \nto a bank. Applicant did not initially recognize the names of the bank or its collection \nagency. He then recalled that this bank gave him a payday loan that he never repaid. He \ndoes not dispute this debt and testified that he is willing to repay it. This debt became \ndelinquent after the date of the SCA. (Tr. at 50; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3-4.) \nr. Charged-Off Account Owed to Bank - $514. Applicant agrees he owes this debt. \nHe has recently made a payment arrangement with the bank, with the first payment due \non March 19, 2021 and a final payment due in April 2021. Applicant provided no \ndocumentation to show that he paid this debt in March 2021 and that it has been resolved. \nThis debt became delinquent after the date of the SCA. (Tr. at 50-52; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at \n3; GE 5 at 3.) \ns. Charged-Off Debt Owed to Bank - $542. Applicant agrees that he owes this \ndebt. The bank contacted him to set up a virtual meeting to discuss a resolution of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndebt. That meeting has not yet occurred. This debt became seriously delinquent after the \ndate of the SCA. (Tr. at 52; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 3.) \nAt the time he received the January 2020 SOR, Applicant was employed, though \nhe lost his job in August 2020. Since starting new employment in January 2021, Applicant \nhas begun to address his past-due debts, as shown by his efforts to resolve debt 1.r, \ndiscussed above. He testified that he is doing his best to make sure that his past financial \nproblems are not repeated. Applicant is current on his rent, car loan, utilities, and child-\nsupport. He earns a significant hourly wage in his new position. He met with a credit-\nrepair counselor earlier this year. In his post-hearing submission, AE A, he provided a \ncopy of her engagement contract, dated March 23, 2021. Applicant provided no additional \ndocumentation evidencing steps he has taken with the assistance of his counselor. Also \nAE A makes no mention of the counselor helping Applicant prepare and file his past-due \ntax returns. (Tr. at 17, 21, 62-66; AE A.) \n2. Under Guideline E, the SOR sets forth one allegation. The details of this \nallegation, the underlying facts, and Applicant\u2019s response are set forth below.  \na. The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to disclose in his response to Section 26 \nof the SCA that he had defaulted on any loans in the last seven years; that he had bills \nturned over to collection agencies during the same period; that he had any accounts or\ncredit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled during that period; or that he had been \nover 120 days delinquent on any debts. The SOR references the allegations in\nsubparagraphs 1.c through 1.n.  \n \n \nThis allegation requires the Government to establish that Applicant was aware of \neach of these debts in July 2019 when he signed the SCA. With that as a predicate, the \nGovernment must establish by substantial evidence its allegation that the omission of the \ninformation about the debts was deliberate. The Government presented no evidence that \nApplicant was aware of the debts alleged in 1.e through 1.k, prior to his receipt of the \nSOR. Applicant also testified that he disputes the debts alleged in 1.c, 1.d, 1.l, and 1.m. \nThe question cited in the SOR does not require the disclosure of debts that an applicant \nconsiders to be erroneous. \nThe Government has established, however, that prior to the date of the SCA \nApplicant was aware of his delinquent car loan alleged in subparagraph 1.n. Applicant \ntestified that he only disputes the amount owed. He said he did not think he had to \ndisclose the repossession because it was not recent. The repossession occurred in about \nthe end of 2014, less than five years before his SCA. (Tr. at 42-45, 56-58.) \nApplicant testified that as a first-time applicant for a security clearance, he did not \nrealize that his credit was under review. He just was trying \u201cto get [his] paperwork \nprocessed.\u201d He also believed that his debts were not a current concern because he was \nabout to start working again and could clear up his past debts. He said that he has worked \nin highly sensitive areas like airports and his credit was never a consideration.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions regarding his unfiled \ntax returns establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Six of these mitigating conditions have possible \napplicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Under the circumstances, it cannot be concluded \nthat future delinquent debts are unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s ongoing tax filing \ndelinquencies and his other indebtedness cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. Applicant asserts that his debts arose out \nof his divorce and unemployment, which were circumstances beyond his control. With the \nexception of his delinquent tax returns, he failed to provide evidence linking either adverse \nsituation to any specific debts. Moreover, once Applicant recovered from his divorce in \n2017 or regained employment, he has not acted responsibly by working with his creditors \nto resolve his debts, most of which he disputes. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is only partially established. He has sought counseling prior to the \nhearing and again after the hearing. He has not provided, however, clear evidence that \nhis debts are being resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r, \nexcept that Applicant has provided no evidence to show that he has honored the payment \narrangements. This mitigating condition is not otherwise established as to his other \noutstanding debts and unresolved tax issues. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is only partially established. He testified that he disputed the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.m and 1.o and 1.p. He has not provided, however, any \ndocumentation to support his claims. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Applicant provided no evidence that he has filed any \nof his Federal or state tax returns for the TYs 2016 through 2019, or that he has made \narrangements to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file four years of tax returns is significant evidence of financial \nirresponsibility. The large number of disputed and unresolved delinquent debts provides \nfurther indications that Applicant\u2019s financial affairs are not under control. Moreover, his \nfailure to address these debts with the creditors and seek resolutions reflect a significant \nlack of financial responsibility. His current intentions to do better with his finances does \nnot make up for his inaction in the past and particularly not since he submitted his SCA. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 19 contains seven conditions that are potentially \ndisqualifying under circumstances involving personal misconduct. One of the conditions \nhas possible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe government has met its burden of proof to establish the above potentially \ndisqualifying condition with respect to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose in his 2019 SCA his \ndelinquent 2014 car-loan debt set forth in 1.n. Applicant knew at the time his car was \nrepossessed that he would owe a deficiency on the loan following the resale of the car by \nthe creditor, yet he did not disclose this debt in his SCA. This debt was by far his largest \ndebt and was the most important debt requiring disclosure. The government has not met \nits burden to prove that Applicant deliberately falsified his responses in the SCA with \nrespect to the other debts alleged in paragraph 2 of the SOR. He was either unaware of \nthe debts at the time he signed the SCA or he did not believe he owed the debt claimed \nby the creditor. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. One of these mitigating conditions has possible \napplicability to the facts of this case: \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s omission from his 2019 SCA was not minor. Insufficient time has \npassed since his omission to make it less relevant to an analysis of Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. It is recent evidence of his unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor \njudgment. In signing his SCA, he had an obligation to ensure that all of the information \nprovided was accurate. His claim that he did not understand that disclosing his credit \nhistory was important is not credible and is an insufficient excuse for failing to disclose \nhis largest, most security-significant debt. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence \nas described above leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant=s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

(Item 1) He did not \nprovide any supporting documentation about the status or resolution of his delinquent \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is 58 years old, and he has been employed as a Configuration Analyst \nsince September 2016.

(Item 8) His spouse\u2019s income is as follows: monthly \ngross income is $3,100; monthly net income is $2,383; and monthly retirement is $1,115. \n(Id.) Applicant and his spouse live in the same residence; however, they are estranged \nbecause of her infidelity. (Id.) As of August 29, 2018, he was receiving $1,000 monthly \nfrom his spouse to address their marital debts. (Id.) He has not received any credit \ncounseling. (Id.) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s SOR response, when Applicant and his wife separated, \nher net monthly income was $2,000. (Item 2) For 42 months after they were separated, \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshe provided Applicant $1,000 monthly for bills; however, this was insufficient to keep his \ndebts in current status. (Id.) Currently, she is not providing any funds to address their \ndebts. (Id.) He said he is making progress on his finances, and intends to pay his debts. \n(Id.) Applicant was unemployed for two months from July to September 2016, and his \nseparation from his spouse and unemployment for two months contributed to his \nproblematic financial situation. (Item 8) His most recent credit report of record shows that \nhe paid several non-SOR debts, and several accounts are current. (Item 7) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $122,685 as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a judgment for $60,630 based on a debt owed to a credit union. (Item \n1) The court entered a judgment in November 2018, and a garnishment order in \nSeptember 2019. (Item 4) In September 2020, Applicant said he has counsel and is \nnegotiating a reduction in the magnitude of the debt. (Item 2)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a judgment entered in 2018 for $38,913 based on a debt owed to a \ncredit card entity. (Item 1) In December 2016, a Joint Stipulation of Settlement was filed \nwith the court. (Item 5) In August 2017, a judgment was entered against Applicant for \n$38,913. (Id.) In December 2017, a copy of the garnishment writ was mailed to Applicant\u2019s \nemployer. (Id.) In September 2020, Applicant said the debt was paid down to $1,000 \nthrough garnishment of his wages, and will be fully paid in October 2020.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $122,685. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)). \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control adversely affected his finances, \nincluding about two months of unemployment in 2016, and his spouse\u2019s failure to assist \nwith family or joint debts. However, \u201c[e]ven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, \nin whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still \nconsider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with \nthose financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A \ncomponent is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments to keep debts current. The supporting documentary evidence \nthat Applicant maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep several SOR debts current is limited in this instance to court records \nleading up to judgments and garnishments of his pay. \nApplicant is credited with mitigating SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. He indicated the debts \nwere paid or are being paid through garnishment.

Oct. 15, 2007) (affirming grant of security clearance and \nmitigating security concerns despite garnishment to pay debt because of other financial \ncircumstances). \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts may have been or will soon be either \ncharged off or dropped from his credit report or both. \u201c[A] creditor\u2019s choice to charge-off \na debt for accounting purposes does not affect the debtor\u2019s obligation to the creditor.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-02760 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer.

See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nApplicant did not provide an updated personal financial statement or budget after \nhe received the FORM. It was unclear from the budget in the August 29, 2018 OPM PSI \nwhether he had sufficient funds to address his debts because it appeared he had a \nnegative monthly remainder without the financial assistance of his spouse. He did not \nexplain why the creditors filed for judgments and garnishments if he was making partial \npayments or acting in good faith to establish payment plans. He did not described any \nfinancial counseling. Applicant did not provide any corroborating documentation relating \nto the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, such as: (1) proof of payments, for example, \nchecking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving \nthat he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) correspondence to or from the \ncreditor to establish maintenance of contact; (3) copies of credible debt disputes sent to \nthe creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating he did not believe he was \nresponsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) evidence of attempts to \nnegotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or agreements to show that he \nwas attempting to resolve a debt; or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. \nApplicant said he planned to pay or resolve his debts, except possibly the one that \noriginated with his spouse or was charged off and closed.

Under all the circumstances, \nhe failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 58 years old, and he has been employed as a Configuration Analyst \nsince September 2016. From July 1989 to June 2016, the same company continuously \nemployed him as an Engineering Technologist II. He served in the Navy from March 1982 \nto February 1988. He received an honorable discharge. In 2007, Applicant received an \nassociate\u2019s degree. He attended college from 2007 to 2009. There is no evidence of \nworkplace misconduct, abuse of alcohol, use of illegal drugs, or criminal conduct. He did \nnot provide copies of performance evaluations or character-reference statements. \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. His finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond his control. He paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c through garnishments of his wages. He paid several other non-SOR debts, and \nother accounts are current. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \nprogress resolving the four delinquent SOR debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, totaling \n$72,086.

Applicant submitted an undated response and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 7, 2021. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on July 21, 2021. \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and called three witnesses, but he did not submit any documentary \nevidence. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Israel. The request was not admitted in evidence but was included in the record \nas Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant did not object, and I have taken administrative \nnotice of the facts contained in HE I. The facts are summarized in the written request \nand will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that, while a \nclose ally and trading partner of the United States, Israel has a significant documented \nhistory of using U.S. government employees to obtain classified information and \ncontrolled technologies. The threat of terrorist attacks in Israel is an ongoing concern. A \nU.S. State Department travel warning is in effect for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. \nGaza is under the control of Hamas, a U.S. Government-designated foreign-terrorist \norganization.

(Tr. at 16-23) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father instilled his love of the United States in his children. They \ncelebrated American holidays; Applicant studied American history; and he followed \nApplicant has family members who are citizens and residents of Israel. Israel is a \nclose ally of the United States, but it also has a significant documented history of using \nU.S. government employees to obtain classified information and controlled \ntechnologies. The potential for terrorist violence exists in Israel. It continues to have \nhuman rights issues. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence.  \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Israel. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAmerican sports teams. They periodically visited Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s side of the family in \nthe United States. Applicant realized his dream of moving to the United States in 2008, \nand it is now his home. He has a great job and a future with a company. He has friends \nand family on his father\u2019s side in the United States. He credibly testified that his family in \nIsrael could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.  \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Israel are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. I find that it is unlikely Applicant will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and \nthe interests of Israel. There is no conflict of interest, because Applicant can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and \n8(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains four drug involvement allegations. The origin of these allegations is the September 2019 e-QIP in which Applicant voluntarily disclosed his use of illegal drugs and misuse of prescription drugs. (Tr. 35-38) Applicant admitted all allegations with brief explanations. Applicant is 31 years old. In September 2010, he received an associate\u2019s degree, and in August 2012, he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree. He married in September 2018. (GE 1 at 13-22) He began working as a technical consultant for a company in June 2019. That company was purchased by his present employer where Applicant works as a robotic process automation (RPA) developer. The purpose of his job is to digitize and automate paper-based systems. Applicant is seeking his first security clearance. (Tr. 23-27, 41; AE B) Applicant\u2019s drug involvement began in 2005 when he was 15 years old. He occasionally used marijuana (SOR 1.a) supplied by classmates. At age 17, his use increased to daily or weekly. He smoked the drug in pipes. Applicant\u2019s regular use continued at a community college because he remained in contact with some of the same drug using individuals from high school.

Berry, Esq. \n05/17/2021 \nDecision \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nBetween 2005 and September 2018, Applicant used several drugs at varying \nfrequencies. Though he stopped marijuana use in May 2018, he used cocaine one \nadditional time in September 2018. His use of marijuana, which was regular through \nhigh school and the first two years of college, substantially diminished between 2012 \nand 2017. However, he resumed using the drug in vapor form until May 2018, when he \nstopped altogether. Except for cocaine, his use of the more serious drugs was \nexperimental to sporadic and ended by 2012. In light of his decision to begin to take \ncharge of his career, his health, and his marital responsibilities in 2018, Applicant has \novercome the security concerns engendered by his past drug use and substance \nmisuse... Eligibility for classified information is granted. \nStatement of Case \nOn September 9, 2019, Applicant certified and signed an Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance \nrequired for employment with a defense contractor.

After examining the background investigation, the \nDefense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) could not make the affirmative \nfindings necessary to issue a security clearance. On September 1, 2020, DOD issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse (Guideline H). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), made effective in the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant provided an undated answer to the SOR. I was assigned the case on \nNovember 16, 2020. On January 29, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing for February 26, 2021. The Government\u2019s two \nexhibits and Applicant\u2019s nine exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. On \nMarch 8, 2021, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.); the record closed the \nsame day. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains four drug involvement allegations. The origin of these \nallegations is the September 2019 e-QIP in which Applicant voluntarily disclosed his use \nof illegal drugs and misuse of prescription drugs. (Tr. 35-38) Applicant admitted all \nallegations with brief explanations. \nApplicant is 31 years old. In September 2010, he received an associate\u2019s \ndegree, and in August 2012, he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree. He married in \nSeptember 2018. (GE 1 at 13-22) He began working as a technical consultant for a \ncompany in June 2019. That company was purchased by his present employer where \nApplicant works as a robotic process automation (RPA) developer. The purpose of his \njob is to digitize and automate paper-based systems. Applicant is seeking his first \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 23-27, 41; AE B) \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement began in 2005 when he was 15 years old. He \noccasionally used marijuana (SOR 1.a) supplied by classmates. At age 17, his use \nincreased to daily or weekly. He smoked the drug in pipes. Applicant\u2019s regular use \ncontinued at a community college because he remained in contact with some of the \nsame drug using individuals from high school. After receiving his associate\u2019s degree in \n2010, he moved to another state to attend college and his marijuana use decreased. \nFollowing his graduation from college in 2012, his marijuana use was almost \nnonexistent until late 2017 when he purchased and used some marijuana in vapor form \nand for about two or three months when he regularly ingested small quantities of the \n2 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrug before going to sleep. His last use of marijuana occurred at age 28 in May 2018. In \nhis September 2019 e-QIP, he indicated that he would use marijuana at rare times in \nthe future. However, in October 2019, he declared he would not use marijuana under \nany circumstances because it is against federal law. (GE 2 at 3-4; Tr. 28-31) \nApplicant used cocaine between one and four times a year from August 2008 to \nSeptember 2018. (SOR 1.b) The amounts were small and the locations for use were \nhouse parties or social gatherings. He recalled the drug had little effect on him. His last \nuse of the drug, which was at a bachelor\u2019s party in September 2018, was memorable in \nthat he used a larger amount of the drug than he had used in the past. The drug \nincreased his heart rate and kept him awake until five a.m. the following morning. (GE 1 \nat 37-38, 46; GE 2 at 4-5) \nIn high school and college, Applicant misused the prescription drugs Ritalin and \nAdderall. (SOR 1.c) His purpose for misusing the medications was to increase his \nconcentration on schoolwork. The drugs helped him stay awake at night three or four \ntimes between 2007 and 2012 to prepare for school assignments or examinations. He \nrecalled purchasing both medications at $5.00 a pill. (GE 2 at 4) \nApplicant estimated that he and his friends from high school used LSD and \nmushrooms about 10 to 12 times between 2007 and 2010. LSD had a euphoric effect \non Applicant. The influence of the mushrooms lasted much longer, but the effects were \nnot as intense. (GE 2 at 4) \nApplicant attributed his drug use to youth, peer pressure, and to enhance his \nprospects for socialization. Even though he mingles with some of the same high school \nfriends who have continued to use drugs, they do not offer drugs to him since they know \nhe no longer uses them. He has no future intentions to purchase or use drugs because \nhis career is more important. He fully understands that continued drug use is against \nfederal law. On February 16, 2021, Applicant signed a statement of intent to forego all \nillegal drug use in the future, recognizing that a violation of the statement would \nconstitute grounds for revocation of his national security clearance eligibility. (GE 2 at 5; \nTr. 39; Answer to SOR, 1.a; AE C) \nApplicant\u2019s wife, who also submitted a written character reference, has been a \nnurse for ten years. After dating Applicant for about eight years, she married him in \nSeptember 2018. In the same month, he informed her that he had used cocaine at a \nbachelor\u2019s party in another state. In her view, he appeared disappointed by his use and \ninformed her that continued drug use would not be a part of his lifestyle in the future. \nBased on her concern for Applicant\u2019s long-term health to help her expand their family, \nshe admonished him about using drugs with his high blood pressure that he has been \ntreating since age 23. Subsequently, she observed Applicant focus more on his long-\nterm career aspirations, which motivated him to put his self-taught professional skills to \nwork. Since March 2020, he has provided critical support in helping his wife stay healthy \nas she carries out her frontline-nursing responsibilities during the pandemic.

She does not believe that Applicant has used \nany drugs. She believes Applicant shows good judgment. (Tr. 14-23; AE H) \nCharacter Evidence  \nA mechanical engineer testified telephonically. He also provided a written \ncharacter reference. His friendship with Applicant takes them back about 16 years to \nhigh school. The engineer believes that Applicant stopped using drugs in the fall of 2018 \nto focus on his certifications in order to advance his career and elevate his reliability as \na husband intent on purchasing a home. Based on his weekly contact by phone or in \nperson, the engineer believes Applicant\u2019s honesty and good judgment support a \nfavorable decision to grant him security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 8-14; AE E) \nIn a written character reference, Applicant\u2019s senior director stated that he hired \nhim two years ago. The director has found Applicant to be an outstanding employee \nwho was the only person in the 250 employee-work force to reach advanced RPA \nstatus. Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and team-player attitude convinces the director that \nhe merits a security clearance. (AE D) \nBy written character reference, Applicant\u2019s former coworker and friend noted \nthat he has known Applicant for about eight years. As a security clearance holder, the \nformer coworker recommends Applicant for security clearance suitability based on his \nhonesty and trustworthiness. (AE F) Applicant\u2019s friend, who met him eight years ago, \nconsiders Applicant a trustworthy person whose honest supports his security clearance \napplication. (AE G) \nBy written character reference, another friend stated that he has known \nApplicant for about 18 years. They attended high school and junior college together, \nand eventually became coworkers. In the time they have known each other, Applicant \ndeveloped a reputation of being a diligent and dependable person both at work and in \nhis personal life. Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness is equaled by his loyalty as a friend. (AE I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2005. He regularly used the drug with high \nschool classmates, and he continued to use the drug with some of those individuals in \njunior college. Though he dramatically reduced his use after 2012, he purchased and \nused the drug in vapor form during a two to three-month period before he stopped in \nMay 2018. Applicant\u2019s use falls within the scope of AG \u00b6 25(a). His use of the drug \ninvolves illegal possession of a controlled substance as defined by AG \u00b6 25(c).  \nApplicant\u2019s use of LSD, mushrooms, Ritalin, Adderall, and cocaine constitutes \npossession and use of illegal drugs and misuse of prescription drugs within AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand 25(c). \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of LSD, mushrooms, and Adderall was infrequent and ended by \n2012. His purchase of Ritalin and Adderall is also mitigated by the passage of more \nthan eight years, as well as the miniscule number of times he purchased the \nmedications. More than three and one-half years have passed since Applicant \npurchased and used marijuana. A rapid increase in his heart rate in September 2018, \ncaused by ingesting a much larger amount of cocaine than he had used in the past, was \nall Applicant needed to recognize that even sporadic drug use was placing his health at \nserious risk. The major steps Applicant\u2019 has taken to solidify his career since September \n2018, as confirmed by his wife, the character references, and the awards, justify \ncomplete confidence in Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in September 2019, he acknowledged his \npast illegal drug involvement and misuse of prescription drugs. In his October 2019 PSI, \nafter describing all his past illegal use and misuse as he had done in his e-QIP, he \nstated unequivocally that he would use no drugs in the future as he understood that \ndrug use was against federal law. He repeated those sentiments at the hearing in \nFebruary 2021. Though he continues to associate with some of his friends that he used \ndrugs with in high school and junior college, Applicant credibly testified that he has not \nused illegal drugs since September 2018, and that he will abstain in the future. The \nmechanical engineer corroborated Applicant\u2019s testimony. Based on the favorable \ntestimony from Applicant\u2019s wife describing his efforts to keep her healthy as she \nexecutes her frontline-nursing responsibilities during the pandemic, and his decision to \ntake greater care of his own health, Applicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n26(1) and 26(2). His voluntary disclosure of his illegal drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, combined with his written statement of intent to abstain from future drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, entitles Applicant to full mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n26(3). \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThough Applicant\u2019s September 2019 conditional statement of intention to use \nmarijuana in the future occurred subsequent to his September 2018 promise to his wife \nto forego all drug use in the future, his statement in his October 2019 PSI that he did not \nintend to use any illegal drugs in the future under any circumstances, is both credible \nand persuasive. He acknowledged that drug use was against federal law. Judging by \nthe totality of the evidence, particularly the favorable character evidence from his job \nand his wife, Applicant has overcome the security concerns raised by the guideline for \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n____________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He did not address the paragraphs (\u00b6\u00b6 2.e, 2.i, 2.m, 2.o, and 4.b) that cross-alleged conduct alleged under other guidelines, but since the underlying allegations were admitted, I consider the cross-allegations admitted as well. The admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant was born in October 1990. He is 30 years old. He has never married and he has no children. He graduated from high school in spring 2008. He started college that fall and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He has worked for his current employer and clearance sponsor, a large defense contractor, since April 2017. During 3 most of the time since he graduated from college, Applicant worked for other contractors at the same location, with some gaps in employment when contracts ended. (Item 3) Guidelines J & G: During Applicant\u2019s time in college, he incurred multiple infractions, allegedly for alcohol-related conduct, resulting in discipline from university authorities. He also incurred multiple alcohol-related arrests both during and after his time in college. The first infraction was in October 2008, after Applicant and his college roommate were allegedly playing a drinking game in their dorm room.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nIt is unclear from the file when Applicant received the SOR, or when he \nresponded to it. In his undated Answer, Applicant elected to have his case decided by \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on \nthe administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. On December 10, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 8. The file indicates that the FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant on December 14, 2020, and that he received it on December \n22, 2020. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, nor, by \ndefinition, did he submit additional evidence for the record. The case was assigned to \nme on March 19, 2021. \nGovernment\u2019s Evidence \nThe SOR and the Answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. In his \nAnswer, Applicant admitted all the allegations without further explanation. Item 3 is his \nSeptember 2017 SCA. Item 7 is his FBI Identification Record, detailing his criminal \noffenses. Items 3 and 7 are admitted without further comment. \nItem 4 \nThe documents in Item 4 are unauthenticated summaries of Applicant\u2019s \u201cpersonal \nsubject interviews\u201d (PSIs), conducted in March, April, and May 2018, by an agent of the \nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as part of Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation. Item 4 is the basis for SOR \u00b6 4.a, which Applicant admitted. Item 4 was \nnot authenticated by Applicant, as required under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of Enclosure 3 of the \nDirective. The CAF could have requested that Applicant authenticate Item 4 when it \nsent him interrogatories on other subjects (Items 5 and 6) but did not do so.  \nItem 4 was included with the Government\u2019s FORM, and Applicant was informed \nin the body of the FORM that he could comment on the PSIs, make corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates to make the summaries clear and accurate. He could \nalso object to admission of Item 4 on the grounds that it was unauthenticated. Applicant \nwas also advised that \u201cif no objections are raised in your response to the FORM, or if \nyou do not respond to the FORM, the administrative judge may determine that you have \nwaived any objections to the admissibility of the summary and may consider it as \nevidence in your case.\u201d (FORM, page 2) \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, and therefore did not avail himself of the \nopportunity to object to Item 4. It is therefore admitted. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItems 5 and 6:  \nIn March 2019, the DOD CAF (a predecessor to the DSCA CAF) issued \nApplicant an interrogatory, seeking information about his current and prior alcohol \ninvolvement (Alcohol Use Interrogatory) and about his history of alcohol evaluation, \ntreatment, and counseling, including a request for appropriate records of such \ncounseling or treatment from the providers. (Drug/Alcohol Evaluation/Treatment \nInterrogatory). Item 5 is a document comprised of materials received by the DOD CAF \nin response. The response to the \u201cAlcohol Use\u201d Interrogatory contains relevant \ninformation on that subject, presumably provided by Applicant \u2013 though there is no \nsignature page from him. (Item 5 at 1-8) The response to the \u201cAlcohol \nEvaluation/Treatment/Counseling\u201d Interrogatory includes records from a counseling \ncenter, relating to Applicant, though, again, there is no signature page from him. (Item 5 \nat 9-23) \nIn September 2019, the DOD CAF sent Applicant another interrogatory, \nrequesting that he obtain an individual psychological evaluation. Applicant did so, and \nItem 6 (unlike Item 5) includes a signature page, from Applicant, signed in October \n2019. (Item 6 at 1-4). Curiously, Item 6 also includes the psychological report itself, \nthough it is dated months later, on February 28, 2020. (Item 6 at 5-9) \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, and therefore did not avail himself of the \nopportunity to object to Items 5 or 6. They are therefore admitted. \nItem 8 \nItem 8 is a document submitted in response to an inquiry from OPM, prepared by \nan employee in the registrar\u2019s office at the university Applicant attended. Item 8 details \ninformation reported by the employee based on a review of Applicant\u2019s disciplinary \nrecord. The records from which the information was obtained are not included. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, and therefore did not avail himself of the \nopportunity to object to Item 6. It is therefore admitted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all allegations in the SOR without explanation. He did not \naddress the paragraphs (\u00b6\u00b6 2.e, 2.i, 2.m, 2.o, and 4.b) that cross-alleged conduct \nalleged under other guidelines, but since the underlying allegations were admitted, I \nconsider the cross-allegations admitted as well. The admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant was born in October 1990. He is 30 years old. He has never married \nand he has no children. He graduated from high school in spring 2008. He started \ncollege that fall and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He has worked for his current \nemployer and clearance sponsor, a large defense contractor, since April 2017. During \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \nmost of the time since he graduated from college, Applicant worked for other \ncontractors at the same location, with some gaps in employment when contracts ended. \n(Item 3) \nGuidelines J & G:  \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s time in college, he incurred multiple infractions, allegedly for \nalcohol-related conduct, resulting in discipline from university authorities. He also \nincurred multiple alcohol-related arrests both during and after his time in college. \n \n \nThe first infraction was in October 2008, after Applicant and his college \nroommate were allegedly playing a drinking game in their dorm room. Applicant \nexplained in his background interview that they had been playing the game with water, \nand not with beer. Nevertheless, he was ordered to participate in an alcohol-awareness \nclass, which he did. (Item 4 at 2-3) The university registrar\u2019s office recorded an \ninfraction for possession of \u201calcohol paraphernalia\u201d for which Applicant was found \n\u201cresponsible,\u201d and that he completed an \u201ceducational paper\u201d as a sanction. (Item 8) \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b) \n \n \nOn three additional occasions over the next two years (March 2009, September \n2010, and November 2010), Applicant engaged in drinking in his dorm room. (Item 4 at \n3) These instances violated university policy prohibiting underage drinking. He was \nultimately placed on disciplinary probation and removed from student housing. (Item 8) \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 2.f) \n \n \nIn September 2010, also while underage, Applicant was driving home after a \nnight out drinking with friends when he was pulled over for speeding. He was given a \nbreathalyzer and registered a 0.07 blood alcohol content (BAC). He was arrested and \ncharged with a misdemeanor offense of having an unlawful blood alcohol level (under \n21) of 0.05 or higher, while operating a motor vehicle. He pleaded no contest in \nDecember 2010, and he was ordered to attend alcohol counseling and a DUI program. \nHis driver\u2019s license was also suspended for a month. (Item 3 at 39-40; Item 4 at 6)(SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.e) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant reported on his SCA that he attended alcohol counseling, with Ms. W, \nfrom January to April 2011, and noted that it was court ordered. (Item 4 at 46) In his \nPSI, he generally referenced his counseling with Ms. W, and noted that she had advised \nhim to abstain from alcohol. (Item 4 at 7) SOR \u00b6 2.g, which Applicant admitted, also \nalleges that he was diagnosed at the time with alcohol abuse. Notwithstanding the \nadmission, there is no documented record evidence of either the diagnosis or the \ntreatment in 2011. \nOn or about September 8, 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI) with a 0.14 BAC. He reported in his PSI that he and his \ngirlfriend had a disagreement in a campus parking lot because they had to move the car \nto another lot, and Applicant had been drinking and did not want to drive. (Item 4 at 3) \nUniversity police came to the scene and detained him before turning him over to county \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the criminal sanctions resulting from this event, Applicant was also \nfound responsible by university authorities for violating university policy regarding \nindividuals under the age of 21 concerning possession and/or consumption of alcohol, \namong other university policy violations regarding student conduct. University records, \nas reviewed by an employee of the registrar\u2019s office, indicate that he received \ndisciplinary probation, participated in a counseling assessment, and completed court \nsanctions. (Item 8 at 2) (SOR \u00b6 2.h) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.j, which is also based on review of university records, alleges that on or \nabout September 17, 2012, Applicant was found responsible, sanctioned, and \nsuspended for non-compliance with an official request, complicity in violating the \nstudent code of conduct, disruptive conduct, and hazing. (Item 8) SOR \u00b6 2.j also alleges \nthat Applicant \u201chad consumed alcohol prior to this offense.\u201d This \u201coffense\u201d is not detailed \nanywhere in the record, even in Applicant\u2019s PSI, unless it is already covered in SOR \u00b6 \n2.i. (Item 4 at 3) Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s admission to SOR \u00b6 2.j, it is unclear what \n\u201cconduct\u201d or \u201coffense\u201d is addressed in the allegation, and the details of the sanctions are \nundocumented. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \npolice. He spent the night in jail. (Item 4 at 10) Applicant went to court in March 2013, \nand entered a no contest plea to the DUI charge. He was convicted, ordered to attend \nalcohol treatment, a DUI program, and a victim-impact panel, and his driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for a year. (Item 3 at 41-42; Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 8; Item 7)(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 2.i) \nApplicant reported on his SCA that he attended additional court-ordered alcohol \ncounseling with Ms. W from January to May 2013. (Item 45-46). This was part of his \nsentence for the September 2012 DUI offense discussed above. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.i) In his \nPSI, Applicant generally referenced his counseling with Ms. W, and noted that she had \nadvised him to abstain from alcohol. (Item 4 at 7) SOR \u00b6 2.k, which Applicant admitted, \nalso alleges that he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Notwithstanding the admission, \nthere is no documented record evidence of either the diagnosis or the treatment in \n2013. \nIn September 2013, Applicant was again found responsible by university \nauthorities for violation of university policy regarding guests and alcohol, and complicity \nin violating the student code of conduct. He was required to take a course and was \nreprimanded. (Item 8) Applicant reported in his PSI that this concerned a party in his \ndorm room that was broken up by the RA. (Item 4 at 3) (SOR \u00b6 2.l) While Applicant \nadmitted the allegation, there is no documentation in the record to detail the \ncircumstances of this incident, alcohol-related or otherwise. There is nothing in the \nrecord to reflect that Applicant himself was drinking at the time. \nIn January 2014, Applicant was detained by university police after an argument \nwith his girlfriend. He had been drinking. (Item 4 at 9) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.m) The record \ndoes not reflect that he was arrested as a result. He was again disciplined by the \nuniversity for his disruptive conduct, and placed on probation.

The summary of his PSI reflects that Applicant discussed \nhis high school, community college, and undergraduate education. It also states that \n\u201cafter the Subject [Applicant] provided he had no disciplinary issues while at [his college, \nidentified by name], the Subject was confronted\u201d with his numerous disciplinary \nincidents, including those alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.h, 2.l, and 2.n. (Item 3 at 2-\n4) SOR \u00b6 4.a alleged that Applicant falsified material facts when he stated to the OPM \ninvestigator that he had no disciplinary actions at his university, when in fact he did, and \ndeliberately sought to conceal that information.

(Item 4 at 6) In May 2017, Applicant pleaded no contest to the DUI \ncharge and was convicted. He was sentenced to 10 days of confinement, ordered to \nattend a 16-week substance abuse program, a DUI program, and weekly Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings. He received one year of probation, was required to install \nan ignition interlock device on his car, and his driver\u2019s license was revoked for five \nyears. (Item 3 at 42-43; Item 6 at 6-7; Item 7)(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 2.o) \nAfter spending two days in jail, Applicant spent eight days in an inpatient alcohol \nfacility in May 2017. His initial assessment by the counselor, Mr. S, was a diagnosis of \nsevere alcohol use disorder. Applicant disclosed prior marijuana use that ended several \nyears before, and drinking several times a week from age 18 until the time of his most \nrecent DUI arrest, in November 2016. On discharge from the 16-week program \n(including outpatient treatment) in August 2017, Applicant was diagnosed with \npolysubstance use disorder, in early, partial remission. He was advised to maintain \nabstinence from drugs and alcohol. (Item 5 at 17-22) (SOR \u00b6 2.p) \nGuideline E  \nIn March 2019, the DOD CAF sent Applicant an interrogatory about his history of \nalcohol involvement. (Item 5) He reported drinking one to six beers, twice a week, on \nweekends, between November 2016 (his most recent DUI) and Christmas 2017. (Item 5 \nat 3-4) Applicant\u2019s acknowledged drinking up to at least Christmas 2017 was after he \nwas advised to abstain from alcohol use as recently as August 2017, by Mr. S., in the \nsubstance abuse program. (SOR \u00b6 2.q) \nGuideline I \nIn January 2020, DOD CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation. \nThe evaluator, Dr. B, a Ph.D. licensed clinical psychologist and board-certified \nneuropsychologist, reviewed Applicant\u2019s 2017 counseling records and his 2018 report of \ninvestigation (ROI) from 2018, including his background interview summaries. The \nevaluation report reflects that Applicant reported his most recent use of alcohol was \nChristmas 2018, not Christmas 2017; he said he consumed five or six drinks at a time \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich he also estimated as the \u201cnormal\u201d amount of consumption for the average person. \n(Item 6 at 6-7) \nIn her report (Item 6 at 8), Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, \nsevere (provisional). (SOR \u00b6 2.r) She concluded as follows: \nWhile I cannot confirm a personality disorder in this case, it is worth of \nnote that I identified this applicant as having an overly inflated sense of \nself-worth and lack of acceptance for his inappropriate illegal behaviors \nhistorically, which could be indicative of the very diagnosis of antisocial \npersonality disorder indicated by his psychological testing. However, \nbased on the medical records and history of this applicant, a diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder, severe, is certainly likely. Though he reports not \ndrinking for a little over a year, he has a recent history of giving varying \ninformation about his alcohol intake and his general lack of insight into the \nproblematic behavior is concerning to me as a clinician. I have concerns \nregarding his risk of relapse. He is not in treatment, and has received \ntreatment only when mandated by this [sic] courts and his inconsistent \nreporting of use leads me to believe he still may be abusing alcohol; \nhowever, at minimum it raises concerns about his candor and as such his \nreliability/judgment/trustworthiness. His insight is poor. (Item 6 at 8) \n(Emphasis added) \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted all the allegations without \nproviding any explanation or comment. He also did not respond to the FORM. He \ntherefore did not offer any evidence to mitigate any security concerns established by the \nGovernment. \nPolicies \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker) of \nalcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline J allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d are all cross-alleged under \nGuideline G (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e, 2.i, 2.m, and 2.o, respectively). They are all established by \nthe record evidence, and they all satisfy AG \u00b6 22(a). (This includes SOR \u00b6 1.c, which, \nas noted below, is not established as criminal conduct, since Applicant was not \narrested). \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s alcohol involvement while in college led to numerous \ndisciplinary infractions. These allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.h, and 2.n) also \nsatisfy AG \u00b6 22(a). As noted above, it is not established that the infraction alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 2.l was alcohol-related. \nAs discussed above, notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s admission to the allegation, \nSOR \u00b6 2.j (concerning university discipline imposed on or about September 17, 2012) is \neither duplicative of SOR \u00b6 1.i (concerning the events of September 8, 2012) or it is \ninsufficiently detailed to establish that it concerned a second, separate event. No AGs \napply to SOR \u00b6 2.j. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.k, allege, in part, that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol \nabuse, during court-ordered counseling with Ms. W., in 2011 and 2013, respectively. \nNotwithstanding the admission, there is no documented record evidence of such a \ndiagnosis, in either 2011 or 2013. AG \u00b6 22(d) does not apply to those allegations. \nAG \u00b6 22(d) applies to Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of severe alcohol abuse disorder, in \nhis initial assessment by Mr. S, in May 2017, and to the diagnosis of polysubstance \nabuse, in early, partial remission, when Applicant was discharged from the treatment \nprogram, in August 2017. \nIn SOR \u00b6 2.r, Dr. B.\u2019s provisional diagnosis of severe alcohol disorder is alleged \nas a security concern under Guideline G, but the diagnosis was not confirmed. It is \ntherefore not sufficient to apply AG \u00b6 22(d). \nApplicant was advised to abstain from alcohol on several occasions, including by \nMs. W during her counseling (in either 2011, 2013, or both). More recently, he was \nadvised to abstain from alcohol use (and illegal drug use) by Mr. S in 2017, in \nconnection with the diagnosis of polysubstance abuse disorder in early, partial \nremission. Notwithstanding this diagnosis, Applicant\u2019s drinking continued to at least \nChristmas 2017, or even Christmas 2018, as found by Dr. B. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and 22(f) are \ntherefore satisfied. \nApplicant has a long history of problematic alcohol involvement, going back not \nonly to when he was in college, but also when he was underage. He incurred numerous \ndisciplinary infractions while in college, all related to alcohol consumption. He has \nincurred several alcohol-related arrests, both during and after college. All of these \ninstances are examples of conduct stemming from impaired judgment. During \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 evaluation, he said his drinking pattern was to consume five or six \ndrinks at a time, an amount he also estimated as the \u201cnormal\u201d amount of consumption \nfor the average person. (Item 6 at 6-7) Given Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nand its direct relation to his history of criminal conduct and disciplinary record, I find that \nApplicant therefore has a history of habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point \nof impaired judgment. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \nApplicant has a long and troubled history of alcohol involvement. His drinking led \nto repeated disciplinary actions in college and he has several alcohol-related arrests. He \nhas a diagnosis of severe alcohol use disorder in May 2017, and a polysubstance \nabuse disorder in early, partial remission. He was evaluated in 2020 and was found to \nhave poor insight into his drinking, a lack of candor, and questionable judgment and \nreliability. Applicant has not fully acknowledged the extent of his problems with alcohol, \nor with the severity of the consequences of his actions. He is not currently in treatment \nor counseling for his alcohol issues. \nEven if Applicant\u2019s assertions that he has consumed no alcohol since December \n2017 were true (which the evaluator doubts), he offered no more recent evidence in \nmitigation. He did not provide any explanation or update about his abstinence or \ndrinking habits, or his efforts to resolve them through counseling or treatment. He did \nnot submit updated information sufficient to mitigate or overcome the security concerns \nabout his history of alcohol involvement. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation.  \nApplicant has a long history of alcohol-related criminal offenses, committed both \nwhen he was in college and afterwards. He incurred alcohol-related arrests in \nSeptember 2010, September 2012, and in November 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) \napply to those offenses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d) \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s admission, SOR \u00b6 1.c is not established as criminal \nconduct. He was detained by university police and was disciplined by the university, but \nthere is no record evidence that he was arrested in January 2014. He acknowledged \nbeing under the influence of alcohol (a factor addressed under Guideline G, below), but \nhe was of age, so criminal conduct is not established by that admission alone. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent DUI (in November 2016) (SOR \u00b6 1.d) led to a one-year \nprobation term, as part of his sentence, issued in May 2017. That one-year term has \nnow presumably expired. His driver\u2019s license was revoked for five years \u2013 until May \n2022. That revocation has not expired \u2013 a fact to be addressed in mitigation, below. But \nthe ongoing revocation of Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license does not itself satisfy AG \u00b6 31(c). \nThe following mitigating conditions for criminal conduct are potentially applicable \nunder AG \u00b6 32:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s long-term problems with alcohol have led to several arrests, both \nduring and after college. His most recent such offense was in November 2016. While he \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis no longer on probation for that offense, he is still dealing with the consequences of it, \nas his driver\u2019s license remains revoked until May 2022. His criminal conduct is repeated, \nof a similar nature, and is recent. His prior actions continue to cast doubt on his current \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. He has not established that either mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) or 32(d) should apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  \n12 \n \nApplicant submitted his SCA in September 2017, and had his initial background \ninterview in March 2018. The summary of that PSI reflects that Applicant discussed his \nhigh school, community college, and undergraduate education. It also states that \u201cafter \nthe Subject [Applicant] provided he had no disciplinary issues while at [his college, \nidentified by name], the Subject was confronted\u201d with his numerous disciplinary \nincidents, including those alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.h, 2.l, and 2.n. (Item 3 at 2-\n4) SOR \u00b6 4.a alleged that Applicant falsified material facts when he stated to the OPM \ninvestigator that he had no disciplinary actions at his university, when in fact he \ndeliberately sought to conceal that information. Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 4.a without \nexplanation. AG \u00b6 16(b) is therefore established.  \n\n \n \n \n \nIn SOR \u00b6 4.b, the Government cross-alleged Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.d, 2.f, 2.h, 2.j, 2.l, 2.n, and 2.q) as independent security concerns \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct. (Curiously, neither Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d nor the related cross-allegations under SOR \u00b6 2) were cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E).  Applicant\u2019s numerous incidents of alcohol-related misconduct, \nleading to disciplinary actions by the university all satisfy the general personal conduct \nsecurity concern of AG \u00b6 15 (conduct involving questionable judgment and \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations). AG \u00b6 16(c) also applies to the \nsubparagraphs of SOR paragraph 2 (all noted above) that were cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n4.b.  \n \n \nThe remaining subparagraph cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.b is SOR \u00b6 3.a, which \nconcerns the findings and conclusions from the January 2020 psychological evaluation. \nWhile the psychologist makes findings and conclusions about Applicant\u2019s personal \nconduct, I am unable to conclude that these findings and conclusions are properly \nalleged as a personal conduct security concern under Guideline E.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \nAs to SOR \u00b6 4.b, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply for the same reasons as \nset forth in the analysis of the mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and G, above. As \nto SOR \u00b6 4.a, there is no evidence that Applicant attempted to correct his omissions \nbefore being confronted by the interviewing agent about his disciplinary history in \ncollege. The DOD evaluator also specifically cited Applicant\u2019s lack of candor about his \nalcohol use as an ongoing concern. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set forth in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nThe basis for a Guideline I case here is, potentially, twofold: 1) the diagnostic \nresults of the psychological evaluation that constitute a Guideline I security concern \nunder AG \u00b6 28(b) and 2) any behavior issues appropriately classified as a security \nconcern under AG \u00b6 28(a). \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder severe \n(provisional). As with Guideline G AG \u00b6 22(d) above, a provisional diagnosis of an \nalcohol use disorder is not sufficient to establish application of AG \u00b6 28(b) under \nGuideline I. Nor is an alcohol use disorder alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a, under Guideline I. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges certain of the psychologist\u2019s findings about Applicant\u2019s \nimpulsiveness, risk-taking, lack of candor, lack of insight and acceptance of \nresponsibility for his illegal and inappropriate behavior that \u201cmay be indicative of a \npersonality disorder.\u201d However, the psychologist does not conclude that Applicant has a \npersonality disorder. AG \u00b6 28(b) therefore does not apply. \n14 \n \nAs to AG \u00b6 28(a), Applicant\u2019s security significant behavior unquestionably \u201ccasts \ndoubt on [his] judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness\u201d and is also \nunquestionably \u201cirresponsible.\u201d However, since several other guidelines are implicated \n(as discussed at length above), it cannot be said that Applicant\u2019s behavior is \u201cnot \ncovered under any other guideline.\u201d (Emphasis added) Moreover, while the psychologist \nnoted Applicant\u2019s \u201coverly inflated sense of self-worth and lack of acceptance\u201d of his \ninappropriate illegal behaviors, she pointedly began the conclusion of her report by \nnoting that she \u201ccannot confirm a personality disorder in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added). \nFor all of those reasons, I cannot conclude that AG \u00b6 28(a) applies. Since no Guideline I \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions are established, I need not address applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, G, I, and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. \nApplicant has yet to come to terms with the full extent of his alcohol issues \u2013 \nissues which underlie all other security concerns in this case. He needs to establish a \nsignificant, sustained track record of abstinence or sobriety, supported by appropriate \ncounseling or treatment, and a favorable prognosis, as well as a track record of \ncompliance with the law before he can be considered a suitable candidate for access to \nclassified information.

The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn January 20, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 7. (Item 1 is the SOR) Applicant did not submit \na timely response. There were no objections by Applicant, and all Items are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except the amount owed in \u00b6 1.c. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old and a high school graduate. She is unmarried and has \nno children. She served in the Navy from 2003 to 2015 and received an honorable \ndischarge in the paygrade E-5. Her discharge paper (DD 214) noted in the narrative that \nthe reason for separation was due to unsatisfactory performance. Applicant held a \nsecurity clearance while in the military. (Items 3, 4) \nIn January 2013, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) (first \noffense) after recording a .08% on a breathalyzer. The charge was reduced to Road \nSpeed in excess of 80 miles per hour. She was given a 30-day suspended sentence, \nunsupervised probation for three years, a $586 fine and court costs. (Items 3, 4, 6) \nIn June 2015, Applicant consumed three double Jack Daniels with coke before \nleaving a bar. She did not initially feel the effect, but while driving she began to feel \nintoxicated. She hit a curb and the airbag on her car deployed. A police officer arrived on \nscene. She was arrested for DWI (first offense). Applicant pleaded guilty and was given \na 365-day sentence that was suspended, two years of unsupervised probation, one year \nof a restricted license, an ignition interlock system, and was ordered to attend counseling, \nalong with fines and court costs. She attended Alcoholics Anonymous for about two \nweeks as part of the sentence. It is unknown if Applicant was still on probation from her \n2013 offense. (Items 3, 4, 7) \nApplicant was also disciplined by her command at a Uniform Code of Military \nJustice Article 15 hearing. She was found guilty of Article 111, reckless or drunken \noperation or control of a vehicle. She was reduced one paygrade to E-5, forfeited half a \nmonth\u2019s pay for two months, and 45 days restriction and extra duties. She was required \nto attend a 35-day Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program (SARP), which is an \ninpatient alcohol treatment program. She completed the program in August 2015 and was \nrequired to attend AA classes and abstain from consuming alcohol. (Items 3, 4, 8, 9) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.e alleged Applicant received Level III substance abuse \ntreatment at a Naval medical facility from July 2015 to August 2015, was diagnosed with \nAlcohol Disorder Moderate to Severe, and she was required to abstain from alcohol \nconsumption. The record does not provide evidence of the identity or the qualifications of \nwho made the diagnosis. The intake form from the Level III SARP states that the program \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis for patients who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe substance use \ndisorders. The aftercare forms state that the continuing care process takes place over 12 \nmonths and is designed to optimize the participant\u2019s success in maintaining \nsobriety/abstinence and therapeutic gains. There is no evidence that Applicant was \nrequired to abstain from alcohol consumption after the 12-month aftercare program was \ncompleted. There is insufficient evidence to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and \n2.e and I find in Applicant\u2019s favor. (Items 4, 8, 9) \nApplicant received an unfavorable performance evaluation after her DWI \nconviction and was removed from her position because it required that she have access \nto nuclear information. She could no longer work in her rate without this access and \ndeclined to convert to a new rate, so she separated from the Navy. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant was interviewed under oath by a government investigator in October \n2018. During the interview she described her alcohol consumption as three to four drinks \na week, on weekends and in social settings. She intended to continue light, social \ndrinking, but not to intoxication. She intended to call a rideshare service and not drink and \ndrive. Applicant did not provide more recent information regarding her alcohol \nconsumption. (Item 4) \nWhile serving in the Navy, Applicant received a reenlistment bonus. Applicant and \nthe Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) disagree on the amount. DFAS \ncontends it was $42,000. Applicant contends she only received $21,000 of the amount. \nIn her January 2017 security clearance application, she stated: \nMy W-2 was wrong. I\u2019m still fighting this. My previous W-2 annotated that I \nhad received approx[imately] $42,000 in addition to my actual earnings. So \nit looks like I did not pay taxes on the $42,000, but I never received that \nmoney. (Item 3) \nShe further stated: \u201cI am still in contact with the military about fixing my old W-2. I have \nalso had contact with the IRS regarding this issue.\u201d (Item 3) Applicant stated under section \n26 of her SCA that \u201cthe account is closed and repayment of correct amount was \naccomplished via docking my pay whilst still in the Navy.\u201d (Item 3) She said: \u201cHave not \nbeen sent anything such as a bill so that I can make payment. Hope to have issue \ncompletely resolved within 6 months.\u201d (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2018 background interview she stated that she was unaware of the \ndebt until January 2017 when DFAS directed her pay be garnished until the entire amount \nwas recouped. Her September 2019 credit bureau report reflects a balance owed of \n$19,058. It is unknown if Applicant\u2019s current pay is being garnished. She was required to \nrepay the bonus because she was discharged from the military before completing her \nenlistment. The bonus amount affected Applicant\u2019s income and was reflected on her 2015 \nW-2 form.

Applicant failed to file her 2016 through 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns on the premise that she needed her 2015 tax return filed before she \ncould process any of the following tax years. In her September 2020 answers to \ngovernment interrogatories, Applicant stated that she had \u201cpaid more than the half that I \nreceived back in 2014.\u201d (Item 4) She stated that she was attempting to determine who to \ncontact, what forms to complete, and where to send them. She stated once she corrected \nthe 2015 tax year information, she would fix the following years. In her answer to the \nSOR, she stated that she paid in excess of $30,000 toward the debt. Applicant did not \nprovide any documentary evidence to substantiate her claim of payments or to show \nactions she may have taken in the past to resolve the debt with DFAS or to file her \ndelinquent federal and state income tax returns. However, the credit report reflects that \nthe balance on the amount originally owed (presumably $42,000) has decreased, so \npayments have been received. (Items 3, 4) \nThe IRS provides information on their website regarding what to do if a person \nfailed to file their tax return. It states: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t filed your federal income tax return \nfor this year or for previous years, you should file your return as soon as possible \nregardless of your reason for not filing the required return.\u201d (Item 10) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant failed to timely file her 2015 through 2019 federal and state income tax \nreturns. She has failed to resolve a delinquent debt for a reenlistment bonus she received \nin 2014. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant admitted she has not filed her 2015 through 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns because she has a dispute with DFAS about the amount she owes for \na reenlistment bonus , and which was reflected on her 2015 W-2. Applicant\u2019s dispute does \nnot absolve her from complying with the filing requirements of her federal and state tax \nreturns for the past five years. In 2017 when she completed her SCA, she indicated it \nwould be resolved in six months. She has not provided any documentary evidence to \nshow what actions she has taken to resolve the dispute over the debt, any voluntarily \npayments she has made toward the debt, or that she has filed her delinquent federal and \nstate tax returns. She indicated her wages were being garnished, but she failed to provide \nproof of her claim. Her 2019 credit bureau report reflects a $19,058 debt owed. Her \nfinancial issues are not resolved and her conduct casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(e) do not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were within her control and a result of her discharge \nfrom the military because she could no longer have access to nuclear information after \nher DWI conviction. She chose not to change her rate and instead was discharged. She \nhad received a reenlistment bonus that she was required to repay. Although she disputes \nthe amount owed, it does not absolve her from complying with the law and filing her \nfederal and state income tax returns, which she has not done for tax years 2015 through \n2019. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nGarnishment is not considered a good-faith effort to repay a debt. Applicant has \nfailed to provide evidence that she is actively resolving the debt or that her wages are still \nbeing garnished to resolve it. There is no evidence Applicant has received financial \ncounseling or any information about her current finances. Applicant indicated in her SCA \nthat she was in contact with the IRS, but there is no evidence to support her statement. I \nfind none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested in January 2013 for DWI. The charge was amended and \nshe was found guilty of Road Speed in excess of 80 miles per hour. She was arrested \nand convicted of DWI in June 2015. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating condition under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \nApplicant completed Level III SARP in 2015. In her 2018 background interview she \nacknowledged that she continues to consume alcohol in moderation and does not drive \nafter drinking, but rather uses a rideshare. There is no evidence that Applicant has had \nany additional problems with alcohol abuse since her 2015 conviction and discharge from \nthe military. It has been almost six years since her DWI conviction. I find sufficient time \nhas passed and her past issue does not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has not had any alcohol-related issues since 2015. Sufficient time has \nelapsed, and she has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption. She has not mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Her failure to resolve her debt to DFAS and file her delinquent income tax \nreturns for the past five years raises serious security concerns. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Quality Engineer, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has eight delinquent Federal student loan accounts that were placed for collection totaling in excess of $52,985. In his answer, Applicant denies each of the debts listed in the SOR, arguing that he never applied for the loans and that they were fraudulently opened by the university without his consent. Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated August 20, 2019; March 10, 2020; and December 21, 2020, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 7, 8, and 9.)

He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Quality Engineer, and is seeking \nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has eight delinquent Federal \nstudent loan accounts that were placed for collection totaling in excess of $52,985. In \nhis answer, Applicant denies each of the debts listed in the SOR, arguing that he never \napplied for the loans and that they were fraudulently opened by the university without \nhis consent. Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated August 20, 2019; March 10, 2020; and \nDecember 21, 2020, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 7, 8, and 9.)  \nApplicant served in the United States Air Force on active duty from 2006 until his \nhonorable discharge in 2010. Later in 2010, he began attending a university, and \nsuccessfully completed five semesters: spring 2010; summer 2010; fall 2010; spring \n2011; and summer 2011. Applicant graduated with his degree in August 2012. He has \nbeen working for his current employer since June 2019. \nApplicant stated that he used his Post 9/11 GI Bill educational benefit to pay for \nhis tuition to attend the university. \nHe further contends that his education benefit \ncovered the full costs of his tuition. He asserts that the university opened up the loans \nwith Sallie Mae on Applicant\u2019s behalf without his permission. (Government Exhibit 5.) \nApplicant states that he did not apply for the Federal student loans, and that they were \nunnecessary because of his GI Bill benefit. Applicant acknowledges that in August \n2012, he started receiving bills for the Federal student loans. At that time, he contacted \nthe university and was told that the loans were for tuition expenses that were not \ncovered by his GI Bill benefit. \n(Government Exhibit 6.) \nApplicant disagreed, and \nbetween 2012 and 2019 continued to correspond with both the university and Sallie \nMae, consistently asserting that he is not responsible for the loans.

Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentation submitted with his Answer reflects that his five semester of tuition at the \ncollege totaled $72,775.  Additionally, $60,012.33 was disbursed from the GI Bill \nbenefits; however only $30,442 of that sum was paid directly to the college by check.  \nThe remaining $29,569.83 was disbursed to Applicant by a direct deposit.  It is not clear \nwhat happened to the sum that was paid directly to the Applicant.  (Government Exhibit \n4.)    \nApplicant failed to respond to the FORM. He provided no documentation to \nsupport his contention that he is not liable for his Federal student loan debt. He \nprovides no evidence to prove that the tuition required by the college was excessive or \nfraudulent or that the federal student loans were opened without his knowledge or \npermission. \nThe following delinquent Federal student loan accounts in the SOR remain owing \nand are of security concern: \na.

A delinquent Federal student loan account owed to a creditor was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $6,441. \nApplicant denies the debt. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) Applicant provided no documentary evidence to show that \nhe has paid the debt.  The debt remains owing. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report shows that each of the Federal student loans \nremains owing. (Government Exhibit 9.) Applicant was not successful in his argument \nto the university or to Sallie Mae that he never applied for the student loans. In fact, \nfrom the calculations on his student financial summary, his GI Bill benefits and monies \nfrom the Federal student loans were used to pay his tuition. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent student loan debt. He continues to owe the \ndebt and has made no effort to resolve it. There is insufficient information in the record \nto conclude that he is financially stable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has \nthe financial resources available to pay this financial obligation. \nThe evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has been working full-time for his current employer since July 2019. \nThere is nothing in the record to show that any progress has been made toward \nresolving his delinquent student loan debts. Applicant offers only that he never applied \nfor the loans, and that they were unnecessary because his tuition was covered by his GI \nBill benefit. Clearly the university records show differently. Applicant believes that the \ncollege is known for predatory lending against veterans, and that he was a victim of \nfraud. Despite his assertions, Applicant has not provided any documentation to support \nhis contentions. A close look at Applicant\u2019s student account summary shows that there \nwas a tuition deficiency that remained after Applicant\u2019s GI Bill Benefit was credited to his \ntuition costs. Thus, Applicant\u2019s financial indebtedness remains recent, is ongoing, and \nhas not been resolved. In fact, Applicant\u2019s response to the problems do not seem \nreasonable. Applicant has not shown good judgment or made a good faith effort to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepay his creditor or otherwise show that he can resolve the debt. \nUnder the \ncircumstances, he has not acted reasonably and responsibly. Sufficient mitigation has \nnot been shown. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h. \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately October 2013 to about August 2018, while he was \u201cgranted access to classified information\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a). (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted that he had used marijuana, but denied that he used marijuana while having any access to classified information. He explained that on the few occasions where he \u201cmade the poor decision to use marijuana, [he] was working for companies [and] that [he] had no sponsored clearance.\u201d (Item 2.) After considering the pleadings (Items 1-2), Government exhibits (Items 3-5), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 41-year-old principal security consultant employed by a company that supports offensive engagements for both commercial and U.S. government clients. He has been married to his current spouse since March 2014. A previous marriage ended in divorce in February 2013. He has an 18-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son from that marriage. (Item 3.) Applicant worked as a senior information systems technician for a company in the commercial sector from January 1998 to January 2001. He then served on active duty as an infantryman in the U.S. Army from February 2002 to May 2007, when he was honorably discharged at the rank of staff sergeant due to a service-related disability. During his time on active duty, he was deployed to Kuwait and Pakistan from August 2002 to November 2002 and ",

On November 23, 2020, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), including the pleadings (Items 1 and 2), three documentary \nexhibits (Items 3 through 5), and legal statutes and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \npolicy guidance for administrative notice. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant, and instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant submitted a response on January 25, 2021. Department Counsel filed no \nobjection to his response. \nOn February 25, 2021, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. I received the case file on March 4, 2021. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 5 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on February 22, 2019, by an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The summary \nreport was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 \nE3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence \nand considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following important notice regarding Item 5: \nThe attached summary of your PSI is being provided to the Administrative \nJudge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your \nresponse to this [FORM], you can comment on whether the PSI [summary] \naccurately reflects the information you provided to the authorized OPM \ninvestigator and you can make any corrections, additions, deletions and \nupdates necessary to make the summary clear and accurate.

He was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was \nadvised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary \nreport, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or \nupdates to the information in the report. Applicant did not object to the FORM or indicate \nthat the PSI summary contained inaccurate information. \nAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to \ntake timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. \n12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, \n2018) (holding that it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any \nobjection had been waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right \nto object). Applicant has a college degree. He can reasonably be held to have read the PSI \nsummary, and there is no evidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file any \nobjections to the summary if he did not want the administrative judge to consider it. \nAccordingly, I find that he waived any objections to the PSI summary. Government officials \nare entitled to a presumption of regularity in the discharge of their official responsibilities. \nSee e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). There is nothing in the record \nto doubt the accuracy of the summary. \nMoreover, some of the information in the summary is mitigating, and Applicant may \nhave benefitted from some consideration of the summary. For example, Applicant indicated \nduring his interview that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. Applicant may \nhave relied on the admissibility of the summary, and it would violate due process for me to \nexclude it from consideration without a timely objection. See ISCR Case No. 15-05252 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 13, 2016). \nThe SOR (Item 1) and Answer (Item 2) are incorporated in the record as the \npleadings. Items 3 through 5 are accepted into evidence as Government\u2019s exhibits. \nApplicant\u2019s rebuttal to the FORM is admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, I also agree to take \nadministrative notice of Title 21 Sections 802, 812, and 813 of the United States Code \n(U.S.C.) and the policy guidance of the then DNI issued on October 25, 2014, requiring \nadherence to Federal laws prohibiting marijuana use by those holding or seeking access to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information or a sensitive position.

(Item 1.) When Applicant answered the \nSOR, he admitted that he had used marijuana, but denied that he used marijuana while \nhaving any access to classified information. He explained that on the few occasions where \nhe \u201cmade the poor decision to use marijuana, [he] was working for companies [and] that \n[he] had no sponsored clearance.\u201d (Item 2.) \nAfter considering the pleadings (Items 1-2), Government exhibits (Items 3-5), and \nAE A, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 41-year-old principal security consultant employed by a company that \nsupports offensive engagements for both commercial and U.S. government clients. He has \nbeen married to his current spouse since March 2014. A previous marriage ended in \ndivorce in February 2013. He has an 18-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son from that \nmarriage. (Item 3.) \nApplicant worked as a senior information systems technician for a company in the \ncommercial sector from January 1998 to January 2001. He then served on active duty as \nan infantryman in the U.S. Army from February 2002 to May 2007, when he was honorably \ndischarged at the rank of staff sergeant due to a service-related disability. During his time \non active duty, he was deployed to Kuwait and Pakistan from August 2002 to November \n2002 and to Iraq from January 2003 to June 2003, and January 2005 to January 2006. For \nexceptional meritorious service during combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom III, he was awarded the Army Commendation Medal in November 2005. (AE A.) \nFollowing his discharge, Applicant worked part time in sales until October 2007, \nwhen he became employed as a security specialist for a U.S.-government contractor. From \nOctober 2007 to January 2009, he ensured the safety and security of U.S. government \npersonnel and U.S. Embassy support personnel in Afghanistan. (AE A.) He held a secret \nclearance for his duties, which was issued by the U.S. State Department in December \n2007. (Items 3-4; AE A.) In April 2008, then U.S. Vice President Cheney expressed his \nappreciation for Applicant\u2019s professionalism and dedication during the Vice President\u2019s trip \nto Afghanistan. (AE A.) For medical reasons, Applicant was unable to continue in his \nposition, and in February 2010, he took a position as a recruiter for the company. He left \nthat job in August 2011 to pursue his college studies full time. (AE A.) \nApplicant worked full time as a recruiter with a U.S. government contractor from \nJanuary 2012 to May 2014 while continuing to pursue his college degree online and night \nand weekend classes.

He used marijuana in October 2013. (Item 3; AE A.) The circumstances of that \ndrug involvement are not detailed in the record. \nApplicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer and information science in April \n2014. (AE A.) In June 2014, he began working as a \u201ccyber security penetration tester\u201d for \nanother government contractor. To support a cyber-security program for the Department of \nHomeland Security, he applied for security clearance eligibility. He asserts that he \ndisclosed his \u201crecent use of marijuana.\u201d (AE A.) In August 2014, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) granted Applicant a Secret \nclearance for his duties. (Item 4.) \nFrom January 2017 to June 2017, Applicant worked for a commercial company in \ncyber security. (Item 3.) He denies he was sponsored for a security clearance at that time \n(AE A), and there is no evidence that he accessed classified information at that time, \nalthough a JPAS entry indicates that he held a Secret clearance based on the 2014 grant \nof clearance eligibility. (Item 4.) Sometime during that employment, he used marijuana on \none occasion with his wife and a friend (hereafter friend X). (Item 5.) \nBetween June 2017 and February 2018, Applicant was employed by a U.S.\u00ad\ngovernment contractor to conduct penetration tests for a non-DOD U.S.-government entity. \nHe asserts that he was sponsored for security clearance eligibility. (Item 3; AE A.) \nFrom April 2018 to October 2018, Applicant worked as an instructor and conducted \ntesting on commercial contracts. (Items 3, 5; AE A.) Applicant does not believe that his \nemployer had any government contracts. He used marijuana during this time frame on \nthree occasions, i.e., once in his home and twice while with friend X during trips to Seattle \nand Las Vegas. (Item 5; AE A.) \nApplicant began working for his present employer in October 2018. He was \napproached for the position and \u201cjumped at the opportunity to support the federal \ngovernment and DOD spaces again.\u201d (AE A.) On December 2, 2018, Applicant completed \nand certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for \na Top Secret clearance. In response to an SF 86 inquiry into whether he had illegally used \na drug or controlled substance in the last seven years, Applicant reported that he used \nmarijuana between approximately June 2013 (not October 2013 alleged in the SOR) and \nAugust 2018, \u201con a few occasions. Such as in Las Vegas or on a trip to Seattle.\u201d He \nresponded negatively to an inquiry into whether he intended to use the drug in the future \nand stated, \u201cI have never smoked pot while holding a security clearance and have no \nintentions of changing that. I have never failed a urinalysis for any employer.\u201d (Item 3.) \nOn January 9, 2019, the OPM opened a T5 background investigation on Applicant. \n(Item 4.) On February 22, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe OPM. Applicant described his marijuana use as very infrequent and never while he \nheld a security clearance. He indicated that he used marijuana with his wife and friend X at \nhis home in 2017; in Las Vegas with friend X in August 2018; with friend X in Seattle in \n2018; and once in his home in 2018.

They speak while playing computer games online. \nHe admitted that he had contact with friend X the day before his OPM interview through \nonline chatting. (Item 5.) \nOn September 22, 2020, the DCSA CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging that \nhe used marijuana between October 2013 and August 2018 \u201cwhile granted access to \nclassified information.\u201d (Item 1.) In his October 5, 2020 response to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted that he had \u201cmade the poor decision to use marijuana\u201d a few times, but he \nasserted that when he used marijuana, he \u201chad no sponsored clearance.\u201d He added that, \nat no time, had he compromised his integrity while holding a security clearance. (Item 2.) \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant reiterated on January 25, 2021, that while he \nhad used marijuana on a few occasions during the period from October 2013 to about \nAugust 2018, when he used the marijuana, he did not have access to classified information \nand was not working for entities where he was sponsored for security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant stated that he has \u201cdisassociated with those whom [he] used marijuana with on \nthe trips to Las Vegas and Seattle.\u201d He indicated that he is fully aware of his obligations to \nthe United States while working with a clearance and that he would abstain from any use of \nany controlled substances. (AE A.) \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under Federal law pursuant to 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 812. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high potential for abuse; have no \ncurrently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and lack accepted safety \nfor use of the drug under medical supervision. On October 25, 2014, the then DNI issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing Federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of Federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDespite some states\u2019 legalization or decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana \nfor recreational use, marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance, and its use is \nillegal under Federal law and contrary to the obligations of security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant reported on his SF 86 that he used marijuana on a few occasions between June \n2013 and August 2018. During his OPM interview, he provided no details about his \nreported use before 2017. He admitted at that time that he used marijuana with his wife \nand a friend in his home in 2017; with this friend on trips to Las Vegas and Seattle in 2018; \nand once in his home in 2018. His illegal use of marijuana establishes disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse.\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d is shown only in that Applicant had \nphysical possession of marijuana when he used it. There is no information in the record \nabout how Applicant acquired the marijuana that he used. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position,\u201d Applicant denies that he used marijuana while \nhe held a security clearance or was being sponsored for a clearance by his employer. \nAvailable information (Item 4) reflects that Applicant was granted a Secret clearance by the \nDOD CAF on August 26, 2014. He provided no documentation showing that his clearance \neligibility was withdrawn, but there is also no conclusive evidence that he used marijuana \nwhile he held a sensitive position or had access to classified information. Applicant \nresigned from the position where he held clearance eligibility in January 2017. He asserts \nwithout any evidence to the contrary that his duties were in the commercial sector from \nJanuary 2017 to June 2017. Some of his duties as a penetration tester with his next \nemployer from June 2017 to February 2018 were for a U.S.-government entity, yet it was \nnot clearly established that he held a sensitive position that required clearance eligibility. \nWhen Applicant used marijuana in 2018, he was working for a company that he asserts \nhad no government contracts to his knowledge, and his clients were in the commercial \nsector. There is no evidence that he has used marijuana since commencing his \nemployment in October 2018 with the company currently sponsoring him for security \nclearance eligibility. The evidence falls short of establishing AG \u00b6 25(f). \nEven so, Applicant knew or can reasonably be held to have known that his \nmarijuana use was against Federal law. He had served honorably in the U.S. military and \nworked for contractors in service of U.S.-government entities. He responded affirmatively \non his SCA to having used marijuana illegally. He did not present any evidence of his \nemployer\u2019s policy regarding the use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s decision to forego future \nmarijuana use, which he expressed on his SF 86, during his interview, in response to the \nSOR, and in rebuttal to the FORM, is viewed favorably, but it does not necessarily dispel \nthe security concerns raised by his drug involvement in knowing contravention of Federal \nlaw. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 26 \nprovides for mitigation as follows: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) cannot reasonably apply in mitigation. Applicant\u2019s marijuana involvement \nto at least August 2018 was very recent as of his December 2018 SCA. Neither AG \u00b6 26(c) \nnor AG \u00b6 26(d) was shown to apply. Applicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n26(b) (3) because of the passage of more than two years since his last use of marijuana, \nand his intention to forego any future involvement. While I did not have the opportunity to \nassess Applicant\u2019s demeanor in person, his disclosure on his SCA of then very recent \nmarijuana use weighs in his favor in assessing whether his stated intention to refrain from \nusing marijuana while holding a DOD security clearance can be accepted as credible. His \ncandor about his drug involvement is not in and of itself mitigating of his illegal marijuana \nuse. However, his self-report of negative information that could cost him clearance \neligibility is important evidence of compliance with DOD requirements. \nSome concern arises because of the limited information in the record about the \ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. Applicant did not indicate how he came to \npossess the marijuana that he used, although it is also not clear that the OPM investigator \nasked him. Applicant told the investigator that he used marijuana in his home in 2017 with \nhis wife and friend X; in 2018 in Las Vegas and Seattle with friend X; and in 2018 at his \nhome.

In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant stated that he has \ndisassociated himself from \u201cthose whom [he] used marijuana with on the trips to Las Vegas \nand Seattle.\u201d Presumably, he was referring to friend X, although in that regard, he did not \nexplain when he ended their association other than that it occurred \u201csince working for [his \ncurrent employer].\u201d Friend X was involved in Applicant\u2019s drug use in 2017 and 2018, but so \nwas Applicant\u2019s wife. Too many unanswered questions exist about her role in Applicant\u2019s \ndrug use to apply either AG \u00b6 26(b) (1) or AG \u00b6 26(b) (2). \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was too intermittent to support the Government\u2019s \ncharacterization of a longstanding history of marijuana use over many years, before and \nafter obtaining a Secret-level security clearance. That being said, even his limited \ninvolvement was in disregard of Federal law. It occurred when Applicant was in his mid to \nlate 30s, so immaturity was no excuse. His motivation for using marijuana is unclear, and \nhis drug use in violation of Federal law is difficult to reconcile with his record of decorated \nmilitary service and his subsequent contractor employment in support of U.S. - government \nentities. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). The Government \nmust be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility to fulfill their \nresponsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies. For the reasons previously \ndiscussed, doubts persist as to whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Finding \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

(Answer.) The Government was ready to proceed on \nDecember 14, 2020. The case was assigned to me on January 14, 2021. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 21, 2021. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on February 10, 2021.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 1, \n2021. Applicant requested the record remain open for receipt of additional information. \nOn February 24, 2021, Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibits A through E, which were \nalso admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant is 61 years old and married. Applicant has a high school education and \nis employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Tool Builder. This is Applicant\u2019s first \napplication for a security clearance.

He testified that he \nhad filed these returns, but did not have sufficient money to pay the taxes. He is also \nbeginning to work with a tax professional to file all of his back taxes. (Applicant Exhibits \nA through D; Tr. 23, 26-28.) \nTurning to the general consumer debts, SOR 1.d to 1.h. Support for the existence \nand amount of these debts is found in the credit report in the record dated March 2, 2019. \n(Government Exhibit 5.) The debts total $3,550. Applicant also admitted the existence of \nthese debts in his Answer and in an interview with an investigator with the Office of \nPersonnel Management on April 9, 2019. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant testified that \nhe believed these are all his debts, he has not paid them, but he hopes to do so in the \nfuture. (Tr. 18-21.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted a letter of recommendation from his supervisor. In his letter, \nthis person stated that Applicant is \u201cdependable, responsible, and honest.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibit E.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns, as required, for \ntax years 2011 through 2017. He owes a considerable amount in back taxes, interest and \npenalties. He also had unpaid consumer debts. These facts establish prima facie support \nfor the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthose concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns, pay his taxes, or his \npast-due consumer debts: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant admitted that he has been extremely delinquent in filing his tax returns, \npaying his taxes, or attempting to resolve his past-due consumer debts. None of those \nissues are resolved. There is some evidence that Applicant has begun the work to file \nand resolve his back taxes. However, there is little track record of Applicant resolving his \ndebts. Applicant did not mitigate the concerns over his income tax or consumer debt \nissues. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that he has resolved his tax and debt issues, or is likely to do \nso in the foreseeable future. If Applicant is successful in resolving these concerns over \nan extended period of time he may become eligible for national security eligibility. The \npotential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the evidence \ncreates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. He failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on April 1, 2019. On \nOctober 16, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines G, J, and E. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 27, 2020, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing.

He \nreceived the FORM on December 10, 2020, and did not submit a response. The DOHA \ntransmittal letter and receipt are marked as Administrative Exhibit 1. The case was \nassigned to me on February 11, 2021.  \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2014 for driving \nwhile intoxicated (DWI), pled guilty and was convicted in January 2016. His sentence \nincluded 15 months\u2019 probation. He participated in treatment from December 2017 to \nJanuary 2018 following a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Applicant was arrested in \nMarch 2018 and charged with DWI, second offense. He pled guilty and was convicted in \nJanuary 2019. His sentence included 180 days confinement, suspended, and 15 months\u2019 \nprobation. He was evaluated in March 2019 and diagnosed with moderate alcohol use \ndisorder in early partial remission. Applicant was advised to abstain from all mood altering \nchemicals, including alcohol. Applicant admits each of these allegations. Applicant stated \nin his answer that he also participated in treatment from April 2018 until June 2018. The \ntwo DWI arrests are cross alleged under Guideline J. Applicant admits the Guideline J \nallegation. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified material \nfacts on his 2012 and 2014 e-QIPs by failing to disclose that he had illegally used \nmarijuana from May 2004 until 2012. Applicant admits the two allegations under Guideline \nE. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant, 35, is a trade compliance specialist employed by a defense contractor \nsince August 2016. He worked for another defense contractor from April 2013 until August \n2016. He received his associate\u2019s degree in 2007 and his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He \nmarried in 2015 and he and his wife have two children. He was previously granted a \nsecurity clearance in February 2014. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nIn response to DOHA\u2019s June 2020 interrogatories, which stated that records \nobtained in Applicant\u2019s background investigation revealed past illegal-drug use and asked \nApplicant to describe his marijuana use, Applicant disclosed that he first used marijuana \nin May 2004 and last used it in 2012 with a frequency of less than once a month. He did \nnot disclose this use on his 2012 and 2014 e-QIPs as required. (GX 4; GX 3.) The record \ndoes not contain any explanation by Applicant regarding his falsifications. \nIn May 2014, while holding a security clearance, Applicant consumed eight or nine \nbeers over approximately three hours with his then girlfriend now wife at her home. They \ngot into an argument and Applicant left with the intention of dropping to his parents\u2019 house. \nHe was pulled over for speeding and ultimately arrested for DWI with a blood alcohol \ncontent of .13. In approximately January 2016 he pled guilty to DWI and was sentenced \nto 15 months of supervised probation, 70 hours of community service, a fine of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napproximately $1,000, and required to pay the state DWI surcharge of $800 a year for \nthree years. He was also required to attend alcohol awareness classes. He underwent a \ncourt-ordered alcohol abuse evaluation and the evaluator did not recommend treatment. \nIn December 2017, Applicant voluntarily entered an alcohol treatment program where he \nwas diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. He participated in the program for 30 days. (GX \n4.) \nIn March 2018, Applicant was drinking beer at home, argued with his wife, and got \nin his car and drove away. He was pulled over for speeding and ultimately arrested for \nDWI with a blood alcohol content of .08. In January 2019, he pled guilty to DWI and was \nsentenced to 180 days in jail, suspended, 15 months\u2019 supervised probation which \nincluded random alcohol and drug screening, 60 hours of community service, court costs \nand fines of $850, and the state DWI surcharge of $800 for three years. (GX 4.) He was \nstill on probation when he underwent his 2019 background investigation. \nIn April 2018, Applicant again voluntarily entered an alcohol abuse treatment \nprogram at the same facility. He successfully completed a 60-day program in June 2018 \nand Applicant asserts that has maintained sobriety since completing the program and that \nhe regularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. (GX 4; GX 3.) However, he did not \nsubmit any substantiating evidence of his continued abstinence. \nApplicant again underwent a court-ordered alcohol-abuse evaluation in March \n2019 and was diagnosed with moderate alcohol use disorder in early partial remission. \nThe evaluator made the following recommendations: that Applicant remain abstinent from \nall mood altering chemicals to include alcohol; that Applicant undergo random drug \nscreening; and that Applicant participate in a 30-hour DWI intervention course for repeat \nDWI offenders. The evaluator did not recommend treatment unless evidence indicated \nthat Applicant was using alcohol or illegal drugs or abusing prescription medication, in \nwhich case he should be required to participate in intensive outpatient treatment. (GX 4.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder; \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant was arrested for DWI in 2014 while holding a security clearance and \nconvicted of the offense in January 2016. His sentence included 15 months\u2019 supervised \nprobation and required attendance of alcohol awareness classes. He voluntarily entered \na 30-day treatment program in December 2017 and was diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. Despite his diagnosis and treatment, Applicant continued to abuse alcohol. He \nwas again arrested for DWI in March 2018 and was convicted of the offense in January \n2019. He was sentenced, in part, to 15 months\u2019 supervised probation which included \nrandom alcohol and drug screening, and to 180 days in jail, suspended. He returned to \nthe same treatment facility and successfully completed a 60-day program in June 2018. \nApplicant states that he has been sober since completing the program and that he \nregularly attends AA meetings. His March 2019 evaluation of moderate alcohol use \ndisorder in early partial remission supports Applicant\u2019s assertion of practicing abstinence \nfrom alcohol. \nThere are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the \nevidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n5 \n\n \n \n \nIn considering the totality of the evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s 2018 arrest \nfor DWI use was recent and casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Further, while Applicant asserted, and his March 2019 evaluation \nsupported, that he was maintaining sobriety at that time, there is no record evidence \nregarding his current alcohol use. Applicant remained on supervised probation during his \n2019 background investigation. The probation included random alcohol screening. \nApplicant was subject to 180 days\u2019 incarceration if he violated the terms of his probation. \nThe possibility of incarceration may have served as a motivating factor for Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence. Although Applicant successfully completed a 60-day treatment program, he \npreviously relapsed after participating in treatment. While Applicant is to be commended \nfor his efforts to manage his alcohol use disorder, his recent alcohol-related arrest and \nprevious relapse after treatment combined with the absence of any record evidence of \nongoing sobriety leave me with doubts about Applicant\u2019s current security clearance \nworthiness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(d) apply. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nI have considered the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 and 2018 DWI arrests and convictions constitute criminal conduct \nas anticipated by this guideline. While there is evidence of rehabilitation and that Applicant \ncomplied with the terms of his two periods of supervised probation, the 2018 arrest and \nsubsequent conviction is too recent to be mitigated by time. Applicant has not mitigated \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe concern under this guideline. I have more thoroughly evaluated his conduct under \nGuideline G, as set forth above. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. The following \nwill normally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nApplicant admits that he intentionally falsified material facts on his 2012 and 2014 \ne-QIPs. He does not offer any explanation for the falsifications. He did not disclose his \nillegal drug use until confronted with the information in 2020. His falsifications and lack of \ncandor cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s false statements and omissions about \nmaterial facts raise concerns that he might not be forthcoming about future potentially \nderogatory conduct such as alcohol consumption. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns under this guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, J, \nand E and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole-person factors set forth \nin AG \u00b6 2(a), I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nconduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He earned four master\u2019s degrees in 2011, 2012 (2), and \n2013.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f). \nThe remaining debts include a municipal government lien (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and consumer \ncollection accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e, and 1.g). Applicant admitted to all of the SOR \ndebts with explanations. \nApplicant and his spouse purchased a home in 2013 while maintaining another \nhome that they operated as a rental property. While under pressure to maintain two \nmortgages and family expenses, they began to accumulate debts. In 2018, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse lost income due to reduced work hours and they lost a tenant in their rental \nproperty. These events caused substantial financial difficulties. In 2019, several credit \ncards became delinquent and some judgments were entered against Applicant. During \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, Applicant\u2019s spouse lost several months of work while her school \nwas closed, resulting in a short-term loss of household income. \nApplicant began addressing his debts through negotiations with his creditors in \n2019. The largest debt, a mortgage judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a), was restructured with the new \nlender, and Applicant made regular monthly payments under the plan. By March 2021, \nApplicant had completed the modification plan and is now current on the mortgage with \nno late payments. This debt is resolved. \nSOR debts \u00b6 1.b is a judgment that was satisfied in November 2020; SOR \u00b6 1.c \nwas satisfied in August 2020; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f and 1.g are expected to be paid by April \nto June 2021. Applicant has been working with the creditors, but due to his spouse\u2019s \nshort-term loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he has not completed resolving \nthese debts. These debts are satisfied or are in proceeding toward a satisfactory \nresolution. \nApplicant noted the lessons learned from being financially overextended and is \nnow in a better financial position.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient to \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good- faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d (internal citation \nand footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nApplicant incurred financial delinquencies through stresses on household finances \ndue to reduced household income from his spouse\u2019s loss of work hours, and difficulties \nfrom the ownership of rental property while maintaining their home mortgage and \nexpenses. Applicant made significant efforts to work with his creditors, pay off judgments, \nand renegotiate significant debts to bring his mortgage current. The remaining debts are \non their way toward being satisfied this year. \nOverall, Applicant made significant efforts to resolve his debts once he was \nfinancially secure. I am convinced Applicant now makes good financial decisions, and his \nfinancial status no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I do not believe that further financial problems are likely to recur as Applicant \nreduced spending and now diligently addresses financial problems when they arise. He \nbetter understands how to discuss financial difficulties with his creditors and has a long-\nstanding employment record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his debts once he was financially secure. Applicant provided \nsufficient evidence to show reasonable resolutions of the SOR debts and overall financial \nresponsibility. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or continue \neligibility for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is granted. \nGregg A.

The case was assigned to me on July 16, \n2021. Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a through 1.i with \nexplanations. She stated that the SOR accounts were settled in 2019 and 2020, as part \nof a debt relief program. (Item 2) She is 49-years-old, divorced with two adult children. \nShe received her GED in 1994, and attended college classes in 2009-2010, and in 2018 \nuntil the present, but she did not obtain an undergraduate degree. She has no prior \nmilitary experience. She has worked as a contractor for a defense company since 2008, \nand in April 2020, she received a promotion to her current position of Program Manager. \n(Item A) Applicant obtained a security clearance in 2007 for another agency, but was \ndenied a DOD security clearance in 2016 based on financial issues. (Item 3) She \nclaimed that she was granted a secret clearance on February 26, 2019, but provided no \nproof. (Item A) She completed her latest security clearance application on April 10, \n2019. (Item 3) \nFinancial \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has nine (9) delinquent debts totaling $30,766. \n(Item 1) The largest delinquent account was a charged-off-account for a consolidation \nloan for SOR 1.a in the amount of $9,538. (Item 1) The allegations are supported by her \ncredit report and security clearance application. (Item 3, 6) \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to a number of difficulties and problems \nbeginning in 2008 and continuing through 2017. In July 2008, her spouse ended their \nrelationship, and her income dropped from two incomes to one income. She was a \nsingle parent with two children, a mortgage, and two car payments. In 2008, she was \nresiding in Texas, but was offered a promotion which required her to move from Texas \nto Virginia. (Item A) Applicant took out a loan to help with housing placement, and \nmoving expenses from Texas to Virginia, and additional costs. (Item A, Response to \nFORM) In addition, in 2010, Applicant\u2019s former spouse was diagnosed with cancer and \nshe provided some care for him. In remission, he decided to abandon Applicant in 2012, \nand provided no financial support to her. (Item A, Response to FORM) \nApplicant enrolled in a debt relief program in October 2018, so that she could \nwork toward eliminating debt and regain control of her finances. She has copies of the \nagreement letters for each account and charts and documents that provide settlement \ndates and completion amounts. She has consistently made payments to this debt \nconsolidation program since April 2020. (Item 7) The supporting documentation shows \nthese payments totaled about $8,033 over the past year. (Item 7) In her response to \nFORM (Item A), Applicant claimed she has paid approximately $16,000 toward her debt \nconsolidation since October 2018. However, there is no specific documentation in the \nfile to support this. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.a, Applicant settled a \u201ccharged-off-account that was $9,538 in the \namount of $8,290.

(Item 2) \nAs to SOR 1.f, a charged-off-account in 2020, in the amount of $1,320, Applicant \nsettled the account in the amount of $536, and provided a letter from the company. \n(Attachment to answer to SOR) \nAs to SOR 1.g, a charged-off account in the amount of $1,020, Applicant settled \nthe account in 2020 for $459.33, and provided general documentation not connected to \na specific creditor. \nAs to SOR 1.h, a collection account in the amount of $1,035, Applicant settled \nthe account for $517.59, and provided general documentation not connected to a \nspecific creditor. \nAs to SOR 1.i, a charged-off account in 2019, in the amount of $1,527, Applicant \nsettled the account in the amount of $687.29, and provided general documentation not \nconnected to a specific creditor. \nCounsel does not dispute that Applicant provided her payment history with the \ndebt relief company showing that she consistently made payments to this debt \nconsolidation program since 2020. (Item 7) Her supporting documentation shows that \nthese payments totaled about $8,033 over the past year. (Item 7) Applicant provided \ndocuments that showed she had resolved eleven (11) delinquent financial accounts \nthrough the debt relief program. Counsel does not dispute this statement. As shown \nabove, each account was settled for less than the full amount owed in delinquency. \n(Item 8) \nHowever, in her April 4, 2019 security clearance application, Applicant admitted \nthat she had significant financial issues totaling over $30,000. She had been denied a \nsecurity clearance based on financial issues in 2016, but did not enroll in the debt \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsolidation until 2018.

(Answer to Response to FORM) \nCredit bureau report, dated April 20, 2021 (Item 4) shows \u201cpays as agreed\u201d or \nsettled for less than original balance for each account, with zero balance due. She has \nno other delinquent accounts on that credit bureau reports. (Item 4 Credit bureau report, \ndated April 25, 2019, (Item 6) shows past-due-amounts for various SOR accounts and \naccounts that are \u201ccharged off\u201d. \nPayments in various amounts are listed to the debt consolidation company from \nNovember 2020 until March 2021. (Item 7) Again, in (Item 8) a chart lists the agreement \namounts but does not show which creditor was paid. In her defense, Applicant did ask \nfor such a document, but did not receive anything. (Item 8) \nApplicant has been gainfully employed since 2008 and received various \npromotions. There is no information in the record concerning her salary, use of a \nfinancial counselor, budget or income. \n Policies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially debt burdened may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her earlier credit report, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \n19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that she was responsible for the delinquent debts and blames \nthe debts on various challenges. She has received no financial counseling. There is no \ninformation on her income, or how each debt originated, and whether she paid anything \non the accounts before the consolidation. Applicant has a history of financial issues \nsince 2008. She was denied a clearance in 2016 for financial issues. When she applied \nin 2019 for a security clearance she had about $30,000 worth of debt. \nApplicant did not provide a clear nexus between her divorce and her inability to \nmake any payments on accounts. In 2020, she made arrangements with a debt \nconsolidation firm and made consistent payments. However, she continues to \nmismanage her financial affairs. Her recent use of more debt \u2013 the consolidation loan to \nresolve her debts does not deserve full mitigation. This is based on the timing and her \nprior use of debt consolidation. She has not had financial counseling. It is difficult to say \nthat she has resolved the underlying issues for her clearance denial in 2016. Without \nmore information, I have doubts about her future ability to control her finances. Any \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. Applicant receives partial credit \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d). \nBased on the lack of evidence of specific debt resolution produced by Applicant, \nit is not a favorable conclusion of her making a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve her \ndebts, or that her financial situation is under control. The Government has cause to \nquestion whether Applicant has her finances under control at this time due to lack of \ninformation. Despite gainful employment since 2008, there is no evidence that Applicant \nhas met her evidentiary burden and none of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Any \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \n6 \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of this adjudication, any remaining doubts must \nbe resolved by denying Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. (Tr. 10.) The SOR under allegation 1.b states that Applicant has a sister-in-law who is a citizen and resident in Iraq. Applicant states that through an inadvertent error he did not list on Government Exhibit 1 at Section 18 that he actually also has a sister who is a citizen and resident of Iraq. Allegation 1.b was amended to comport with the facts by substituting \u201csister\u201d for \u201csister-in-law,\u201d pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive. (Tr. 28-29, 43-47.) Findings of Fact Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old, divorced, and has one child. He is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his proposed overseas 3 employment with a defense contractor.

Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Edmunds Law Firm \nJuly 7, 2021 \nDecision \nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge: \nBased on a review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns related to foreign influence raised by the presence \nof his family members in Iraq. His request for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 10, 2019. (Government Exhibit 1.) On September 11, 2020, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline \nB (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \n\n \n2 \n \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 9, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on January 5, 2021. The case was assigned to me on January 27, 2021. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January \n27, 2021, scheduling the hearing for March 3, 2021. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The Government also submitted Hearing Exhibit I for Administrative \nNotice. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through \nQ, which were also admitted without objection. Applicant requested that the record \nremain open for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant Exhibits R through T \nwere received in a timely manner and admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 16, 2021. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq). Department Counsel provided a \nseven-page summary of the facts, supported by thirteen Government documents \npertaining to Iraq, identified as Hearing Exhibit I. The documents provide elaboration \nand context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the \nU.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject \nto reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. (Tr. 10.) \n \n \nThe SOR under allegation 1.b states that Applicant has a sister-in-law who is a \ncitizen and resident in Iraq. Applicant states that through an inadvertent error he did not \nlist on Government Exhibit 1 at Section 18 that he actually also has a sister who is a \ncitizen and resident of Iraq. Allegation 1.b was amended to comport with the facts by \nsubstituting \u201csister\u201d for \u201csister-in-law,\u201d pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive. (Tr. 28-29, \n43-47.) \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old, divorced, and has one child. He is applying for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his proposed overseas \n\n \n3 \n \nemployment with a defense contractor. This is his first application for a security \nclearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 37-38, 42-43.) \n \n Paragraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq in 1983. He has two brothers, who currently live in the \nUnited States and are naturalized American citizens. His parents, sister, ex-wife, and \neight-year-old son are all citizens and residents of Iraq. (Government Exhibit 1 at \nSections 17 and 18; Applicant Exhibit I.) \n \n \nApplicant went to college in Iraq, graduating with a degree in engineering in \n2005. From 2006 through early 2012 Applicant worked for various private contractors \nsupporting American forces in Iraq. Applicant primarily worked in the Green Zone and \non other bases. Occasionally he came under mortar fire during his time working for the \nAmerican forces. Applicant immigrated to the United States in 2012 under a special visa \nprogram for Iraqis who had worked with American forces. Applicant became an \nAmerican citizen on April 20, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Applicant \nExhibits C, E, and H; Tr. 18-19, 32-36.) \n \n \nApplicant received a Master\u2019s degree in Engineering from a major American \nuniversity in 2015. He has worked as a civil engineer in the Public Works Department of \na mid-size American city since 2018. He makes a good salary at his job, enabling him to \npay all of his bills in a timely fashion. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Applicant \nExhibits A, B, F, G, J, and K; Tr. 19-21, 31, 36.) \n \n \n  As stated, Applicant\u2019s parents, son and sister are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nNone of them have connections to the Iraqi government. Applicant has been working for \nseveral years to have these people immigrate to the United States. None of them \ncurrently have permission to relocate to the United States. Processing of the petitions \nfor the immigration of his family stopped in 2017, pursuant to the actions of the United \nStates Government. Just recently the processing may have begun again. (Applicant \nExhibits L, M, R, S, and T; Tr. 17-18, 22, 25, 38-39, 50-51.) \n \n \nApplicant was in regular contact with his parents and son before he was issued \nthe SOR in September 2020. Since that time he has cut off communication with his \nfamily. Applicant has no contact with his ex-wife. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 26-29, 31.) \n \n \nApplicant has both an active American passport and active Iraqi passport. He \nused his Iraqi passport in preference to his American passport when he traveled to Iraq \nin 2017, 2018, and 2019. Applicant inadvertently left off of his e-QIP the fact that he had \ntraveled to Iraq in 2019. Applicant stated on the e-QIP, \u201cI only used the Iraqi passport \nwhen I enter my country to avoid the visa fee.\u201d (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 10 \nand 20C, Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 23-25, 38-42.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he would not do anything to harm the United States. He \nfurther stated that his loyalty lies, \u201cAbsolutely America.\u201d (Tr. 30.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant has been a successful employee at his current employment. His annual \nevaluations show him to be a talented and diligent engineer. (Applicant Exhibits A, F, \nand G.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted several letters of recommendation from people who know \nhim on a personal and professional level. Applicant Exhibit D contains three letters. The \nfirst two are from friends. The third is from a colleague who worked with Applicant in \nIraq. The Applicant is described as \u201can excellent, intelligent and articulate Engineer.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant Exhibit P contains an additional letter of recommendation from another \nwork colleague of Applicant in Iraq, who worked for the U.S. military for many years. \nThe letter writer states, \u201c[My] sincere opinion that there was no better former Iraqi \nEngineer to support and trust with a US Security Clearance, and to entrust with further \nmissions in his former region.\u201d \n \nIraq \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (Hearing Exhibit I: \nAttachments.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother, son, and sister live in Iraq. Applicant is divorced from \nhis now ex-wife. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nIraq has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate openly and \ncontrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country \nhave the potential to generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The mere possession of close \nfamily ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant is a proud and loyal American citizen. He has been successful in the \nUnited States both academically and professionally. Applicant\u2019s two brothers live in the \nUnited States and are also American citizens. He has financial connections to the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. \n \nApplicant currently has minimal contact with his family members who live in Iraq. \nHowever, AG \u00b6 8(c) does not fully apply because he was in extensive contact with his \nfamily members before issuance of the SOR. \n \nApplicant was involved in assisting American forces as an engineer for six years \nat several overseas locations. There is some indication that he was under fire at various \ntimes. It is also noted that he was extensively involved with assisting American forces at \na time when he was not an American citizen, which was supported by letters of \nrecommendation from American co-workers. While that fact is not normally to be \nconsidered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. \n05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) the following: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the national security. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \n\n \n8 \n \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s family lives in Iraq, \nparticularly his son. He obviously loves his family and is hoping to have them immigrate \nto the United States. In this particular case, I find that Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity significance arising from their presence for the following reasons. He has \nserved U.S. national interests with pride and exceptional ability during his time \noverseas, when he was not an American citizen. Applicant is a successful engineer with \na strong family presence in the United States in the persons of his two brothers. He has \nstrong letters of recommendation from people who worked with him in Iraq. Applicant \nhas completely mitigated the security significance of the presence of his family \nmembers in Iraq. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the pertinent guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Iraq. Since 2012 he has lived full time in the \nUnited States, working and attended school in order to advance himself. Applicant has \nshown himself to be a talented and patriotic American. He can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States due to his sense of loyalty to the \nUnited States.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comment, all of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: 2 Background Applicant is a 30-year-old independent subcontractor of a defense contractor. He has been serving in logistics with his current sponsor since September 2019. He previously served in a variety of full-time or part-time positions with the Army National Guard (ANG) as an inactive reservist, a temporary technician, and a dual status federal technician. His most recent grade was that of sergeant (E-5). A 2009 high school graduate, he continued his education, earning credits, but to date, he has not received a degree. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, for in his SF 86 he denied ever receiving one, but Department Counsel asserted, without documentary verification, that he had been granted a clearance in 2008. He was married in 2017. He has two children, born in 2018 and 2020. Financial Considerations General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated October 27, 2017); Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 20, 2019); and Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dat",

Corrales, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/18/2021 \nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding Financial Considerations. \nEligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 27, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On May 31, 2019, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn September 9, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 30, 2020, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on January 13, 2021. His response was due on February 12, 2021. Applicant \ntimely responded to the FORM, and he submitted a statement and several documents, to \nwhich there was no objection. The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2021. \nUpon reviewing the case file, especially Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, it was \nnoted that while Applicant claimed to have submitted descriptions of \u201cactions taken to \nremediate delinquencies\u201d as well as \u201cdocumentary evidence demonstrating mitigation\u201d, \nthe information described consists merely of Applicant\u2019s reported actions unsupported by \ndocumentation. Applicant referred to confirmation numbers associated with claimed \npayments, but he failed to submit documentation such as bank registers, bank \nstatements, or receipts or statements from the creditors, or more recent credit reports. \nSince I was aware that the website for DOHA had been down for various periods, \nthus possibly limiting Applicant\u2019s understanding of what constitutes necessary \ndocumentation, in order to afford him a fair opportunity to address the issues present in \nthis case, on March 8, 2021, I issued a Case Management Order, reopening this matter \nfor the limited purpose to enable him to submit the documentation that will support his \ncontentions that the payments have been made, and that the accounts have been \nresolved. Applicant timely submitted several documents to support his contentions that \nhe contacted his creditors, and that he had made payments to most of his creditors. In \nthe absence of objections by the Government, those documents have been marked as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A and AE B, and accepted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comment, all of the SOR \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings \nof fact: \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBackground \nApplicant is a 30-year-old independent subcontractor of a defense contractor. He \nhas been serving in logistics with his current sponsor since September 2019. He \npreviously served in a variety of full-time or part-time positions with the Army National \nGuard (ANG) as an inactive reservist, a temporary technician, and a dual status federal \ntechnician. His most recent grade was that of sergeant (E-5). A 2009 high school \ngraduate, he continued his education, earning credits, but to date, he has not received a \ndegree. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance, for in his SF 86 he denied \never receiving one, but Department Counsel asserted, without documentary verification, \nthat he had been granted a clearance in 2008. He was married in 2017. He has two \nchildren, born in 2018 and 2020. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated October 27, 2017); Item 5 \n(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 20, 2019); \nand Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 22, 2020. \nApplicant reported that he was unemployed from November 2013 until January \n2014, but that was not the focus of his financial difficulties. He noted that during the period \n2017 until 2019, several factors contributed to his financial problems: his wife stopped \nworking upon becoming pregnant; she subsequently remained home to care for their \nchild; and his financial situation became very inconsistent when he was with the ANG \nwhen there were periods of insufficient funding to keep him in a settled or paid routine. A \nnumber of accounts became delinquent due to his inability to keep them in a current \nstatus. Applicant referred to unspecified district court activities associated with several of \nthe accounts, but it remains unclear if any of those actions resulted in judgments against \nhim. As a result of his increasing financial burden, he purportedly sought the assistance \nof a debt-resolution company. It remains unclear what services, if any, that company \nperformed for him for Applicant failed to submit any documentation to support his claim. \nIn February 2021, he also obtained a debt-consolidation loan, in the amount of \n$20,000, to enable him to address his debts. (AE A (Experian Credit Report, dated March \n12, 2021, at 5)) However, as noted by Department Counsel, it is unclear if Applicant has \nyet made any monthly payments on the loan as, once again, he failed to submit any \ndocumentation other than a monthly budget to indicate that payments are being made. \nThe SOR alleged four delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,785, as set \nforth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $2,523 that was \ncharged off in March 2019, after being 120 days past due. (Item 5, at 8; Item 4, at 2; Item \n3, at 52-53; Extract of Equifax Credit Report, attached to Response to the FORM) In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation without comment, but in his \nResponse to the FORM, he claimed he paid off the creditor in February 2021 and resolved \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe account. He subsequently submitted a recent credit report that reported the account \nstatus as \u201cpaid, was a charge-off.\u201d (AE A, at 11) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $4,491 that was \ncharged off in April 2019, after being 120 days past due. (Item 5, at 8; Item 4, at 3; Item \n3, at 54-55; Extract of Equifax Credit Report, attached to Response to the FORM) In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation without comment, but in his \nResponse to the FORM, he claimed that his efforts to address the account with the \ncollection agent were rebuffed because it was no longer the holder of the account, and \nthey are pending an assignment to a \u201crecoupment company.\u201d While the account remains \nunresolved, Applicant is credited with attempting to resolve it. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $4,522 that was \ncharged off in August 2018, after being 120 days past due. (Item 5, at 8; Item 4, at 3; Item \n3, at 53-54; Extract of Equifax Credit Report, attached to Response to the FORM) In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation without comment, but in his \nResponse to the FORM, he claimed he paid off the creditor in February 2021 and resolved \nthe account. He subsequently submitted a recent credit report that reported the account \nstatus as \u201cpaid, was a charge-off.\u201d (AE A, at 15) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $13,249 \nthat was charged off in December 2017, after being 120 days past due. (Item 5, at 9; Item \n4, at 3; Extract of Equifax Credit Report, attached to Response to the FORM) In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation without comment, but in his \nResponse to the FORM, he claimed he paid off the creditor in February 2021 and resolved \nthe account. He subsequently submitted a recent credit report that reported the account \nstatus as \u201cpaid, was a charge-off.\u201d (AE A, at 18) The account has been resolved. \nIt is noted that despite Applicant\u2019s claimed inability to maintain the accounts \nalleged in the SOR in a current status because of insufficient funds to do so, he managed \nto take three personal trips to visit his wife\u2019s family in Poland in 2017, 2018, and 2019 for \nvarying periods between 6-20 days. (Item 3, at 42-45). \nApplicant\u2019s Personal Monthly Budget reports $4,400 in current net monthly income; \n$3,513 in monthly expenses, including $829 for the consolidation loan; and a monthly \nremainder of $887 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. \n(Response to the FORM) There is no evidence of financial counseling. Based on his \ncurrent monthly budget, Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged four delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,785. \nApplicant claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain those accounts in a current \nstatus. In his Answer to the SOR, he admitted that as of the date the SOR was issued \n(September 11, 2020), the accounts were still delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) and \nhave been established. With regard to being unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of \nan ability to do so, the fact that he had spent money to take several trips to Poland during \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nhis period of reported insufficient funds, leads to a conclusion that AG \u00b6 19(b) has been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(d) fully or partially apply, but 20(c) does not apply. A \ndebt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant attributed his financial issues to a variety of factors: \nhis wife stopped working upon becoming pregnant; she subsequently remained home to \ncare for their child; and his financial situation became very inconsistent when he was with \nthe ANG when there were periods of insufficient funding to keep him in a settled or paid \nroutine. It is troubling that although Applicant claimed that he had insufficient funds to \nmaintain his accounts in a current status, he managed to take several personal trips to \nPoland in 2017, 2018, and 2019. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant seemingly ignored his delinquent \naccounts until five months after the SOR was issued. An applicant who begins to resolve \nhis financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance \nis in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and \nregulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. \n(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-\n00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant completed his SF 86 in October 2019; \nand the SOR was issued in September 2020. Those two steps of the security clearance \nreview process placed him on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting \nhim. He has made an unverified statement that he had previously resolved one non-SOR \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccount with one creditor. He also provided verified proof that he had resolved three of \nthe four SOR-related debts, but he delayed any verified resolution efforts regarding those \ndebts until February 2021. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant resolved three of the \nfour accounts alleged in the SOR, and his efforts with respect to the fourth account have \nbeen rebuffed by the collection agent. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s former financial difficulties, and \nhis general failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them until the SOR was issued, \nis sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. While the \ntimeliness of his efforts to resolve his debts is not good, the subsequent substantial \npositive and successful efforts are very good. His strong showing that most of the \naccounts are now resolved, or about to be resolved, along with the amount of money that \nis available for discretionary spending or savings each month, indicates that the financial \nproblems are substantially in the past. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nApplicant\u2019s delayed actions under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. His \nhistory of delinquent debt is documented in his earlier credit reports. The SOR alleged \nfour charged-off accounts totaling approximately $24,785. There is no evidence that \nApplicant made any attempts to resolve them until well after the SOR was issued. During \nthe period of his financial difficulties, he still managed to take several trips to Poland. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial, but still not exactly compelling. Applicant is a 30-year-old independent \nsubcontractor of a defense contractor. He has been serving in logistics with his current \nsponsor since September 2019. He previously served in a variety of full-time or part-time \npositions with the ANG as an inactive reservist, a temporary technician, and a dual status \nfederal technician. His most recent grade was that of sergeant (E-5). A 2009 high school \ngraduate, he continued his education, earning credits, but to date, he has not received a \ndegree. Department Counsel asserted that Applicant had been granted a clearance in \n2008. While Applicant offered no verifiable evidence that he had made efforts to resolve \nhis delinquent debts before the SOR was issued, he did subsequently submit \ndocumentation that supported his assertions that he has already resolved three of the \nfour debts alleged in the SOR. He continues to attempt resolution with the one remaining \ncreditor. His finances have improved to the point where he now has a monthly remainder \navailable for discretionary spending or savings. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s current track record, though delayed, is positive and encouraging, \nalthough it did not commence before the SOR was issued. This decision should serve as \na warning that Applicant\u2019s failure to more timely and aggressively resolve the one \nremaining debt for $4,491, or to make timely monthly loan-consolidation payments, may \nadversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance as security officials may \ncontinue to monitor his finances. The Government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial \nstatus at any time through credit reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a \nclearance now does not bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 11, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \na Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On September 22, 2020, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn October 15, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have her \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 2, 2020, and she was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on January 7, 2021. Her response was due on February 6, 2021. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of March 18, 2021, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on March 18, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the SOR allegations \npertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). Her comments with respect \nto both her admissions and her denials are incorporated herein. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a financial analyst with her current employer since February 2018. She previously \nserved as either a bookkeeper or financial analyst with other employers from September \n2010 until February 2018, except during a three-year period during 2014 through 2017, \nwhen she chose to be a stay-home mother and homemaker. A 2005 high school graduate, \nshe received an associate\u2019s degree in 2007. She has never served with the U.S. military. \nShe has never been granted a security clearance. She was married in 2014. She has two \nchildren, born in 2007 and 2014, as well as two step-children, born in 2009 and 2012. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated January 4, 2014); Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, \nand Equifax Credit Report, dated December 16, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, \ndated July 9, 2019); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated February 12, 2020); Item 8 \n(Equifax Credit Report, dated November 6, 2020); Item 9 (Enhanced Subject Interview, \ndated February 21, 2018, and February 27, 2018); and an undated TransUnion Credit \nReport, attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR. \nIn February 2018, during two interviews with an investigator from the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant initially claimed to be surprised that her \nstudent loans, opened between 2006 and 2010, were delinquent, because her father had \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nagreed to pay them. When she checked her credit report with Credit Karma, there was \nno indication that they were delinquent. She acknowledged that in 2014, she received a \ntelephone call with respect to the student loans, and after she described being an \nunemployed single parent, she was informed that her five student loans would be \ndeferred. After discussing the situation with her father, he advised her that two or three \nstudent loans were in his name, and he said he would bring them current. (Item 9, at 5-\n7) She also contended that her income tax refund, in the amount of $5,270, was being \nseized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and distributed to her outstanding student \nloans. (Item 9, at 6-7) At the end of her first interview, Applicant was given five days to \nprovide documentation or further information regarding her student loans. (Item 9, at 6) \nShe failed to submit any documentation, but did describe her discussion with her father \nas well as the IRS action. \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant revised her story. She contended that her \nparents informed her that her student loans were all paid, using a savings account they \nhad started for her when she was in high school. She claimed that they had never \nreceived any notices from the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) regarding the loans \nwhile residing at the same address for the past 30 years. (Item 2, at 1) She also stated \nthat she had contacted the DOE in September 2020, in order to obtain additional \ninformation on the open loans and to plan on a way to pay off her loans. She eventually \nsubmitted a Loan Rehabilitation Loan and Expense Form to establish a repayment plan, \nas well as a Loan Discharge Application: Unpaid Refund Form to dispute loans for classes \nshe never enrolled in. She contended that her requested actions would be completed \nwithin no more than 60 days from her applications. (Item 2, at 2) \nApplicant failed to submit any documents, such as the education savings account \npayments; copies of the two forms she claimed she submitted to the DOE; any documents \nfrom the DOE indicating deferment or forbearance actions; any documents from the IRS \nreflecting the seizure of an income tax refund; or any correspondence with the schools \nshe claimed had falsely submitted loan applications in her name for classes in which she \ndid not enroll. She has not claimed that payments have been made for any of the student \nloans since the SOR was issued. \nThe SOR alleged four delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, totaling \napproximately $27,619, as set forth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a $7,000 student loan with an unpaid balance increased to \n$12,650 that was initially granted by a lender, transferred to a servicing agent, and \neventually, upon being defaulted, returned to the DOE. (Item 4, at 6-8; Item 5, at 6, 9-10; \nItem 6, at 2; Item 7, at 2) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that the account \nremains delinquent. The account remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a $5,500 student loan with an unpaid balance increased to \n$8,126 that was initially granted by a lender, transferred to a servicing agent, and \neventually, upon being defaulted, returned to the DOE. (Item 5, at 6, 8-9; Item 6, at 2; \nItem 7, at 2) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that the account remains \ndelinquent. The account remains unresolved. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to a $4,500 student loan with an unpaid balance increased to \n$5,599 that was initially granted by a lender, transferred to a servicing agent, and \neventually, upon being defaulted, returned to the DOE. (Item 5, at 6, 9; Item 6, at 2; Item \n7, at 2) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the validity of the account. \nNevertheless, the account remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to a student loan with an unpaid balance increased to $1,244 \nthat was reportedly initially granted by a lender, transferred to a servicing agent, and \neventually, upon being defaulted, returned to the DOE. (Item 7, at 2) However, this \nparticular loan has the same account number reflected for the account set forth in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. The various credit reports do not indicate the original lender or servicing agent for the \nloan, and it is unclear if this is a portion of another loan or merely a mistake. In her Answer \nto the SOR, Applicant denied the validity of the account. Under the circumstances, the \nevidence does not support the allegation. \nApplicant did not report her current net monthly income, monthly expenses, or any \nmonthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is \nno evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of \nfinancial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a financial \nposition financially to cover her accounts, including her delinquent (defaulted) student \nloans. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged four delinquent student-loan accounts that were placed for \ncollection, totaling approximately $27,619. Although Applicant initially claimed that her \nstudent loans had been paid off by her father, she eventually retreated from that position, \nand conceded that she was in the process of working with the DOE in resolving her \naccounts. First there was a purported deferment, and then there was discussion about a \nrepayment plan. Applicant admitted that two of the student loans were still delinquent as \nof the date the SOR was issued. As of the date a potential Response to the FORM could \nbe made, she had not submitted documentary evidence to show that she had resolved, \nor attempted to resolve, any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) have been established. Instead of verifiably following through in attempting to \nresolve the accounts, or demonstrating through documentation that her father actually \npaid some of the loans, Applicant has relied on the arguments that some of the accounts \nare no longer in one of her most recent credit reports, or the loan was not valid. Her \ninaction over a substantial period supports a conclusion that she is unwilling to satisfy her \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so. AG \u00b6 19(c) has been established. Because of the \nlingering questions about the loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d., none of the conditions have \nbeen established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of the conditions apply. Applicant conceded that her student loans were \nopened between 2006 and 2010 \u2013 more than a decade ago. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, \nand her failure to voluntarily and timely resolve her delinquent accounts, make it rather \neasy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like \nit has been for several years. She attributed her financial problems to a variety of factors: \nher father agreed to pay for her loans; the DOE had never furnished either of them notice \nthat payments were not being made; and that she never enrolled in at least one of the \nschools that processed a student loan in her name. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nThat having been stated, there is still a substantial risk when one accepts, at face \nvalue, the contents of a credit report without obtaining original source documentation to \nverify entries. Credit bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including public \nrecords and \u201cother sources,\u201d and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause \nfor concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely \nchurned, an individual\u2019s credit history can look worse than it really is. In this particular \ninstance, the combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax credit reports referred to \nnumerous creditors for relatively few delinquent accounts. Because of abbreviated names \nand acronyms, and the absence of full or, in some instances, even partial account \nnumbers, many of those entries are garbled and redundant, and have inflated the financial \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nconcerns. The Equifax and TransUnion credit reports are of even less value. Even where \nthe OPM investigator has obtained some source information, in some instances, that \ninformation differs from what appears in the credit reports. In this instance, a single \nstudent loan was reported by the different credit reporting agencies multiple times using \nup to three different creditors, four different account numbers, and differing unpaid \nbalances. Connecting the dots where possible is difficult under the best of circumstances. \nApplicant has been both a financial analyst and a bookkeeper, but in this instance \nshe has not displayed any of the knowledge or strengths associated with those positions. \nInstead, she has seemingly \u201cjustified\u201d her inaction with regard to her delinquent student-\nloan accounts either because her father said he would take care of them \u2013 or had already \ntaken care of them; or that the DOE said it would take care of them; or because they are \nno longer reported on her credit report. She made no verifiable efforts to investigate or \nattempt to resolve either her acknowledged student loans or her disputed student loans. \nAs noted by Department Counsel, this \u201cdegree of ignorance . . . suggests an indifference \nto the proper satisfaction of legal obligations that draws into question [Applicant\u2019s] \nwillingness or capacity to comply with the sometimes complex rules governing the \nhandling and safeguarding of classified information.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 18-02914 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jan. 8, 2020)) \n\u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off . . . credit report is not meaningful evidence \nof debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. (Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission \nwebsite, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.) Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide a \nverifiable plan to resolve the delinquent student-loan accounts on her credit report, or \nthose no longer on her credit report, precludes mitigation of those debts in this case. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant intentionally chose to ignore her \ndelinquent accounts even after she was interviewed by OPM. An applicant who begins to \nresolve his or her financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her \nsecurity clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her \nown interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR \nCase No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant completed her SF 86 in \nDecember 2017; underwent her OPM interview in February 2018; and the SOR was \nissued in September 2020. Each step of the security clearance review process placed \nher on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting her. Other than her \nunverified claims that she had contacted her father, the DOE, and the IRS; had her \nincome tax refund seized and applied to her student loans; and intended to enter into a \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nrepayment plan with the DOE, she offered zero documentary evidence to support any of \nher claimed actions. \nIt should be noted that at the request of President Joseph Biden, on January 21, \n2021, the DOE Press Office issued a press release that the Acting Secretary of Education \nwill extend the pause on federal student loan payments and collections and keep the \ninterest rate at 0%. (https://www.gov/news/press-releases/request-president-biden\u00ad\nacting-secretary-education-will-extend-pause-federal-student-loan-payments) While this \naction places the delinquent student loans into a deferment status, it does not excuse \nApplicant\u2019s past inactions in the context of security clearance eligibility. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \ninformation regarding Applicant\u2019s net monthly income, monthly expenses, or the \nexistence of any remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings, \nher financial well-being is unknown. It remains difficult to determine why she has not \nverifiably attempted to resolve her delinquent student-loan accounts over the years, \nespecially after the significance of them in the security clearance eligibility process was \nmade known to her. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \nfinancial analyst with her current employer since February 2018. She previously served \nas either a bookkeeper or financial analyst with other employers from September 2010 \nuntil February 2018, except during a three-year period during 2014 through 2017, when \nshe chose to be a stay-home mother and homemaker. A 2005 high school graduate, she \nreceived an associate\u2019s degree in 2007. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has at least three delinquent student-loan accounts \n- opened between 2006 and 2010 - that were eventually placed for collection, totaling \napproximately $27,619. Although she initially claimed that her student loans had been \npaid off by her father, she eventually retreated from that position, and conceded that she \nwas in the process of working with the DOE in resolving her accounts. First there was a \npurported deferment, and then there was discussion about a repayment plan. Applicant \nadmitted that two of the student loans were still delinquent as of the date the SOR was \nissued. Instead of verifiably following through in attempting to resolve the accounts, or \ndemonstrating through documentation that her father actually paid some of the loans, \nApplicant has relied on the arguments that some of the accounts are no longer in one of \nher most recent credit reports, or the loan was not valid. She made no verifiable efforts to \ninvestigate or attempt to resolve either her acknowledged student loans or her disputed \nstudent loans. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record is extremely poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me \nwith substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n05/10/2021 \nDecision \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 28, 2018. On \nSeptember 30, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an undated answer to the SOR and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On December 11, 2020, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nincluding pleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 6. He \nreceived the FORM on January 7, 2021. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, and \nthe case was assigned to me on March 12, 2021. Items 1 through 6 are admitted into \nevidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 57 years old. He was married to his first wife from 1988 until they \ndivorced in 2011. They have a 30-year-old son and 21-year-old daughter. In 2013, \nApplicant married his second wife, and she has two sons. He has worked for defense \ncontractors for almost forty years, including his current employer since November 2000. \nHe is currently a design engineer principle. This is his second security clearance \napplication; he previously applied for and received a clearance in May 2001. (Item 2; Item \n3) \nApplicant admitted all the debts alleged in the SOR, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b (paid \nand removed from credit bureau report (CBR); 1.i and 1.j (disputes); and 1.m and 1.n \n(resolved). The alleged debts total $114,000 and became delinquent between 2016 and \n2018. (Items 1 \u2013 6) \nAccording to Applicant, his financial issues started in approximately 2011, during \nhis divorce. He was ordered to pay his ex-wife monthly alimony of $1,500 and $686 for \nhis daughter\u2019s child support. As of the date of the SOR, Applicant was being garnished \nfor an alimony arrearage of $11,400, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q. The record does not \nindicate how or when he fell behind on his alimony payments. (Item 1; Item 2 at 35; Item \n3 at 4) \nApplicant also attributes his financial issues to additional garnishments that were \nthe result of judgments filed against him for failing to pay other debts. He opened two \nseparate consolidation loans in an attempt to resolve his issues, but they resulted in \nfurther financial hardship. His current wife quit her job to care for her father, which also \ncontributed to their financial problems. The record does not reflect when this occurred. \nAdditionally, Applicant was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017, which resulted in a \ncostly operation and treatment, and his wife was in a serious car accident in 2019, which \nrequired three surgeries. Finally, Applicant blames his financial predicament on a lack of \ncommunication with his current wife; her failure to properly manage their finances after \nshe started a crafting business in 2016; and her excessive use of credit and opening of \naccounts in his name. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3) \nApplicant admitted to the following debts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and \n1.h. They remain unpaid and outstanding. (Items 1 \u2013 6) \nApplicant asserted in his answer to the SOR that he paid and resolved the credit \ncard debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and it no longer appeared on his Transunion CBR. He \nfailed to provide proof of resolution as well as a copy of the Transunion CBR. This debt \nappeared in his November 2018 CBR as a $16,373 account placed for collection in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napproximately June 2016. The debt had increased to $17,931 in his September 2019 CBR. The \ndebt does not appear in his most recent CBR of December 9, 2020. \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he disputed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j. He \ndid not provide proof of his efforts to dispute these debts with the creditors or credit \nreporting agencies. SOR \u00b6 1.i does not appear in his December 9, 2020 CBR; however, \nSOR \u00b6 1.j, a cable provider, continues to appear as a delinquent debt. (Item 6) \nApplicant co-signed two student loans for his son alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o. \nThe accounts were opened in February and September 2011 respectively. Applicant \nclaims he made payments for an unspecified period, but both debts were charged off in \nJuly 2017. \nApplicant provided no proof of payments toward any of the alleged debts in his \nanswer to the SOR, but he provided what appear to be two pages of an undated and \nincomplete credit bureau report. These documents that reflect that SOR \u00b6 1.m was \nresolved in July 2019, after Applicant settled the charged off account for less than the full \nbalance of $4,166. The record does not reflect the amount paid by Applicant. (Item 1; \nItem 3 at 3; Item 6) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had a $13,164 charged-off debt that was satisfied \nthrough a wage garnishment in 2019. Although the language within the allegation \nindicates that the debt was resolved prior to the issuance of the SOR, Applicant provided \nproof that SOR \u00b6 1.r was resolved in January 2019. (Item 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has three delinquent medical debts totaling $197 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, and 1.p). There is no indication in the record that Applicant had additional \nmedical bills that he consolidated or he used his credit cards to pay medical bills. Rather, \nhe attributes his credit card debt to his wife\u2019s excessive spending. (Items 1-6) \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant has received financial counseling \nor follows a written budget. Nor is there evidence of his income and ability to live within \nhis means. His December 9, 2020 CBR indicates he has a new unalleged medical debt \nof $57. According to Appellant, his intent is to resolve his delinquent debts through \ngarnishments. He also indicted in his answer to the SOR that he intended to pay several \nof the allegations within a month or in the near future; however, he did not submit a \nresponse to the FORM with proof of any payments or resolution. (Item 1; Item 6) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \n3 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201cSecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n4 \n\n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that are disqualifying. The following are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThere is evidence in the record that Applicant\u2019s financial issues were, in part, the \nresult of his 2011 divorce, his 2017 cancer diagnosis, his wife\u2019s 2019 car accident, and \nher decision to care for her father, all of which were beyond his control. However, \nApplicant admitted that his wife\u2019s excessive spending and their lack of communication \nregarding their finances significantly contributed to his financial situation, which was \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontrollable. Additionally, the record lacks evidence that Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances to resolve his delinquencies. \nApplicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.r in 2019. He \nsettled SOR \u00b6 1.m for an unknown amount of money, and he resolved SOR \u00b6 1.r \nthrough a garnishment of his wages. He claims he resolved SOR \u00b6 1.b, but failed to \nprovide proof of payments. This debt does not appear on his most recent CBR, but \nthe Appeal Board has held that a debt falling off a credit report is not proof of \nresolution or payment. \nSince 2019, there is no evidence in the record that Applicant has paid or \nresolved any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He indicated in his Answer to the \nSOR that he intended to resolve several of the smaller SOR allegations in the near \nfuture. However, he failed to respond to the FORM and provide proof of any \nresolutions or payments. \nApplicant failed to demonstrate that he initiated or made consistent good-\nfaith efforts to repay his creditors or resolve his alleged debts. The vast majority of \nthe alleged debts are still outstanding, large and small, and Applicant did not \nprovide a plan of how he intends to resolve any the debts. Nor did he provide \nevidence that he is currently living within his means; therefore, these debts reflect an \nongoing concern as to Applicant\u2019s reliability, judgement, and trustworthiness. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) was not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the \ncontext of the whole person. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the \n \nlikelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. The record lacks sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he is reliable, \ntrustworthy, and exercises good judgment. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 \n \n1.l: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n \u2013 \n \n1.q: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity of the United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. National security eligibility is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(AE A, D) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant has family members, friends, and associates who are citizens of Iran. A \nfew of them are Iranian residents, but most of them have acquired citizenship in the \nUnited States or other countries, and Iran continues to recognize them as Iranian \ncitizens. This is true even when the new citizens took no affirmative steps to maintain \ntheir Iranian citizenship, and in the case of the United States, swore to renounce \nallegiance to Iran.1 Nonetheless, they remain Iranian citizens, and if they choose to \n1 See Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America at Section 337 of the Immigration \nand Naturalization Act (INA): \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance \nand fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I \nhave heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreturn to Iran for any reason, they will be treated as Iranian citizens. Iran is hostile to the \nUnited States. It is a state sponsor of terrorism; it conducts cyber espionage and \nattacks, and more traditional espionage against U.S. interests and allies; and it has a \ndismal human rights record. Applicant\u2019s contacts with Iranian citizens create a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been raised by \nthe evidence. \nRussia is a country that can raise significant security concerns. However, \nApplicant has not been in contact with the Russian tour guides in about four years. \nThose limited contacts do not subject her to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are not applicable to the \nRussian tour guides. SOR \u00b6 1.n is concluded for Applicant. \nThe SOR alleges both that Applicant has family friends who are citizens and \nresidents of Iran (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.s), and that she sponsored those family friends into \nthe United States (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.u). I do not find that sponsoring someone to \nimmigrate to the United States raises any security concerns independent of the \ncitizenship and residence status of the individuals, which are already contained in other \nallegations. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.u are concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth, because she was born in the United States \nwhile her father was here on assignment. The process was more difficult for the rest of \nand laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I \nwill bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the \nUnited States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the \nArmed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of \nnational importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this \nobligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher family. Almost all of her family fled Iran and arrived in the United States or other \nallied countries like the United Kingdom and Australia. She and her husband are both \nextremely successful with substantial U.S. assets and no Iranian assets. She credibly \nprofessed her allegiance to the United States and that she would report any attempt to \nuse her family in Iran against her. \nI find that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and the interests of the Iranian government, \na terrorist organization, or her Iranian family members. I further find there is no conflict \nof interest, because Applicant has such deep and long-standing relationships and \nloyalties in America, that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. I also considered the \ntotality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly hostile to the United \nStates, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she has family members \nin a hostile country. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the \nforeign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Iran is a leading state sponsor of \nterrorism, conducts espionage against the United States, and has a dismal human \nrights record. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nAlmost all of Applicant\u2019s family members are in the United States or other allied \ncountries like the United Kingdom and Australia. Applicant is not close to the few family \nmembers remaining in Iran. Applicant was sincere, open, and candid at the hearing. In \nthe unlikely event that her family members were subjected to coercion or duress from \nthe Iranian government or terrorist groups, I find that because of her deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that Applicant would resolve \nany attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the United \nStates.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On October 28, 2020, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), which included nine documents (Items 1-9) proffered as \nevidence in support of its position that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information.

Pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, but they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) (holding \nthat it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection had been \nwaived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to object). \nApplicant was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \n\u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. Applicant did not object \nto the FORM or indicate that the PSI summary contained inaccurate information. \nFurthermore, Government officials are entitled to a presumption of regularity in the \ndischarge of their official responsibilities. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2018), and there is nothing in the record to indicate the PSI contains information \nthat was inaccurate or contrary to what Applicant reported. \nApplicant served in the United States Navy from December 2001 to December 2005 \nand was eligible for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) for most of that \ntime. He then worked outside of the defense industry for a succession of employers before \nacquiring his job with a defense contractor in April 2018. He can reasonably be held to \nhave read the PSI summary, and there is no evidence that he failed to understand his \nobligation to file any objections to the summary if he did not want the administrative judge \nto consider it. Accordingly, I find that Applicant waived any objections to the PSI summary. \nThe SOR and Answer (Item 1) are incorporated in the record as the pleadings. Items 2 \nthrough 9 are accepted into the record as Government\u2019s exhibits, subject to issues of \nrelevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \nFindings of Fact \n3 \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of September 1, 2020, Applicant owed \neight collection debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a - $9,089; SOR \u00b6 1.d - $1,812; SOR \u00b6 1.e - $980; SOR \u00b6 \n1.f - $567; SOR \u00b6 1.g - $1,758; SOR \u00b6 1.h - $1,504: SOR \u00b6 1.i - $993; and SOR \u00b6 1.j - \n$567); two charged-off debts (SOR \u00b6 1.b - $5,172 and SOR \u00b6 1.c - $4,830); and four \nmedical debts (SOR \u00b6 1.k - $2,104; SOR \u00b6 1.l - $1,036; SOR \u00b6 1.m - $1,100; and SOR \u00b6 \n1.n - $156). Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in July 2000 for \n\n \n \n \n \nWhen he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts without any \nexplanation other than that he was making scheduled payments on his student loan debts. \nHe denied SOR allegations \u00b6 2.a, stating he had no recollection of the event, and \u00b6 2.b, \nstating that he was not arrested but instead was fined. He admitted the incidents in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.c-2.j, but explained that the drug use that led to his administrative separation from the \nNavy was \u201ca Japanese cold medicine, while stationed in Japan.\u201d He denied any knowledge \nthat codeine was an ingredient in the medicine and denied abusing it. While he responded \n\u201cI admit\u201d to the alleged falsifications of his SCA, he denied any intent to falsify and \nreiterated that he took the drug in Japan as prescribed. (Item 1.) \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings and Government exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He has been married since February 2015. (Item 2.) He \nhas a 15-year-old stepson, a 10-year-old daughter, and a 6-year-old son. Applicant has \nworked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since April 2018. (Item 3.) He is a \ntechnical support associate. (Item 2.) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 2000. (Item 3.) He apparently enrolled \nin college in June 2000, as he obtained student loans of $1,872 and $753 at that time. \n(Items 4-6.)  \n \n \nIn approximately October 2000, Applicant was involved in a car accident. \nResponding police found a bottle of vodka in his vehicle. He denies that he consumed any \nalcohol before the incident, and there is no evidence to the contrary. However, he was \nfined $295 in April 2001 for illegal possession of alcohol by a minor (SOR \u00b6 2.b). (Item 3.) \n \n \nOn July 27, 2001, Applicant was charged with the felony offense of receiving stolen \nproperty/theft (SOR \u00b6 2.c). On October 18, 2001, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor \ncharge of conversion and entered a pretrial diversion program. The charge was dismissed \non December 5, 2001, in return for him enlisting in the U.S. Navy. (Items 3, 8.) Applicant \nshoplifting (SOR \u00b6 2.a); in October 2000 for illegal possession of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 2.b); in \nJuly 2001 for felony theft/receipt of stolen property (SOR \u00b6 2.c); in September 2009 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d) and January 2011 for driving under the influence (DUI) (SOR \u00b6 2.g); in November \n2010 (SOR \u00b6 2.e), December 2010 (SOR \u00b6 2.f), and January 2011 (SOR \u00b6 2.g) for driving \nwith a suspended license; and in February 2011 (SOR \u00b6 2.h) and September 2011 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i) for probation violation. Additionally alleged under Guideline E, Applicant was given an \nOther Than Honorable discharge from the Navy in December 2005 after receiving non-\njudicial punishment for failure to obey a lawful order and for wrongful use/possession of \ncodeine (SOR \u00b6 2.j). He is alleged to have falsified a March 6, 2019 Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (security clearance application or SCA) \nby denying that he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs (SOR \n\u00b6 2.k) and by denying that he had ever been illegally involved with a drug or controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.l).

Following a background investigation that was \nclosed in approximately August 2002, he was granted eligibility for access to SCI. (Item 2.) \nIn September 2005, an empty bottle of a Japanese cough suppressant containing a \nSchedule II controlled substance (dihydrocodeine), a sealed box labeled with the drug \nname, and some other items were found in Applicant\u2019s room during a barracks inspection. \nApplicant admitted that he had ingested five tablets of the drug the previous evening. He \nwas brought before a Captain\u2019s Mast for failure to obey an order or regulation, in violation \nof Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and for wrongful use and \npossession of a controlled substance, in violation of Article 112a of the UCMJ (SOR \u00b6 2.j). \n(Item 7.) He was placed on limited duty and his access to SCI was revoked (Items 2-3.) \nDuring his May 2019 PSI, Applicant explained that he became ill while stationed in Japan; \nthat the woman he was dating had purchased the drug for him, and that he had forgotten \nthat he was prohibited from purchasing any drugs from Japanese pharmacies. (Item 3.) In \nDecember 2005, Applicant was given an Other Than Honorable discharge. (Items 2-3.) \nOn September 27, 2009, Applicant was arrested for DUI (SOR \u00b6 2.d). During his \nMarch 2019 PSI, Applicant stated that he had consumed only two drinks on that occasion, \nbut also that on his arrest, his blood alcohol level tested at .18%, which suggests he may \nhave consumed more alcohol than he has stated. On October 26, 2009, he pled guilty and \nwas fined $1,951 and placed on two years of probation. (Items 3, 9.) \nOn November 2, 2010, Applicant was arrested for DUI after drinking \u201ca few drinks\u201d \nat a bar with some friends. He pled guilty and was sentenced to a diversion program. His \nprobation for his previous DUI was extended (SOR \u00b6 2.e). (Items 3, 9.) The offense is \ninexplicably alleged in the SOR as driving on a suspended license, even though the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (Item 9) and Applicant (Item 3) indicate it was a DUI \noffense. \nOn December 23, 2010, Applicant was caught driving while his license was \nsuspended (SOR \u00b6 2.f). He was released at the scene and allowed to return home. (Item \n1.) \nOn January 10, 2011, Applicant was arrested for DUI; criminal driving-driving while \nlicense suspended; and misdemeanor recklessly endangering (SOR \u00b6 2.g). On March 30, \n2011, he was convicted of the DUI and criminal driving-driving on a suspended license. For \nthe DUI, he was sentenced to ten days in jail, a $2,618 fine, and 48 months of probation. \nFor driving while his license was suspended, he was fined $1,286 and placed on 48 \nmonths of probation. The recklessly endangering charge was dismissed. (Items 3, 9.) \nOn February 3, 2011, Applicant was arrested for probation violation and criminal \ndriving-driving on a suspended license (SOR \u00b6 2.h). (Items 1, 9.)

His \nprobation was extended to October 2013 for the probation violation. He was sentenced on \nthe criminal driving charge to 15 days in jail, a $2,409 fine, and 36 months of probation. \n(Item 9.) \nOn March 6, 2019, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA on \nwhich he responded negatively to inquiries concerning whether he had ever been charged \nwith an offense involving alcohol or drugs (SOR \u00b6 2.k) and whether he had been involved \nillegally with a drug or controlled substance while holding a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.l). \n(Item 2.) At the time, Applicant did not recall his underage alcohol possession offense that \noccurred in October 2000. He apparently recalled the September 2009 and January 2011 \nDUI arrests (the November 2010 DUI was not alleged), but he asserts that he had no \nintention to falsify his SCA. Regarding his use of an illegal drug in September 2005, \nApplicant admits that he had taken a Japanese cough medicine, but denies that he took it \nother than as prescribed. (Item 1.) He reported on his March 6, 2019 SCA that his SCI \naccess eligibility was cancelled in September 2005 after he received non-judicial \npunishment. (Item 2.) He did not elaborate on his SCA about the reason for his Captain\u2019s \nMast and Other Than Honorable discharge from the military. \nDuring his May 2, 2019 PSI, Applicant provided details about his use of codeine in \nSeptember 2005, which led to his non-judicial punishment and military discharge. He \nresponded \u201cYes\u201d when asked whether he had ever been arrested for an offense involving \nalcohol or drugs and volunteered that he had been arrested for DUI in October 2009, \nNovember 2010, and January 2011. (Item 3.) There is no indication that he was asked by \nthe OPM investigator to explain his SCA denial of any alcohol-related charges on his \nrecord. \nFinances \nThere is no information in evidence about Applicant\u2019s employments, if any, after his \nmilitary discharge in December 2005 until April 2009, when he began working in customer \nsupport for a cable and Internet services provider. After one year, Applicant then worked as \nan assembler in the semiconductor industry from May 2010 to February 2012. He was \nunemployed from February 2012 until April 2013. He then worked as a technician for about \na year. From April 2014 to April 2017, he was employed as a production assembler. He \nthen worked from May 2017 to April 2018 as a production technician for yet another \nemployer outside the defense industry. (Item 3.) The evidentiary record contains no \ninformation about his income from these employments. \nOn his March 6, 2019 SCA completed for his current employer, Applicant listed a \n$980 cell phone delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.e) that he was disputing; a $9,089 vehicle loan debt \nin collection that he cannot afford to repay (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and past-due medical debts of \n$2,104 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and $1,036 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) that he was disputing. (Item 2.) A check of \nApplicant\u2019s credit on March 19, 2019, revealed additional delinquencies, including student \nloan debts.

(Items 4-6.) Applicant did not report the debt on his March 2019 \nSCA. (Item 2.) He disputed the debt when confronted about it during his May 2019 PSI. \n(Item 3.) The debt was reported by Equifax as unpaid as of September 2020. (Item 6.) \nDuring his May 2, 2019 PSI, Applicant stated that he previously viewed his credit as \n\u201cout of sight, out of mind,\u201d and that he did not realize its importance in his life. He admitted \nthat he had held an immature attitude about his credit. He explained that he was the sole \nincome source for his household as his spouse had to care for their autistic child and two \nother children. He gave priority to necessities such as rent and utilities over other debts. \nApplicant asserted that he was living within his means and paying his debts, and that his \npresent income should allow him to repay his past delinquencies and avoid new financial \nproblems. He described his overall financial situation as stable. The OPM investigator gave \nApplicant the opportunity at and after his PSI to provide additional documentation about his \ndelinquent debts, and he failed to do so. (Item 3.) \nThe DCSA CAF issued an SOR to Applicant on September 1, 2020, partially \nbecause of the aforesaid delinquencies. All but one of them (SOR \u00b6 1.m) were included on \none or more of his credit reports. In response, Applicant admitted each of the debts, but \nindicated that he was \u201cmaking scheduled payments\u201d on the four student loans alleged in \nthe SOR. He provided no documentation of those payments. His October 2020 credit \nreport (Item 6) showed a substantial reduction in the balances owed on the student loans \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i, although it is unclear to what extent the reduction is due to \npayments by Applicant and/or interception and application of his income tax refund in \n2019. \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant filed a response to the FORM. \nApplicant presented no details about his income or expenses. There is no evidence that he \nhas had any financial or budget counseling. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n10 \n\n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n11 \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. The available credit information substantiates that \nApplicant defaulted on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l and 1.n. Applicant\u2019s record of \ndelinquency establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant also admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. However, there is no clear evidence \nthat proves the validity of the debt. It does not appear on any of the credit reports in the \nevidentiary record. Applicant did not list the debt on his SCA, and he was not asked about \nit during his PSI. Applicant exhibited during his PSI a lack of full knowledge about his \ndebts. There is no credible evidence that conclusively establishes the debt as a legitimate \nobligation for Applicant. I find the Government failed to meet its threshold burden to \nestablish the debt as a security concern. \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his proven delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAvailable credit information for Applicant shows that he and a joint borrower \ndefaulted on the automobile loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b in March 2015 and May 2013, \nrespectively. The installment sales contract (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was charged off in October 2012. \nThe cell phone (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and cable services (SOR \u00b6 1.f) debts were placed for collection \nin 2014. While these debts were incurred some time ago, AG \u00b6 20(a), which provides for \nmitigation of debts that happened \u201cso long ago,\u201d cannot reasonably apply. None of these \ndebts have been resolved. These debts are considered recent because an applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 \nat 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2018) (citing e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, \n2017)). His four student loans were in collection status at the time he completed his SCA in \nMarch 2019, even though progress was subsequently made on two of them. The medical \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n) were incurred in 2018, and they remain unpaid. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant explained during his PSI that his financial issues \nwere incurred because he is the sole source of income for his household. His spouse has \nto care for their three children, including their autistic child. However, he did not provide any \ndetails about his income or expenses so it is difficult to determine whether he managed his \nincome responsibly. Additionally, Applicant did not provide any information showing that \nthe debts were incurred due to circumstances beyond his control. To the contrary, he \nacknowledged during his PSI that he had held an \u201cimmature\u201d attitude about his credit and \nlargely ignored his old debts (\u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d). \n \n \nFurthermore, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply in mitigation, Applicant has to demonstrate tha\nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances to address his debts. He failed to do so\nDuring his May 2019 PSI, Applicant expressed an intention to establish payment plans fo\nseveral of his past-due debts. There is no evidence that he acted on his stated intention t\naddress the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.k, and 1.l. The Appeal Board has held that a\napplicant must demonstrate \u201ca plan for debt payment, accompanied by concomitan\nconduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d See AD\nCase No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 a\n5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018). There is no evidence that Applicant made any attempt t\ncontact his creditors or otherwise take action toward resolving or settling his delinquen\ndebts with the exceptions of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d and the student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.\nand 1.i. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhether in large part due to payments by Applicant or with respect to the student \nloans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i also the application of his income tax refund, the debts in SOR \nt \n. \nr \no \nn \nt \nP \nt \no \nt \ng \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g., and 1.i have been sufficiently resolved to apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) to those \ndebts and find for Applicant on those debts. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been \nsatisfied with regard to those delinquencies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.f, 1.h, 1.k-1.l, and 1.n) \nfor which no debt reduction has been shown. Two of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c) have been \ncharged off and do not appear on his latest credit report. So too, some of the collection \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f and 1.k-1.l) have been dropped from his credit report. While some of \nthe debts may no longer be a source of financial pressure for Applicant, the Federal \ngovernment is still entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding his conduct \nin incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, 2015). The Appeal Board has held that the administrative \njudge is not precluded from considering whether the circumstances underlying a debt \nimpugn an applicant\u2019s judgment or reliability. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-02206 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 15, 2015). Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) is established by waiting until past-\ndue balances are written off by creditors who may decide not to pursue a debt any longer, \nor until debts drop from one\u2019s credit record because of the passage of time without activity \nor other reason unrelated to payment or having a reasonable dispute of the debt. There is \nno evidence that Applicant attempted to make any payments on the delinquencies that \nhave been removed from his credit report or on the debts that are still adversely affecting \nhis credit. Furthermore, Applicant has not presented evidence that he has had financial \ncounseling, which is required for full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). AG \u00b6 20(e) is established \nonly with respect to the alleged debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, which was not proven to be a legitimate \nobligation for Applicant. \nApplicant is credited with not incurring credit-card debt that could further strain his \nfinances, but not enough is known about Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, including \nhis income and expenses, to overcome the financial judgment concerns in this case. A \nreasonable assessment of his financial situation is not possible based on the limited \ninformation available. The financial considerations security concerns have not been \nadequately mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \nThe Government alleges security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct \nbecause of his arrest record; his non-judicial punishment and military discharge for using \nan illegal controlled drug (codeine); and falsification of his March 2019 SCA for failing to \nreport any offenses involving alcohol and his use of non-prescribed codeine in 2005 while \nhe had a clearance.

He violated his \nprobation for a January 2011 DUI by driving on a suspended license in February 2011 and \nSeptember 2011. Applicant denies an alleged arrest for shoplifting in July 2000 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a), and that allegation was not proven to have occurred. While Applicant denies he was \narrested for underage possession of alcohol in October 2000 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), he admitted to \nan OPM investigator on May 15, 2019, that he had been fined for the offense. Applicant \ndoes not dispute that he received non-judicial punishment and was discharged from the \nNavy for use of a prohibited controlled substance (codeine) in September 2005 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.j). However, he asserts that he had no knowledge that codeine was an ingredient in the \ncold medicine that he took in Japan, and denies abusing the substance. His denial of any \nknowing misuse of a controlled substance was found not credible by the military, however. \nApplicant\u2019s record of offenses, and his misuse of codeine while he held SCI access \neligibility, occurred between 10 and 20 years ago. Nonetheless, when his dated offenses \nare considered with his more recent SCA falsification, they demonstrate a serious pattern \nof disregard for law, rules, and regulations. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. It \nprovides: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \nRegarding his negative responses on his SCA to inquiries concerning whether he \nhad ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs (SOR \u00b6 2.k) and whether \nhe had ever been illegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a \nsecurity clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.l), the objective evidence shows that Applicant should have \nlisted his DUI offenses and his misuse of codeine on his SCA. Applicant admits the \nnegative responses to the inquiries but denies any intentional falsification. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence to explain the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \nApplicant did not provide an explanation for his failure to list his DUI offenses on his \nSCA. He clearly knew about the offenses, for he volunteered them when asked about any \nalcohol or drug charges during his May 2, 2019 PSI. I find that he deliberately omitted them \nfrom his SCA. In addition to raising security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(c), the deliberate \nomission of information that is relevant and material to the investigation and adjudication of \nhis security clearance eligibility raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a). That \ndisqualifying condition provides: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nI am not persuaded that Applicant deliberately omitted his abuse of codeine from his \nSCA, however. Although Applicant responded, \u201cI admit,\u201d to whether he had deliberately \nfailed to disclose his codeine use on his SCA, he also stated, \u201cAt no time was I abusing this \ndrug or taking it other than prescribed.\u201d He did not regard his use of codeine as illegal, but \nrather as it turned out, a failure to comply with a signed agreement not to purchase a drug \nfrom a Japanese pharmacy. Applicant indicated on his SCA that he had received non-\njudicial punishment and been discharged from the Navy, which militates against a finding of \nintentional concealment on that issue. Accordingly, I find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 2.l. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides for mitigation of the personal conduct security concerns under one \nor more of the following conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(a) has some applicability in that Applicant made a \ntimely effort to rectify his deliberate omission of his DUI offenses from his SCA. The \nevidence shows that, at his first opportunity, Applicant volunteered to the OPM investigator \non May 2, 2019, that he had been arrested for and convicted of three DUI offenses. \nHowever, his falsification of his SCA and his extensive, albeit now old, criminal record \ncannot be viewed in isolation from each other. I cannot reasonably apply AG \u00b6 17(c) \nbecause of the recency of his SCA falsification and the recidivist nature of his DUIs and \ncriminal driving on a suspended license, including in violation of his probation for drunk \ndriving. Applicant has shown some reform under AG \u00b6 17(d) by volunteering information \nabout his DUIs and other offenses during his May 2, 2019 PSI. However, he has yet to \nprovide a credible explanation for his failure to list any of his DUIs on his SCA. While he \nadmits \u201cEvents 2d and 2g,\u201d he also stated it was not his intention to falsify facts. When \nconsidered as a whole, Applicant has demonstrated questionable judgment that continues \nto cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security clearance eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines \nF and E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \n17 \n\n \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). It was \nincumbent on Applicant to show that his financial situation is sufficiently stable and not \nlikely to present an ongoing security concern. As discussed above, too many unanswered \nquestions exist about his financial situation. He presented no character reference \ninformation that could possibly overcome the doubts about his personal conduct. By not \nreporting any of his alcohol offenses on his SCA, he exhibited an unacceptable tendency to \nact in self-interest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009), \n(citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.l: \nFor Applicant \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history, which includes multiple delinquent debts, is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant \nattributed \nhis \nfinancial \nproblems \nto \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment after his discharge from the military. However, several debts became \ndelinquent before his discharge from the military and others became delinquent after he \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstarted his current job, including unpaid federal and state taxes. The only debt that is \nbeing paid is through involuntary garnishment of his pay, which earns him less credit in \nmitigation. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",
