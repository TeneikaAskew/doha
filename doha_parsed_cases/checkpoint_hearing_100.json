Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Heather C. Tenney, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 23, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 15, 2017, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 13, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) \non May 11, 2018, scheduling the hearing for June 12, 2018. Applicant retained an \nattorney on May 24, 2018, and requested a continuance for additional time to prepare. \n02/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nWith no objection, I granted Applicant\u2019s request and DOHA issued an amended NOH on \nMay 29, 2018, rescheduling the hearing for July 9, 2018. I convened the hearing as \nrescheduled. \n \nI appended to the record, as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, the Government\u2019s discovery \nletter and exhibit list. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, \nwhich I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record \nopen until July 23, 2018, for additional evidence. By that date, Applicant submitted \nadditional documentation, which I marked as AE E and admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 13, 2018.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. He is 49 years old. He married in \n1991, divorced in 1995, remarried in 1996, divorced in 2011, and remarried in 2011. He \nhas three children: one is an adult from his second marriage, and the other two are \nminors from his current marriage.1 \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1987, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1992, and earned a juris doctorate degree in 1995. He worked in state law enforcement \nfrom around 2001 to 2007, and he has since served as a reserve officer. He has worked \nfor various DOD contractors since 2008. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as a \ndivision vice president for a DOD contractor since January 2018. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance.2  \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges a delinquent consumer account for $5,709 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and a \nstate tax lien from December 2006 for $31,253 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). SOR \u00b6 1.a is established \nby a 2017 credit bureau report. Applicant disclosed and discussed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nin his 2015 security clearance application (SCA), 2016 background interview, and 2017 \nresponse to interrogatories.3  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for the outstanding balance on an apartment lease placed in \ncollection for $5,709. Applicant and his wife broke their lease seven months early. She \nunexpectedly became pregnant with their second child in 2013 and they decided they \nneeded to rent a bigger place. Prior to breaking the lease, he unsuccessfully attempted \nto work with the apartment company to resolve the outstanding balance, but was told \nthere was nothing that could be done and his balance would be placed in collection.4  \n \n                                                     \n1 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 18-77; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 5-6, 18-77; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n3 GE 1-4; AE A, E. \n \n4 Tr. at 22-27, 40-43, 61-66; GE 1, 2, 4; AE A, D. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn 2014, Applicant unsuccessfully attempted to work with the collection agency \nwhen he received a demand letter for payment. The collection agency only wanted a full \nor a half payment, which he could not then afford. He paid a security deposit and the \nfirst and last month\u2019s rent on his new rental; he was paying child support for his eldest \nchild; and he was ensuring that his mortgage on his home, as further discussed below, \nremained current. He stopped trying to work with the collection agency in 2014, when it \nthreatened to sue him. Between 2014 and 2017, he received telephone calls from the \ncollection agency demanding payment in full, which he still could not then afford.5  \n \n \nIn December 2017, Applicant contacted the collection agency to try to resolve the \ndebt. He was motivated, in part, from having received the August 2017 SOR. He \nmanaged to rebuild his credit, and he had a credit card that he could use to resolve the \ndebt. He also had enough money in his 401k retirement account that he could use, if \nnecessary. He sought to pay in full with his credit card, only to learn that the collection \nagency stopped accepting any payments from his credit-card company. In May 2018, \nhe resolved the account in full with a loan from his 401k retirement account.6 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $31,253 state tax lien entered against Applicant in 2006. \nApplicant attributed the lien to incorrect advice that he and his parents received from a \ncertified public accountant (CPA) in 2003. In around 2000, his parents put his name on \ntheir home; the home was fully paid, he was living in it, and they retired and wanted to \nmove elsewhere. When he sold the home in 2003 and gave the money to his parents, \nthe CPA advised him that he would not have to pay taxes on the proceeds from the sale \nof the home.7 \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant received a letter from the IRS and the state Department of \nRevenue (DOR), informing him that he owed back taxes on the sale of the home in the \namounts of approximately $60,000 to the IRS and $30,000 to the state DOR, for a total \nof $90,000. He could not then afford to pay the back taxes, as he earned $30,000 \nannually working as a state police officer and his then-wife was a bank teller. The IRS \nand the state consequently placed tax liens on his home, which he and his first wife \npurchased in 2004, effectively preventing him from selling it. His ability to sell the home \nwas further hampered when the economic downturn affected its value from 2006 \nthrough 2010.8  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his and his then-wife\u2019s yearly federal income tax refunds \nfrom 2006 to 2017, totaling approximately $5,000 to $10,000, were applied to the \n$60,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS, and the IRS released its lien in 2016. He \ntestified that his yearly state income tax refunds from 2006 to 2009,9 and his then-wife\u2019s \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 22-27, 40-43, 61-66; GE 1, 2, 4; AE A, D. \n \n6 Tr. at 22-27, 40-43, 61-66; GE 1, 2, 4; AE A, D. \n \n7 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E. \n \n8 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E. \n \n9 Applicant moved out of that state in 2008. Tr. at 48, 55-56. \n\n \n4 \n \nyearly state tax refunds from 2006 to 2014, totaling approximately $3,000 to $5,000, \nwere applied to the $30,000 in back taxes owed to the state DOR. He testified that the \nstate has not made any efforts to collect on its lien since 2014. He hired an attorney in \n2017 to assist him with resolving the outstanding state tax lien, though she had been \nadvising him since the lien was placed against his home in 2006 because he has known \nher for a long time both professionally and personally. He testified that his attorney \nadvised him against setting up a payment plan for the back taxes when his and his \nthen-wife\u2019s federal and state income tax refunds were being intercepted, since the IRS \nand the state DOR already placed a lien against his property and he could not then \nafford a payment plan; he testified that he also did not attempt an offer-in-compromise \n(OIC) because he could not then afford a sufficient offer amount to do so.10 \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant started to see value return to his home, and he had $50,000 in \nequity in it as of the date of the hearing. However, he testified that he had not listed the \nhome for sale because the existing lien would prevent him from securing a buyer. His \nattorney advised him that his best course of action is to find a qualified buyer who is \naware of the lien on the home; notify the state DOR that they have a qualified buyer; \nnegotiate with the state DOR on an OIC for the outstanding state tax lien; and use the \nproceeds from the sale of the home to resolve the negotiated OIC for the lien. He \nintends to follow his attorney\u2019s advice. His attorney is assisting him with finding a \nqualified buyer for the home. His prior renter from 2015 to 2018 desired to purchase the \nhome, but she ultimately did not qualify for financing. His current renter desires to get \nprequalified to purchase the home, but her efforts are at a standstill until her pending \ndivorce is final. He believed the balance on the state tax lien as of the date of the \nhearing was approximately $50,000 to $60,000, with penalties and interest.11 \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s household annual income was $254,000 as of the date of the \nhearing. His wife started working as a teacher in 2018. In 2008, his annual income was \napproximately $78,000; in 2009, it was $90,000; in 2012 it was $150,000; in 2015 it was \n$170,000; and in 2016 it was $185,000. He has approximately $8,000 in savings and \n$30,000 in his 401k retirement account. After his income and expenses, his monthly net \nremainder is approximately $1,000. He testified that he has timely filed his federal and \nstate income tax returns. He does not have any other delinquent debts. He is current on \nhis expenses, to include his mortgage of $1,000 monthly and repayment of his 401(k) \nloan. Other than the financial advice given to him by his attorney, he has not received \nfinancial counseling.12 \n \n \n \nTwo former supervisors described Applicant as an exemplary worker and a man \nof professional integrity. Applicant\u2019s landlord from 2016 to at least 2018, who also \nconsidered Applicant a friend, attested to Applicant\u2019s timely rental payments as well as \n                                                     \n10 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E. \n \n11 Tr. at 27-35, 43-56, 66-77; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, E. \n \n12 Tr. at 35-40, 50-51, 56-61, 74-75; GE 4; AE B, D. \n\n \n5 \n \nhis trustworthiness and unquestionable ethics. Other character references also \ndescribed Applicant as a responsible and diligent individual.13 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n                                                     \n13 AE C. \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts, to include a state tax lien from 2006. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(f) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n7 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nFor the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under his circumstances. He credibly testified that he unsuccessfully tried to \nwork with the apartment company and the collection agency for SOR \u00b6 1.a prior to the \nSOR. He then continued his efforts upon receipt of the SOR and when he had the \nfinancial capability to resolve this debt, which he did in May 2018. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nand 20(d) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nApplicant\u2019s ability to sell his home to satisfy the state tax lien in SOR \u00b6 1.b was \nhampered when the economic downturn affected the home\u2019s value from 2006 through \n2010. He credibly testified that though he did not hire an attorney to assist him with \nresolving the lien until 2017, the attorney has given him advice, which he has been \nfollowing, since the lien was entered against him 2006. On the attorney\u2019s advice, he \nrelied upon the state DOR\u2019s interception of his and his then-wife\u2019s yearly state income \ntax refunds from 2006 to 2014, collectively, to resolve the lien during this period. He did \nnot attempt to set up a payment plan or present an OIC to the state DOR. He indicated \nthat he also lacked the income during this period, however he has earned upwards of \n$150,000 annually since at least 2012. He did not list the home for sale because he \ntestified that the existing lien would prevent him from securing a buyer. \n \nApplicant believed the balance on the lien as of the date of the hearing was \napproximately $50,000 to $60,000. On his attorney\u2019s advice, he planned to find a \nqualified buyer who is aware of the lien on the home; notify the state DOR that they \nhave a qualified buyer; negotiate with the state DOR on an OIC for the outstanding state \ntax lien; and use the proceeds from the sale of the home to resolve the negotiated OIC \nfor the lien. He intends to follow his attorney\u2019s advice. As of the date of the hearing, he \nhad not secured a qualifier buyer, as his prior renter from 2015 to 2018 did not qualify \nfor financing, and his current renter\u2019s efforts to secure financing are at a standstill until \nshe finalizes her divorce. As such, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) \ndo not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor seeking to maintain a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since August 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1994 to December 2003. He separated as an E-5 with an honorable discharge. Between December 2010 and December 2011, Applicant was unemployed. In 2010, he lost his job as a result of a reckless driving offense, which resulted in him serving 15 days in jail. During this period of unemployment, he lived off savings and took college courses. Between 2011 and 2018, he served in the Air National Guard. He has worked for various DoD contractors as well as other jobs. He is a high school graduate, has attended college courses, but does not have a degree. He is single and has no children. (Tr. 32- 38; Gov 1; Gov 2; Gov 9) Applicant has held security clearances in the past. On February 4, 2000, the Army issued an SOR and notified Applicant of their intent to deny his access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) and classified information for financial reasons.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n    \n \nOn July 18, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on December 13, \n2017. The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2018. The hearing was initially \nscheduled for February 27, 2019.  Applicant\u2019s request for a delay was granted. On \nFebruary 26, 2019, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 3, \n2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing, the Government offered \nten exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 10. A File of \nRelevant Material, dated August 23, 2017, was not admitted as evidence, but was \nmarked as HE II. Applicant testified and offered 16 exhibits which were admitted as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A - P. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 15, 2019. Based \n\n \n2 \n \n \nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to maintain a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since \nAugust 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1994 to \nDecember 2003. He separated as an E-5 with an honorable discharge. Between \nDecember 2010 and December 2011, Applicant was unemployed. In 2010, he lost his \njob as a result of a reckless driving offense, which resulted in him serving 15 days in jail. \nDuring this period of unemployment, he lived off savings and took college courses. \nBetween 2011 and 2018, he served in the Air National Guard. He has worked for \nvarious DoD contractors as well as other jobs. He is a high school graduate, has \nattended college courses, but does not have a degree. He is single and has no children. \n(Tr. 32- 38; Gov 1; Gov 2; Gov 9)   \n \nApplicant has held security clearances in the past. On February 4, 2000, the \nArmy issued an SOR and notified Applicant of their intent to deny his access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) and classified information for financial \nreasons.  Applicant submitted a response to the SOR. Based on his answer, the Army \nCentral Clearance Facility (CCF) reinstated his security clearance and access to SCI on \nJune 7, 2000. The Army CCF warned Applicant that retention of his SCI access \neligibility and security clearance was contingent upon Applicant not incurring any further \nfinancial mismanagement or other personal behavior that would render him ineligible. \n(Gov 8)   \n \nOn February 14, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application as \npart of a periodic reinvestigation. In \u201cSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record\u201d of the application, \nhe disclosed a delinquent debt owed to a homeowner\u2019s association; delinquent student \nloans; a delinquent car loan; and a delinquent military exchange account. (Gov 1, \nsection 26) \n \nA subsequent security clearance background investigation resulted in the  \nfollowing SOR allegations: failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 10, 15);  a delinquent federal \ntax debt in the amount of $7,561 for tax year 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 10, 15, 19); a \n$995 delinquent state income tax debt for tax year 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: AE A at 6, 13, 14, \n36); a mortgage account that was delinquent in the amount of $3,596, with an \napproximate total balance of $287,763 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 1 at 11; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 7); \na $5,065 judgment from a home owner\u2019s association filed in October 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: \nGov 1 at 12; Gov 4 at 4); a $2,830 judgment filed in May 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 1 at 10; \nGov 4 at 4); a $6,917 charged-off car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 1 at 2; Gov 3 at 2); and a \n$2,948 charged-off account motorcycle loan. (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 3 at 2). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant admits that he did not file his federal and state income tax returns for  \ntax years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Applicant states that he got into tax problems \nbecause of financial problems from being unemployed, trying to maintain his mortgage \npayments, and the stress from his mother and his guardian both suffering from terminal \nillnesses at the same time. Applicant testified he was stressed out about his mother\u2019s \nillness. He focused on his mother, forgot about paying bills, and did not pay attention to \nthe mail.  His mother passed away in 2016. (Tr. 39-40; Gov 2) \n \n Applicant\u2019s federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 were \nfiled on March 11, 2017, a few days before submitting his answer to DOHA \ninterrogatories on March 13, 2017.  In his answer to interrogatories, Applicant stated: \u201cI \ndo intend to pay all the monies owed to the IRS with the payment plan, as discussed \nwith the IRS. I plan on filing on time this year for my 2016 taxes. Please allow me to \nremedy these issues; I will be able to do so. I can provide the payment agreement once \nI receive it.\u201d (Gov 2 at 15)  \n \nApplicant is still attempting to file his 2012 federal tax return. He obtained his W-2 \nforms for tax years 2013-2015 online. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not post \nthe 2012 W-2 online. Applicant has to contact the IRS directly in order to get his W-2 for \n2012. Applicant received refunds for tax years 2013 and 2014. He owes federal income \ntaxes for tax year 2015. He originally owed around $7,561. The balance is now $3,324. \nHe was on a payment agreement for a period of time. The IRS did not allow him to \ncontinue with the payment agreement because he did not timely file his 2016 and 2017 \nincome tax returns. (Tr. 41-44; AE A; AE B)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 were filed \napproximately one week before the hearing. He owes about $4,651 for tax year 2016 \nand is expecting a refund for tax year 2017 of $2,723. He also expects a refund for tax \nyear 2018 of 5,252. The IRS will apply the refunds towards the taxes he owes for 2015 \nand 2016. Applicant did not timely file his federal tax returns for 2016 and 2017 because \nhe was dealing with issues with his mortgage and was attending school. His house \npayment increased from $1,600 to $2,200 and he was trying to keep his house. (Tr. 45-\n47; AE L; AE M; AE N)   \n  \nApplicant\u2019s 2010 reckless driving offense, his previous financial issues that raised \na security concern in 2000, his failure to timely file his 2016 and 2017 federal income \ntax returns, and his $4,651 federal tax debt for tax year 2016 were not alleged in the \nSOR as disqualifying conduct. I considered these facts when evaluating evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation, or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2016)  \n  \nRegarding the state income tax returns, Applicant filed his state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 in March 2017. He has not filed his 2012 \nstate income tax return. His 2016, 2017 and 2018 state tax returns were filed with his \nfederal tax returns in early April 2019. Applicant owes $955 in state income taxes for tax \n\n \n4 \n \n \nyear 2015. He owes $453 in state income taxes for tax year 2016. He anticipates \nreceiving a refund of $862 for tax year 2017 and a refund of $1,285 for tax year 2018.  \nHe anticipates the refunds will be applied towards his state tax debt. He anticipates that  \nall state and federal taxes owed will be paid by the end of 2019. (Tr. 48-51; AE A; AE C; \nAEL; AE M; AE N)  \n \nThe status of the SOR debts other than the tax debts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: $3,596 delinquent home mortgage account:  Applicant purchased the \nhouse in January 2010. He tried to keep up with is mortgage payments, but the \nmortgage went to foreclosure in August 2018.  Applicant claims he owes nothing \nbecause the house sold for more than the mortgage balance. (Tr. 51-52, 77; AE A at \n16-17; AE C)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $5,065 judgment owed to a homeowner\u2019s association (HOA):  \nApplicant failed to pay the monthly HOA fees of $95. The HOA would add a $25 late fee \neach month that he was late. The balance of the judgment includes attorney\u2019s fees. \nApplicant\u2019s paycheck was garnished $194.37.  In total, approximately $2,493 was \ngarnished. The remaining balance is around $3,400. In March 2019, Applicant agreed to \npay $500 monthly towards the debt. He did not provide proof of payments made in April \n2019 in accordance with the payment plan. (Tr. 54-58; AE A at 19-23; AE F) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: $2,830 judgment entered in 2012: Applicant testified that this was for \na watch that he bought on credit for $3,000 in 2010.  Applicant satisfied this judgment. \n(Tr. 59-61; AE A at 25-26; AE H at 22-23) \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g:  $6,917 car loan that was charged off:  Applicant purchased this car \nin late 2009. Applicant reduced the balance to $3,416. He is still attempting to settle this \naccount. He last contacted the debtor in 2017 in an attempt to settle the account. Status \nremains unpaid. (Tr. 63-65; AE A at 28-29)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h: $2,948 motorcycle loan that was charged off: Applicant purchased \nthis motorcycle in February 2010. He paid this account in April 2017. (Tr. 63-64; AE A at \n30-31; AE G; AE H at 20)    \n \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also has a delinquent military \nexchange debt. He currently is making payments towards this debt. (Tr. 66; AE 10)  \n \nApplicant is currently staying with a friend. He has been paying his debts for \nabout a year. He does not owe any other debts. He has not made any major purchases. \nHis net monthly income is $3,500. Applicant applies most of his income to his debts. He \ntimely pays $349 towards his student loan debt. He has not attended recent financial \ncounseling. When he encountered finance-related security clearance issues in early \n2000, his command sent him to financial counseling. The financial counseling helped \nhim organize his bills. Applicant has not vacationed in years. He intends to make \n\n \n5 \n \n \npayments towards all of his remaining debts monthly until they are paid in full. (Tr. 68-\n76)    \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n6 \n \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems since around 2011. He failed to \ntimely file his state and federal income tax returns from 2012 to 2015. He owes state \nand federal taxes from tax year 2015. He was unable to pay his mortgage resulting in \nforeclosure in August 2018. He incurred a significant debt to his HOA resulting in a \n$5,065 judgment entered against him in 2012. Another $2,830 judgment was entered \nagainst him for failure to make payments towards a loan to purchase an expensive \nwatch. Finally, two loans he took out to purchase an automobile in late 2009 and a \nmotorcycle in February 2010, resulted in charged-off accounts, in the amounts of \n$6,917 and $2,948. The total approximate amount of the debts alleged in the SOR \nincluding the 2015 state and federal tax debts, but not including the mortgage, is \n$26,316. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \n  \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \n\n \n7 \n \n \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5) \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control:  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. \nWhile Applicant has filed his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014 and \n2015, he still owes taxes for 2015. He has not filed his tax returns for 2012. Applicant \nstill owes a significant debt to his HOA, and to a bank for an automobile loan. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems, it is too soon to conclude that his \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. His conduct towards resolving his tax debts was \nnot proactive. As a contract employee entrusted with a security clearance, Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nshould have been aware of his duty to file and pay his federal and state income taxes in \na timely manner. He almost lost his security clearance in 2000 because of financial \nissues. He was given another chance, but continued to have financial issues. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility and his failure to file state and federal tax \nreturns in a timely manner over a six-year period raises questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was adversely \naffected by his under-employment while a full-time student and his one year period or \nunemployment between late 2010 to 2011. However, Applicant\u2019s job loss was the result \nof his reckless driving offense in May 2010. This mitigating condition is given less \nweight. I considered that Applicant dealt with the added stress of his mother\u2019s terminal \nillness and the death of his guardian. Despite these challenges, one must still follow \nthrough with one\u2019s financial obligations. This mitigating condition is given less weight \nbecause I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has been continuously employed since 2012, yet he did not timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns from 2012 to 2017.  (The 2016 and 2017 federal \nand state income tax returns can be considered under matters of mitigation, even \nthough they were not alleged in the SOR.) I cannot conclude Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances with regard to his delinquent debts and his tax \nissues. \n    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant attended financial counseling around 2000, \nwhen he encountered financial issues when he served in the Air National Guard. He \nwas notified that he was about to lose his security clearance and access to SCI. His \ncommand gave him a chance and sent him to financial counseling. His security \nclearance and SCI access were reinstated on the condition that he keep his financial \nissues under control. Applicant did not take this warning to heart and has continued to \nencounter financial problems.   \n \n \nAG & 20(d) partially applies towards the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.f and \n1.h. Applicant filed his late federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013, \n2014, and 2015. Credit is also given to Applicant regarding his mortgage and the \naccounts that he has paid and settled. However, he has not filed his federal and state \ntax returns for 2012, still owes a balance on his state and federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016, and continued to be late filing his federal and state income tax \nreturns for 2016 and 2017, filing them one week before the hearing with no reasonable  \nexplanation for the delay. I cannot conclude that Applicant has made a good-faith effort \nregarding his tax debts.  His state and federal tax debts remain unresolved.  \n \nAG & 20(g) does not apply. With regard to Applicant\u2019s federal tax debts, the \nrecent emphasis of the DOHA Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. ISCR Case No. 17-01807 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018) states: \n \nThe mere filing of delinquent tax returns . . . does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide \nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or \nvice versa. The timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the \nJudge to consider in the application of mitigating condition 20(g) as well as \nin considering aspects of other overlapping mitigating condition[s].  \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of \nsecurity clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency \nfor years and then taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy \nundercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect \nthe voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with \nthe nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed). See also ISCR Case No. \n14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, and \nstating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nAt the close of the record, Applicant had not filed his state and federal tax returns \nfor 2012, even though he had sufficient time to do so. He did not consistently make \npayments towards his 2015 federal and state tax debts. He failed to timely file his \nfederal and state tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. Applicant claims that his state \nand federal tax debts will be resolved by applying refunds and possible payments if \nneeded by the end of 2019.  A promise to pay or resolve an issue in the future does not \nmitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s tax situation. Applicant\u2019s history of \nconsistently failing to timely file his federal and state tax returns over a six-year period is \ngiven more weight than his last minute attempts to resolve his tax issues and other \ndebts.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n       I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s career with \nfederal contractors. I considered his honorable service in the United States Army from \n1994 to 2003, and his service in the Air National Guard from 2011 to 2018. \n \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s one year period of unemployment from 2010 to 2011 \nand several years of under-employment adversely affected his household finances. I \nalso considered Applicant was laid off because of his own misconduct. He continued to \nignore his financial obligations by failing to timely file his state and federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 \u2013 2015. Despite Applicant\u2019s expressed intentions to timely file \nhis income tax returns for tax year 2016, he did not do so. He also failed to timely file his \n2017 income tax returns. While Applicant filed all of his federal and state tax returns \n(with the exception of tax year 2012) a few weeks before the hearing, significant tax \ndebt remained at the close of the record. Applicant was not proactive in bringing his \nstate and federal tax situation under control. He has resolved several of his debts, but \nseveral of the debts remain unresolved at the close of the record. While not alleged in \nthe SOR, during the hearing, it was discovered that Applicant encountered financial \nissues in the past which adversely affected his security clearance. He was given \nanother chance with the warning that he should keep his financial situation under \ncontrol. Despite this warning, Applicant continued to demonstrate a pattern of financial \nirresponsibility. Security concerns under financial considerations are not mitigated.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c, 1.e, and 1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 23, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 16, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines \nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on June 8, 2017.   \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). \n02/05/2019\n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nOn July 18, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision on \nthe written record. When he obtained counsel, Applicant elected to have a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (HE I) On August 9, 2018, the case was assigned to me. \nOn September 24, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing, setting the hearing for November 15, 2018. Applicant\u2019s hearing was \nheld as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; there were no \nobjections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 13; \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-3. At the hearing, Applicant provided eleven exhibits, (AE) \nA-K, which were admitted without objection. On November 26, 2018, DOHA received a \ntranscript of the hearing.   \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, established in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. I have \nevaluated Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered a summary for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Saudi Arabia.  \n(Tr. 8) Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of facts concerning \nSaudi Arabia, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. Administrative or official \nnotice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR \nCase No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice \nat ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing \nfifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Portions of the Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequests are quoted without quotation marks and footnotes. \n \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted five allegations and denied two of the SOR allegations. He \nalso provided mitigating information. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old, and was born in Egypt to Jordanian parents. He \nrenounced his Jordanian citizenship a few years ago, and he was never an Egyptian \ncitizen. (GE 2)  Applicant lived in Egypt with his family where he attended an English \n                                            \n1 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n\n \n3                                                                                                                                             \nschool.  In 1984, he obtained his undergraduate degree in business management. (AE \nA, B)  After college, he worked in Saudi Arabia for an international company. He was \npromoted and moved to Egypt. He left Egypt in 2000 to come to the United States. (GE \n2). Applicant wanted to be in the United States due to the many opportunities for himself \nand his children. \n \nIn 1982, Applicant married, and in 2016, he divorced. (AE K) He has three \nchildren from his marriage. In 2000, he immigrated to the United States with his then- \nwife and children. In 2007, Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen. (AE C)  \nIn  2009, he obtained a security clearance. \n \nApplicant has worked as a linguist for the U.S. Army since June 2006. (AE B) He \nserved as a linguist on a military installation from 2006 to 2007 in Iraq. After that, in \n2008, he returned to Iraq to again work for the U.S. Army and lived on an installation. \nApplicant was then assigned to three different locations in combat zones. Applicant has \nreceived many letters of commendation from officers with whom he worked. Each attests \nto his exceptional ability to aid as a cultural advisor and translator. Applicant is intelligent \nand hard working. He was instrumental for a successful mission in Iraq. (AE F) The U.S. \nofficer stated that Applicant is \u201crecognized as one of the top linguists in the area\u201d. He \nparticipated in dangerous missions. Applicant received awards and certificates for his \nservice in Iraq and Kuwait. (AE H)  \n \n Applicant has a retirement account and savings in the United States.(AE I) He \ndoes not have any property or bank accounts in foreign countries. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife \nlives in the United States and has no foreign property. Applicant has siblings and cousins \nin the United States. \n \nThe SOR raises the following foreign influence security concerns:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant\u2019s father, brother and sister are citizens of Jordan \nand reside in Saudi Arabia. Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Jordan. (GE 1) His mother \nis deceased. Applicant admits this allegation. He had not seen his family members when \nhe was in Kuwait, but now that he is in Saudi Arabia he visited his father once. The \nfamily members are not allowed on base without an invitation. The family members have \nnot been to the base. (Tr. 22) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant\u2019s brother claims citizenship with the United States \nand Canada. He resides in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 22) He is not connected to the government \nof Saudi Arabia. (Tr.) Applicant communicates with him once every few years.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant\u2019s sister is a U.S. citizen living in Saudi Arabia.   \nApplicant said his sister is married and she and her children live in Saudi Arabia. She is \na U.S. citizen. Now that Applicant is in Saudi Arabia, he sees his sister for lunch on \noccasion.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant\u2019s child is a dual citizen of Jordan and the United \nStates residing in Egypt. She has moved to the United States and holds a U.S. passport. \n(Tr. 23) She is a university professor. (Tr. 24)  \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a Jordanian citizen residing in \nSaudi Arabia. Applicant denied this allegation as his brother-in-law is a United States \ncitizen, and holds no other citizenship. He has no contact with him since his divorce. (Tr. \n10)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is an Egyptian citizen living in Egypt. \nApplicant has no contact with her.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant\u2019s father is a retired member of the Saudi Arabia \nMinistry of Information. This is not accurate. Applicant\u2019s father worked for the ministry for \none year a long time ago, and disputes that he retired from the ministry. His father is ill \nand elderly (80). Applicant calls his father once every ten days.  \n \n Saudi Arabia \n \nThe United States and Saudi Arabia generally have good relations and share a \ncommon concern about regional security in the Middle East. Relations between the \nUnited States and Saudi Arabia were strained after the September 2001 terrorist attacks. \nDuring 2003 and 2004, terrorists and suicide bombers kidnapped or killed Americans \nand attacked the U.S. consulate. Terrorist attacks have been attempted or have occurred \nin the last several years. The State Department warns U.S. citizens to carefully consider \nthe risks of travel to Saudi Arabia due to concerns about potential terrorist activity \ndirected against U.S. citizens and interests.  \n \nIndividuals and organizations based in Saudi Arabia have been designated by \nthe U.S. government as providing financial and material support to al-Qa\u2019eda and more \nrecently to ISIL and other terrorist groups. Violence from the conflict in Yemen has \noccasionally \u201cspilled over\u201d into Saudi Arabia with numerous projectiles being launched  \nfrom Yemen into Saudi Arabia. Human rights problems have occurred throughout Saudi \nArabia. \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant admitted: (1) his father and sister are residents of Saudi Arabia, and he \nhas some contact with them; (2) his child is a U.S citizen and lives in the United States; \n(3) his sister is a U.S. citizen residing in Saudi Arabia; (4) he does not have contact with \nhis sister-in-law or brother-in-law living in Egypt.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \n Applicant has voluntarily shared in dangers from terrorists on behalf of the DOD \nwhen he was deployed to Iraq as a U.S. Army translator, and he is willing to do so in the \nfuture. Numerous linguists, supporting U.S. forces, have family living in countries that \nhave problems with terrorists and criminals. Thousands of United States and coalition \narmed forces and civilian contractors serving in the Middle East and Afghanistan are \ntargets of terrorists, along with their families.   \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Saudi Arabia is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his \nor her spouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-\n02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s \nfather to Iran).2  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Saudi Arabia with the United States, and the situation in that country \nplaces a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with any family member living in or visiting those countries does not pose a \ntrustworthiness or security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he \nmight be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a \nrelative living in or visiting Saudi Arabia.3  \n \n                                            \n2 In accordance with \u201cwell established DoD policy [Applicant and his family\u2019s] religious affiliation \nplay[ed] no part\u201d in this decision. ISCR Case No. 08-06795 at 6 n. 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2012). \n3 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Saudi Arabia, seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a \npossibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Saudi Arabia has a \nsignificant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in Saudi Arabia \u201ccould \nbe a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. \ninformation or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Saudi Arabia, or visiting \nthose countries create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place \npressure on his family in Saudi Arabia, in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise \nclassified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel \nproduced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Saudi Arabia,  \nand has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of \nany mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nApplicant does not have frequent contacts with his sister and brother-in-law in \nSaudi Arabia. His father is ill and elderly. His child is a U.S. citizen living in the United \nStates. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f are mitigated because of Applicant\u2019s lack of \ncontacts and connections with these relatives living in Saudi Arabia or Egypt. He does \nnot send any money to any relatives.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies. Applicant has frequent contact with or a close \nrelationship with his father, who is a resident of Saudi Arabia. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 \n8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S.\u201d Applicant resided in the United States from 2000 to present, except for the years \nfrom 2006 to the present when he served as a linguist in combat zones.4 In 2007, \n                                            \n4 ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board discussed a translator\u2019s \nmultiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time as a resident in the United States, and \nconnections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal Board stated: \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen. His daughter is in the United States and has a U.S. \npassport. Applicant has served the U.S. Army and has received numerous \ncommendations from the military officers in the U.S. Army. His retirement account and \nsavings are in the United States. He has no foreign connections or property. He \nhonorably served as a linguist in war zones for the U.S. Army, which included a tour in \nIraq. \n      \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Iraq, including the dangers that service entailed, \nweighs heavily towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant seeks to renew a security \nclearance to enable him to continue serving the Middle East providing assistance to \nDOD. He has shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his \nsupport to DOD while serving in Iraq and other dangerous locations.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are residents \nof Saudi Arabia. Applicant has close relationships with family in Saudi Arabia when he \nworks on a military installation in Saudi Arabia. He did not have contact when he was in \nIraq and other places.  \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in the Middle East, and Applicant has supported U.S. goals and \nobjectives in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s relatives living in Saudi Arabia are potential targets of \n                                                                                                                                            \n     \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. forces is not a \nfactor that weighs against his or her national security eligibility. On the contrary, such \ndeployments tend to establish various mitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe foreign . . . \nactivities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it is] unlikely to result in a conflict of \ninterest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d) \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of security clearance). \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nterrorists, and Applicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically \nadd risk to his relatives living in those countries from lawless elements in Saudi Arabia. \n   \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Saudi Arabia, are \noutweighed by his service to the United States.  He has mitigated the circumstances in \nthis case. His connections to the United States taken together are sufficient to \novercome the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old, and he came to the United States in 2000. He is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen who has, since 2006, served as a linguist for the United States \nArmy in war zones. He has held a security clearance since 2009. He renounced his \nJordanian citizenship and is only committed to the United States. His daughter has \nmoved to the United States and has a U.S passport.   \n \n \n     Applicant resided in the United States from 2000 until he began his work as a \nlinguist in 2006.  He has bank accounts in the United States. He has received \ncommendations from the U.S. military. He took the oath of allegiance to the United \nStates when he became a U.S. citizen.  \n \nApplicant served in Iraq and several other war zones. He made contributions at \npersonal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. All these circumstances increase \nthe probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign \npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him. See ISCR Case No. \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \n07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past honorable service in Iraq weighs \nheavily towards mitigating  foreign influence security concerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming grant of security clearance and \ncommenting \u201cApplicant has served as a translator and as a cultural liaison between \nAmericans and Iraqi citizens, diffusing tensions and facilitating transactions between the \ntwo groups. . . . . Applicant put his life in danger on at least one occasion to protect \nAmerican lives and interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Saudi Arabia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there.5  Terrorists continue to threaten Saudi Arabia, \nand the interests of the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate \nand assist the United States. The United States and Saudi Arabia are allies in the war \non terrorism.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence security \nconcerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a- 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 16, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the Government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 13, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2018.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 6, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were \nadmitted. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthough E. The record was left open until December 20, 2018, and Applicant timely \n02/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nsubmitted a packet of documents, which was marked as AE F, and was accepted into the \nrecord without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December \n14, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 58, is married and has one adult child. She obtained her  \nundergraduate degree in 2007. She also has a master\u2019s in theology and other \ncertifications. Applicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) on \nSeptember 29, 2015. She has held a security clearance since 2004. (GE 1) She worked \nfor her current employer since 2015. She previously worked as a contractor since 1998. \n(Tr. 18) \n \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2005 that was dismissed in \n2005 when Applicant failed to complete required filings; a 2016 state tax lien in the amount \nof $7,308; a 2011 state tax lien in the amount of $13,132.00; a 2012 Federal tax lien in \nthe amount of $41,313.00; a medical account in the amount of $560; and a 2014 eviction \nlaw suit. Applicant admitted the allegations relating to the financial allegations. The SOR \nalleged under personal conduct concerns three instances of falsification on her 2015 \nsecurity clearance application. Applicant denied the falsifications on the security \nclearance application and she provided explanations for her financial situation. \n \nFINANCIAL \n \nApplicant acknowledged her financial hardship, but reported unemployment from \nDecember 2014 to February 2015 and from July 2015 to September 2015. Applicant was \nself-employed from May 2007 to May 2009 and from October 2009 to December 2010. \n(GE 2) Applicant also referred to bad advice from an accountant regarding the filing of  \nher self-employment tax return. A final unemployment occurred when a contract ended in \nOctober 2017 until April 2018. (Tr. 47) \n \nApplicant suffered a stroke in the workplace, but did not have health insurance as \nshe was working as a 1099 employee and responsible for health insurance. She suffered \nsome short term memory loss as a result, and noted this to the OPM investigator when \nshe had neglected to provide certain dates. (GE 2) \n \nAs to SOR 1.a, Applicant admitted the bankruptcy filing (GE 9) and explained that \nher attorney advised her to file as there was a home contractor who was attempting to \ngarnish her wages and extract $68,000 from her for work that had not been done and for \nwhich she had no account. (Tr. 51) She was not aware of this until she was purchasing a \nhome and it appeared on her credit report. Her attorney asked for proof from the company \nthat Applicant owed $68,000 and nothing was forthcoming. The bankruptcy was \ndismissed. It has not appeared on her credit bureau report for some time and she has \ndiscussed this issue in previous investigations. The action is 12 years old. \n \nApplicant admitted that she was indebted for the state tax lien (SOR 1.b) in an \noriginal amount of $7,308. However, Applicant stated that there is only one account or \n\n \n3 \n \nlien for the state and the total is $13,132, which is the other state tax lien alleged in SOR \n1.c. She submitted a document from the state comptroller, dated March 2018 showing a \nbalance of $4,786.08 for tax year 2007 and a balance of $9,072.72 for tax year 2009. (AE \nA) Applicant explained that the tax was due to the inaccurate tax filing by her accountant.  \nApplicant was to file as an S corporation but the filing was for a C corporation. (Tr. 22) \nShe explained that in 2011, she began paying $400 a month, but it was not clear from the \nrecord that the payment was going to the IRS. At one point, she received the checks back. \nThey had been torn in half. In 2018, Applicant contacted the state comptroller\u2019s office and \nexplained her \u201csituation.\u201d Applicant reached an agreement for a payment plan for a term \nof 60 months with a down payment of $1,374 and monthly payments of $235. She stated \nthat the tax year 2008 had been paid in full. Applicant has not started making any \npayments and stated that her husband had a massive heart attack and she is the only \none employed. (Tr. 25) \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, a 2012 Federal tax lien in the amount of $41,313, Applicant made \nan offer in compromise for $2,400, which was accepted. She made monthly payments of \n$100. Applicant presented a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien (AE B) and a letter \nfrom the IRS, dated 2013 that the final payment was made by credit card and that all \npayments had been made. (AE B) \n \nAs to SOR 1.e, a medical account in the amount of $560, Applicant stated that she \nhas been making payments to a creditor monthly in the amount of $87. However, there is \nno record of any payments made to the account. As a post-hearing submission, Applicant \nprovided a receipt for $480, but it was not clear to whom it was paid. (AE F) \n \nApplicant explained that the law suit situation which resulted in allegation SOR 1.f, \nis due to a flood that occurred above her apartment in May 2014, when her dining room  \nfilled with scalding water from the roof. She called maintenance and after about 20 \nminutes a technician. The technician was unsuccessful in stopping the water and he \ncalled the supervisor. It took another 20 minutes to turn the water off in the above \napartment. This left her apartment uninhabitable and she checked into a hotel. (AE C) \nManagement asked Applicant to move all her belongings out so that the apartment could \nbe renovated. When Applicant asked to be reimbursed for her May rent and expenses \npaid for the hotel night, she was told no. Applicant moved things as fast as she could. \nBefore she was finished a notice of eviction was placed on her door. She was charged \nfor various repairs for which she paid. \n \n Applicant volunteered that she filed for an extension for her 2017 Federal tax \nreturn. (Tr. 59) It has been filed and she owes about $8,000. She stated that she believes \nshe also owes states tax for 2017. (Tr. 60) She testified that this was due to the old \naccountant that she had a problem with concerning the S versus C corporation,  i.e,  filing \nthe wrong tax returns during her self-employment in 2008.  She has a new accountant.  \n \nPERSONAL CONDUCT \n \nWhen Applicant completed her 2015 SCA, she answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 26 \nconcerning liens against your property or failure to pay taxes in the past seven years. She \n\n \n4 \n \nalso answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 26 concerning bills or debts turned over to collection \naccounts. Also, Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to Section 28 regarding non-criminal court \nactions in the last ten years. \n \nApplicant denied that she intentionally falsified her 2015 SCA. In her answer, she \nstated that she did not have a lien placed against her property for failure to pay taxes.  \nShe stated that she did not become a home owner until 2015 and the taxes owed were \npaid in 2013.  She testified that she answered all questions to the best of her ability and \nas for being a party to a law suit regarding the apartment, the amount of money was paid \nand she did not regard this as being a party to a law suit. She realized at the hearing that \nshe answered incorrectly. (Tr. 35)  She was adamant that she did not believe the medical \naccount was in collection because it was due and owing to a hospital. (Tr. 36)  She \ntestified at the hearing that she had liens (both state and federal) but they had been \nresolved in years prior.  Applicant stated that she kept no information from the investigator \nduring her interview. (Tr.45) She reiterated that she was completely open and honest with \nthe Government when she answered the questions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u2026.failure to \npay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \n\n \n6 \n \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy occurred in 2005, and is an isolated event. She \nexperienced unemployment on various occasions and suffered a stroke. Her husband \nsuffered a heart attack. She also received some bad advice from an accountant. These \nevents were beyond her control. She also had flooding in her apartment as a result of a \nflood from an apartment above. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has significant \ntax issues, an unpaid medical debt, and 2017 Federal tax due in the amount of about \n$8,000.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s unemployment, stroke and other \nhealth issues were beyond her control, she has not acted responsibly to address the \nresulting debts. She has not produced sufficient information to show that she has been \nproactive in her actions. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is under control. She \nhas settled a Federal tax lien but has not started payments on other liens. She did not \nsubmit proof or documentation about her medical account. Her current ability to pay her \ndelinquent debts and taxes is in doubt. Her financial problems are not under control.  \n \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n\n \n7 \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of her SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that she falsified her 2015 SCA, in her answer, and in her remarks \nat the hearing, she was adamant that she was not trying to defraud the Government.  She \npaid a Federal tax lien and did not understand the question about a lien on property. She \nanswered to the best of her ability. In fact, she had denied those allegations on the SOR. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission.1 An applicant\u2019s level of education and business experience are \nrelevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on an SCA was \ndeliberate.2  \n \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments that she was not aware of \nthe intent of the questions. At the hearing, she agreed that she answered inaccurately \nwhen the questions were explained. She should have disclosed the delinquent debts she \nhad knowledge of on her SCA. However, I find insubstantial evidence of an intent by \nApplicant to intentionally omit, conceal, or falsify facts from and on her SCA. Therefore, \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant made prompt or good-faith efforts to correct any misleading or false \ninformation when she spoke openly to the investigator during her interview. Applicant was \ncredible and has shown that similar lapses in judgment are unlikely to recur. She provided \nsufficient information in this record to demonstrate that she has met her burden of proof \nfor her personal conduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, including her credibility and openness at the hearing, I \nconclude that Applicant did not deliberately falsify her SCA, but she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not \ncarried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nher eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

The credit bureau reports indicate that by September 2015, \nhe accumulated $15,673 in child support arrears for one of his daughters. In early 2018, \nhe demonstrated good judgment by hiring an attorney to address the support arrears \nissues. However, instead of applying more of his earnings to resolve the arrears issue, \nhe exercised poor judgment by purchasing a vehicle in December 2017 and a \nmotorcycle in May 2018. Eligibility for security clearance access is denied.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 2, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to continue a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 5, 2017, detailing security concerns raised by \n\n \n  2 \n \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on September 1, 2006. \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence \nissued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs). The guidelines are applicable to all individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to \nhold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the September 1, 2006 AGs and are \neffective on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on May 26, 2017. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 23, 2018, for a \nhearing on November 15, 2018. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s \nthree exhibits (GE) 1-3 and Applicant\u2019s nine exhibits (AE) A-I were entered into \nevidence without objection. The record remained open until November 30, 2018, to \nallow Applicant to submit additional documentation regarding his budget. No \nsupplemental documentation was received. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non November 26, 2018. The record closed on November 30, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes delinquent child support of $15,673 (SOR \n1.a). The account was placed in collection in In September 2015. Applicant admitted the \nallegation. (GE 2 at 1; Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He married in 2004 and divorced in 2012. He has five \nchildren, two 17-year-old daughters, and three sons, ages 17, 4, and 1 year. Applicant \nserved on active duty in the United States (U.S.) Army from July 1999 until his \nhonorable discharge in March 2008. He attended vocational school from March 2008 for \nsix years. In 2014, Applicant began taking course material for a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ncybersecurity, but withdrew to begin course work to earn information technology (IT) \ncertifications. In March 2018, he began online course work towards a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin science, with an ultimate goal of obtaining a master\u2019s degree in IT. (GE 1 at 13, 27, \n30; Tr. 7-15) \n \nAfter his discharge from the U.S. Army in March 2008, Applicant worked in \ndefense contractor positions and in federal employment positions. He worked as a \n                                            \n1 My decision in this case would be the same under the 2006 or 2017 guidelines. \n  \n\n \n  3 \n \nmaterial coordinator, a supply technician, an account manager, a quality safety \nmanager, and a management and program analyst. In 2015, Applicant worked in his \nfirst cyber security position. He was employed at a help desk from 2016 until June 2018, \nwhen the contract ended resulting in his unemployment. He is still unemployed. He \ncurrently has a sponsor. His previous periods of unemployment were March to June \n2008, March to May 2012. September to November 2012, and July to September 2013. \nHe has held a security clearance since 1999. (GE 1 at 13-33; Tr. 10-15, 33-34)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s first daughter was born in 2002 and she is 17 years old. In January \n2003, a child support court order for this daughter began in state X. The child support \npayments were $289 a month; the support order increased to $350 a month in October \n2008. Applicant claims that he began having difficulty paying the support after he was \ndischarged from the Army in 2008. Because of joint marital accounts related to the \nmarriage (2004 to 2012) and lawyer fees related to the divorce, he could only pay some \nbut not all the monthly child support. He initially filed for separation from his former wife \nin state X, but after he moved to state Y, he had to refile for separation. (Tr. 37-39) \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s first daughter came to live with him in June 2016, his child \nsupport should have been modified downward but it was not. In October 2016, the first \ndaughter was removed from Applicant\u2019s home because of allegations of sexual abuse \nagainst Applicant that were found to be totally groundless. The first daughter was \nrelocated to her grandmother\u2019s residence, but after residing there for three to four \nmonths, she ran away. The daughter was placed in an outplacement program at a \nboarding school in July 2018 and was to move back with Applicant in December 2018, \nwhen she was discharged from the program. (Tr. 44-45, 53-55) \n \nApplicant\u2019s child support payment ledger for January 2003 through May 11, 2017 \n(child support for first daughter) indicates that his payment record to the county child \nsupport office of state X was neither regular in amount nor frequency. That is probably \nwhy his child support arrears ($35) started accruing immediately when his support \npayments increased from $289 to $350 a month in October 2008. On March 30, 2017, \nthe state Y division of child support enforcement (DCSE), the state where he currently \nresides, informed him by letter that he owed $15,673 in past-due child support and \nthreatened to suspend his driver\u2019s license because his past-due child support was over \n$5,000 or was past due by 90 days or more. (AE A; AE F) \n \nWhen Applicant received the letter In March 2017 from state Y claiming he owed \nchild support arrears of $15,673 to state X (division of child support), he began to \ninvestigate why the arrearage was so high. In June 2017, he was informed by letter \nfrom the state Y division of child support enforcement (DCSE) that because of the \nexistence of an out-of-state support order for the first daughter living with him in state Y \nduring the period, and an in-state child support order for the second daughter residing in \nstate X, the wage garnishment payments were \u201csplitting\u201d and neither mother was \nreceiving the correct support due. Instead, they were receiving partial instead of full \nsupport payments from state X child support office, which increased Applicant\u2019s arrears. \n\n \n  4 \n \nNo additional information was provided. Applicant hired an attorney in May 2018 and an \naudit was conducted of his entire child support payment history for the first daughter. On \nNovember 8, 2018, his attorney notified him that his child support hearing had just been \nheld that day. The court found that his child support obligation (SOR 1.a) was \nsuspended retroactive to March 2018. Applicant still owed arrears of $6,794 to the \nmother of the SOR 1.a child support recipient, to be repaid at $30 a month. Applicant\u2019s \narrears owed to the child support recipient\u2019s grandmother was $4,114, to be repaid at \n$200 a month. Though Applicant had not received a court order that memorialized the \nfindings, he informed the judge that he would start making payments on December 1, \n2018, to the mother and grandmother. (AE A; AE B; AE D; AD E; Tr. 43-46) \n \n \nApplicant has a second 17-year-old daughter whose child support order \n(unalleged) was also implemented in January 2003. The terms of the support order are \nthe same as for the daughter in the preceding paragraph. Applicant claimed that he is \nregularly paying child support of $350 and $35 toward the arrearage on a monthly basis. \nThe arrearage amount, about $10,000, is not alleged in the SOR. Also unalleged in the \nSOR are Applicant\u2019s unofficial child support payments for his three sons: about $350 a \nmonth for his 17-year-old son; about $350 a month for his 4-year-old son; and about \n$200 a month for his one-year-old son. (Tr. 40-42, 52, 57) I will consider this unalleged \nevidence in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation or changed circumstances, and in \napplying the factors of the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant receives a partial disability pay from the U.S. Army and is financing his \neducation from his military benefits. He lives by himself in an apartment that that he \nrents for $1,100 a month. He has two cars; one is for commuting; the other is used for \ntransporting his children in the local area and when he travels to state X to visit his \nchildren. He purchased one car in September 2016 and one car in December 2017. He \npays a total of $973 a month for both cars. He pays a total of $100 a month for two \nmotorcycles. He does not remember when he purchased one of the motorcycles, but he \nremembered it cost between $3,000 and $4,000. He purchased the other motorcycle in \nMay 2018 for $5,000. He uses one of the motorcycles for the track and the other is for \nleisure riding. Applicant has a total of $3,000 in his checking and saving accounts. He \nhas about $500 in stock. He participated in financial counseling in September 2018 to \nremove the collection items that were negatively affecting his credit score. (Tr. 46-61) \n \nIn March 2018, Applicant opened a limited liability cybersecurity company and \nseeks to qualify for a facility security clearance so he can start bidding on contracts. He \nis trying to obtain his small business certification, minority-owned certification, and a \nservice veteran certification. (Tr. 71-73) \n \nTo manage his earnings and expenditures, Applicant utilizes a budget with the \nhelp of a computer software program. He testified that he wanted an opportunity to \nsubmit evidence of a budget. The record remained open until November 30, 2018, but \nno post-hearing evidence was received. (Tr. 49, 62-63) \n \n\n \n  5 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nA person with access to classified information occupies a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated on good judgment, trust and confidence. A person who \ndisplays financial irresponsibility may also be irresponsible or negligent in safeguarding \nclassified information at all times and in all places.  \n \n\n \n  6 \n \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise a security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of not paying his child support for his first daughter. \nHis child support records from the state X division of child support show that his child \nsupport payments were irregular. At the time his child support payments increased to \n$350 monthly by court order in October 2008, he was immediately assessed arrears. By \nSeptember 2015, his child support arrears for the SOR 1.a daughter was $15,673. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b620 include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts \n \nAfter receiving a letter from DCSE of state Y in March 2017 advising him that he \nowed past due child support totaling $15,673, and indicating that his driver\u2019s license \ncould be suspended unless he took action on the child support issue, in May 2018, \nApplicant retained an attorney to file a motion to redirect support payments and \ndetermine child support arrears. In November 2018, his attorney advised him that after \nthe hearing, the court determined that he no longer owed child support and his arrears \nwere reduced to $6,795. The mitigation Applicant receives under AG \u00b6 20(a) is reduced \nby his failure to act much sooner to rectify the arrears problem. Mitigation under the \ncondition is reduced even more because of the absence of documented evidence to \n\n \n  7 \n \nsupport Applicant\u2019s testimonial claim of owing only child support arrears for his second \ndaughter.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) recognizes events that result in financial problems beyond the \nperson\u2019s control. Applicant\u2019s brief periods of unemployment were events beyond his \ncontrol. The improper calculations by the state X division of child support concerning his \nfirst daughter was an additional event beyond his control. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) has \nlimited application because Applicant has not demonstrated he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Instead of being more proactive in directing a larger part of his \nearnings to his child support and support arrears of his two oldest daughters, he \npurchased two cars in September 2016 and December 2017. He purchased his second \nmotorcycle in May 2018. On balance, AG \u00b6 20(b) has only limited application to the \ncircumstances of this case.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) address steps an applicant has taken to bring his debts \nunder control. Though Applicant contended that he received financial counseling in \nSeptember 2018, the service was directed more toward eliminating collection items from \nhis credit report. He claimed he had a budget to track his finances, yet, he declined to \npresent evidence of a budget. While he appears to be gaining control over the arrears \nfor his first daughter, there is no documented evidence to indicate that his second \ndaughter\u2019s arrears issues are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable \nin part. The limited application of AG \u00b6 20(d) is dramatically diminished by Applicant\u2019s \nsporadic child support payment record since 2003.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old mature adult, who is divorced with five children. He \nwas honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in March 2008. He is taking courses to \n\n \n  8 \n \ncomplete a bachelor\u2019s in science degree and hopes to obtain a master\u2019s degree in IT. I \nconsidered that Applicant\u2019s child support arrears for his first daughter were much less in \nNovember 2018 than originally posted in the March 2017 letter from DCSE of state Y \nand the SOR. However, Applicant provided no documentation concerning the status of \nthe child support issues for his second daughter. Even though he has known for a long \ntime that he owed child support arrears for both daughters, he used extremely poor \njudgment and irresponsibility in purchasing a vehicle in December 2017 and a \nmotorcycle in May 2018. Considering the evidence as a whole, Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n07/23/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems, which is ongoing. He has not taken any substantial affirmative action \nto resolve more than $50,000 in delinquent debt. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non March 31, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on June 26, 2017, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2017. He provided handwritten \nresponses on the SOR. His answers to the SOR allegations were mixed, with \nadmissions and denials. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on September 19, 2017. The hearing \nscheduled for September 28, 2017, was cancelled. The case was reassigned to me on \nMay 22, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on September 19, 2018. Applicant \nappeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which \nwere admitted as Exhibits 1-8. Applicant did not offer any documentary exhibits, he \ncalled no witnesses, and he relied on his own testimony. The hearing transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on September 27, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. He is employed as a custodian for a company in the defense industry. He \nhas been so employed since 2016. He was initially hired at an hourly rate of $11.00, \nand he now earns $13.67 per hour. His formal education consists of a high school \ndiploma and a certificate in automotive repair or maintenance from a technical institute \nawarded in 1984. He married in 2013, and he has no children. His spouse works as an \nadministrative assistant for a community college. Applicant is unaware of her income; \nthey handle their money separately; and they share living expenses.  \n \nBefore his current employment, Applicant worked full-time as a carpet technician \nfor a casino during 2014-2016. Before that, he worked full-time as a security guard for \ntwo different companies during 2008-2014. Before that, he worked full-time as a \ncustodian for a federal contractor during 1999-2008. His employment history does not \ninclude service in the U.S. armed forces.   \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of about $5,000 in \nback taxes owed to the IRS for multiple tax years and 22 delinquent accounts totaling \nmore than $50,000. Concerning the delinquent accounts, they include 13 collection \naccounts, 7 charged-off accounts, and 2 unpaid judgments for a total of about $56,152. \nTwo of the 13 collection accounts are medical collection accounts for about $1,687 in \ntotal. In addition to his admissions in his answers to the SOR and during the hearing, \nthe delinquent accounts are established by credit reports from 2016, 2017, and 2018. \n(Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7). He explained that he incurred the large amount of \nindebtedness because he had too many credit cards. (Tr. 37) At the hearing, it was \nestablished that the $453 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.t was paid. (Tr. 45-46) \nLikewise, it was established that the $154 medical collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.x was \nnot supported by the documentary evidence. (Tr. 48) Otherwise, Applicant did not \npresent any reliable documentation to establish that any of other 20 delinquent debts \nwere paid, settled, in a repayment arrangement, in dispute, forgiven, cancelled, or \notherwise resolved. I find that those 20 delinquent accounts in the SOR are unresolved. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nConcerning the tax matters, Applicant admitted owing back taxes to the IRS for \ntax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 in amounts of $2,708, $1,932, and $306, respectively. \nHe explained that he incurred the tax debt because he did not have enough tax withheld \nfrom his paycheck. (Tr. 31) He has been repaying the IRS in an installment agreement \nsince at least 2016. (Exhibit 3) A November 2016 monthly notice from the IRS showed \nthat he was required to make a $150 monthly payment and that he owed $132 for tax \nyear 2011, $2,708 for 2013, $1,932 for 2014, and $360 for 2015. (Exhibit 3) A May 2017 \nmonthly notice from the IRS showed that he was required to make a $150 monthly \npayment and that he owed $2,890 for tax year 2013, $1,462 for 2014, and $381 for \n2015. (Exhibit 2) He did not present more up-to-date documentation from the IRS at the \nhearing. He stated he is paying $180 monthly on the installment agreement, and he \nestimated owing a total of about $1,899. (Tr. 31-34) He stated that refunds for tax years \n2016 and 2017 were withheld by the IRS for payment of the back taxes. (Tr. 35) He \nthinks he owes back taxes to the state tax authority, but he did not have much detail on \nthe subject. (Tr. 34)  \n \nApplicant has a checking account with a balance of about $899, but does not \nhave a savings account. (Tr. 50) He had no financial assets other than a 401(k) account \nwith his current employer with a balance of about $7,000. (Tr. 50-51) He estimated his \nannual gross income at about $32,000. (Tr. 37)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n                                                          \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. His problematic \nfinancial history is likely traceable to financial irresponsibility and neglect. He used credit \ncards to spend more than he could repay, and he did not stay current with his federal \ntax obligations. The disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nConcerning the remaining delinquent accounts for more than $50,000, what is \nmissing here is obvious; namely, Applicant failed to take any substantial affirmative \naction (\u201ca good-faith effort\u201d) to resolve the indebtedness. He owes more in delinquent \ndebt than he earns on an annual basis, and he has little in the way of financial assets. \nHe does not have a realistic plan in place to resolve the indebtedness. It is unlikely that \nhe will repay those debts in the foreseeable future, if ever. Given the level of his assets \nand liabilities, his best course of action may be to seek relief in bankruptcy court.  \n \n \nIt does appear that Applicant has made some progress on the federal income tax \nmatters. There is some documentation from 2016 and 2017 to establish that he has \nmade payments under an installment agreement with the IRS. But again, what is \nmissing here is obvious; namely, current documentation showing his adherence to the \nagreement. Given the lack of current documentation, I cannot conclude that he is in \ncompliance with the IRS installment agreement.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 29, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on November \n15, 2017. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on January 9, 2018, scheduling the hearing for January 23, 2018. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record \nwas left open for two months until March 23, 2018, for receipt of additional \ndocumentation.  Applicant presented one set of documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \nExhibits (AppX) A, and admitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (TR) on January 31, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the two allegations in SOR: \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 14.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since July of 2016. (GX 1 \nat pages 14~15.) He is unmarried, and has no children. (GX 1 at pages 24~25.) \nApplicant attributes his admitted financial difficulties to periods of unemployment. (TR at \npage 12 line 24 to page 17 line 6.) \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. Applicant has failed to file, as required, Federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2011~2013 and for 2016. (TR at page 20 line 10 to page 28 line 13.) He attributes \nhis failure to file due to periods of overseas deployment while in the Air Force, and to \nsimple procrastination. (Id, and GX 1 at pages 18~19.) Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation showing his filing for tax year 2014 (AppX A), and he had no income in \n2015 as he was unemployed (GX 1 at page 15). Despite having two months to do so, \nhowever, Applicant submitted nothing showing he has filed for tax years 2011~2013 and \nfor 2016; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of \nabout $3,783. (TR at page 17 line 3 to page 19 line 13, and at page 28 line 13.) Despite \nhaving two months to do so, Applicant submitted nothing showing he has addressed \nthis admitted debt; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant has failed to file his Federal tax returns, and has significant past-due \ndebt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n\n \n5 \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s failure to file several years of tax returns is \nongoing. He also has significant delinquencies. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 7, 2015. On \nJune 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 24, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \n02/25/2019\n\n2 \n \ncase on September 24, 2018. In her submission, Department Counsel amended the SOR \nby withdrawing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. On September 25, 2018, a complete copy of the file \nof relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on November 15, 2018, and did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on February 12, 2019.  \n \nThe FORM included summaries of personal subject interviews (PSI) conducted on \nJuly 13, August 25, September 27, October 28, November 18, and December 29, 2016 \n(FORM Item 10). The PSI summaries were not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to comment on the \naccuracy of the PSI summaries; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; \nor object to consideration of the PSI summaries on the ground that they were not \nauthenticated. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summaries by failing \nto respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, \nthey are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the \nDirective.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old messaging analyst employed by a defense contractor \nsince April 2015. He worked for federal contractors from November 2000 to November \n2005, was unemployed from November 2005 to December 2006, and worked for federal \ncontractors from December 2006 to December 2007, November 2009 to October 2011, \nand November 2011 to mid-2013. He left his job as a federal contractor in 2013, because \nhe had not completed required training. (FORM Item 10 at 3.) He has worked \nintermittently as an independent contractor since April 1998. When he has a full-time job, \nhe works as an independent contractor on weekends. (FORM Item 10 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant is a high school graduate. He has never married and has no children. He \nhas held a security clearance since at least November 1998 (FORM Item 10 at 5.)  \n \n \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges six delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from \nApril 2015 (FORM Item 9), February 2017 (FORM Item 7), and September 2018 (FORM \nItem 6). The evidence concerning these delinquent debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: mortgage loan past due for $16,834, in foreclosure with balance \nof $271,350. Applicant submitted no documentary evidence of the status of this debt. The \nSeptember 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt was in July 2017. \nIt is not resolved. \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 5) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: home-improvement loan charged off for $33,381. In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated that he had an agreement to pay $50 per month on this \naccount. The September 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt was \nin August 2017. He did not provide any documentary evidence of a payment agreement \nor payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $10,327. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant stated that he had a payment agreement providing for monthly $195 \npayments. The September 2018 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt \nwas in July 2017. He did not provide any documentary evidence of a payment agreement \nor payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: withdrawn. This debt was resolved before Applicant submitted his \nanswer to the SOR. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: judgment filed in 2016 for $7,962. This debt is for delinquent taxes. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his \u201ctax person\u201d is working to resolve or \nset up a payment agreement for this debt. It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: withdrawn. This debt is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: debt to local government, placed for collection of $180. In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he thought that this debt was a traffic ticket. In \nthe August 2016 PSI, he stated that it was a delinquent utility bill. (FORM Item 10 at 6.) It \nis not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: debt to fitness club, placed for collection of $125. In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated the collection account was closed and returned to the original \ncreditor. He did not provide any documentary evidence showing that the debt is resolved. \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered \u201cno\u201d to all questions asking \nwhether he had any financial delinquencies. He did not disclose any of the delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that all debts reflected in \nhis credit report were paid off before he purchased his home and that, if he had any recent \ndelinquent debts, he must have misread the question due to haste in completing the SCA. \nThe credit reports reflect that his mortgage loan was opened in April 2016, about a year \nafter he submitted his SCA. (FORM Item 6 at 2; FORM Item 7 at 1.)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted his SCA on April 7, 2015. The credit report from April 21, 2015 \nreflected five delinquent debts: (1) a credit card that was past due for $1,365, on which \nthe last activity was in October 2013; (2) a telecommunications account that was past due \nfor $564, on which the last activity was in January 2014; (3) a telecommunications account \nthat was past due for $238, on which the last activity was in October 2013; (4) a delinquent \ntraffic ticket for $180, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g; and (5) a delinquent $125 debt to a fitness \nclub, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nWhen Applicant was confronted with these debts during the August 2016 PSI, he \ntold an investigator that he did not list these debts in his SCA because he paid the $238 \ntelecommunication bill in December 2015 and paid the other debts on specific dates he \ncould not recall in 2015. (FORM Item 10 at 6-7.) The credit reports from February 2017 \nand September 2018 reflected that the delinquent credit-card account and one of the two \ndelinquent telecommunications accounts had been paid at some time after the April 2015 \ncredit report was issued, but the $564 telecommunications account and the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h were not resolved. (FORM Item 7 at 2.)  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to inadequate self-employment income \nwhen he was not employed full time between mid-2013 and April 2015. (FORM Item 10 \nat 9.) He has not provided any specific information about his income and expenses during \nhis period of unemployment, nor has he provided any specific information about his \nincome and expenses since he began his current job in April 2015. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n5 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); and \n\n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare recent, numerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. The record does not reflect whether Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to complete the training that was required for his continued employment in mid-\n2013 was a condition largely beyond his control. Even if it was beyond his control, he has \nnot acted responsibly. He resolved several delinquent debts after he submitted his SCA, \napparently because the debts were impediments to qualifying for a mortgage loan. He \nhas been employed full time for almost four years, but he produced no documentary \nevidence of significant actions to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.g, \nand 1.h.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n\n7 \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \nBased on the limited record, I am satisfied that Applicant knew he had delinquent \ndebts when he submitted his SCA. His resolution of some of the debts shortly after \nsubmitting his SCA suggests that he did not list them in his SCA because he hoped to be \nable to pay them before they became a security-clearance issue. His resolution of the \ntelecommunication bill in December 2015 reflects this state of mind at the time he \nsubmitted his SCA. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant made no effort to correct the \nomissions in his SCA until he was confronted with them during the August 2016 PSI. His \nfalsification is arguably infrequent, but it is recent and it is not \u201cminor.\u201d Falsification of a \nsecurity clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \n\n8 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and falsification of \nhis SCA. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.f: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: pro se  \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant, a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen from Senegal, does not have a foreign preference for France. \nEven though he maintains ties to Senegal and France, he has shown that he will \nresolve any potential conflicts of interest in favor of the United States. Clearance is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 24, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the foreign influence and foreign preference guidelines.1 DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether to revoke or deny \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n02/21/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a decision on the written \nrecord. However, after receiving a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated \nApril 2, 2018, he requested that his case be converted to a hearing.2 On May 22, 2018, \nDepartment Counsel fulfilled the Government\u2019s discovery obligation, confirming \nApplicant\u2019s receipt of the documents the Government intended to offer in its case \nagainst him that were appended to the FORM.3 At the hearing, convened on November \n1, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A \nthrough C, without objection.  I received the transcript (Tr.) on November 9, 2018. On \nNovember 16, 2018, I recommended this case for summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor; however, the Government objected without explanation.4  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nregarding the Republic of Senegal. Without objection from Applicant, I approved the \nrequest and the document is appended to the record as HE III.5  \n \nOn January 18, 2019, I sent the parties an email, indicating that I intended to \ntake administrative notice of facts regarding the Republic of Senegal, the Republic of \nFrance, its nationality laws, and its historical relationship with Senegal from the U.S. \nDepartment of State, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Government of the \nRepublic of France. The parties did not object, and the email and the documents are \nappended to the record as HE V through X.6 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested permission to submit additional administrative \nnotice documents in response to those I identified.  In a submission dated, February 8, \n2019,7 Department Counsel requested that I take \u201csimple notice . . . of the adjudicative \nfact that embassies are very frequently subject to deadly attacks.\u201d In support of the \nproposition, Department Counsel offered: a Wikipedia list of the attacks on diplomatic \nmissions around the world between 1829 and 2018; a Wikipedia article detailing the \n1974 attack on the French Embassy at The Hague; an excerpt of a February 2018 \narticle from the French news organization, French 24, regarding attacks on French \nembassies in Africa since 2000; and an article from Voice of America News regarding a \n                                                          \n2 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. \n \n3 HE II.  \n \n4 HE IV.  \n \n5 HE III: U.S. Department of State: Diplomacy in Action \u2013 Senegal, December 2009 \n \n6 The facts that I have taken administrative notice are from the following sources: HE V: Central \nIntelligence Agency: The World Factbook \u2013 Senegal; HE VI: U.S. Department of State: Country Reports \non Terrorism 2017; HE VII: Central Intelligence Agency: The World Factbook \u2013 France; and, HE VIII: U.S. \nDepartment of State: U.S. Relations with France. \n \n7  HE XI \n\n \n3 \n \nMarch 2018 attack on the French embassy in Burkina Faso. Applicant responded to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request as well as the proposed documents, and his comments \nare construed an an objection to their consideration. By its very nature an adjudicative \nfact is adduced from the record after the adversarial presentation of evidence and is not \nappropriate for administrative notice. Setting aside the adjudicative fact offered by \nDepartment Counsel, the supporting \ndocuments are also inappropriate for \nadministrative notice. The documents neither set forth nor are appropriate sources of \nlegislative facts - those necessary to understand a principal of law and not subject to \nevidentiary proof (e.g. official pronouncements of the President, State Department, \nDepartment of Defense, or other appropriate federal agencies on matters of national \nsecurity).8 However, the documents are appropriate for consideration as Government\u2019s \nExhibits, and will be admitted to the record as GE 3 through 6, over Applicant\u2019s \nobjection. I will consider each document and give it the appropriate weight. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 42, has worked as a senior associate for a federal contracting \ncompany since February 2015. He completed a security clearance application, his first, \nin March 2015, disclosing his family members and financial interests in Senegal as well \nas family members in France. He also disclosed part-time employment at the French \nEmbassy in the United States between 1999 and 2015. The SOR alleges the contacts \nas disqualifying under the foreign influence and foreign preference guidelines.9  \nApplicant was born in the Republic of Senegal, a secular republic with a strong \npresidency, bicameral legislature, and multiple political parties. Between 1865 and \n1960, Senegal was considered a territory of France. However, the two nations \nestablished diplomatic relations soon after Senegal gained its independence in August \n1960. Today, both France and Senegal work closely together in West African regional \naffairs, and maintain a close cultural and political relationship. However, this relationship \ndoes not provide a right to French citizenship for citizens of Senegal.10   \nSince its independence, Senegal has maintained one of the most stable \ngovernments in Africa. The country is one of the few African states that has never \nexperienced a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and throughout its history power has transferred peacefully to \nnew administrations. Senegal maintains a well-trained military that receives most of its \ntraining, equipment, and support from the United States and France, with whom \nSenegal maintains close and favorable relationships. The country has historically taken \nan active role in United Nations peacekeeping efforts throughout Africa.11  \n                                                          \n8 See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4, FN 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007). \n \n9 GE 1.  \n \n10 GE 1; HE III, HE V. \n \n11 HE III.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAccording to the most recent Country Report on Terrorism published by the U.S. \nState Department, Senegal did not experience any terror attacks in 2017. However, the \nSenegalese government arrested two individuals with suspected ties to the Islamic \nState. The Government of Senegal works closely with U.S. military and law enforcement \nofficials to strengthen its counterterrorism capabilities. The risk of terrorist activity in \nSenegal arises from external and internal factors. Externally, transnational threats arose \ndue to the Senegalese military presence in several theaters of operation in the region \nand the activities of terrorist groups in neighboring countries. Internally, the promotion of \nfundamentalist ideologies by a small number of religious leaders constituted the chief \nconcern, however, these ideologies are outside the Islamic norms that predominate in \nSenegal.12 \n \nThe Republic of France is comprised of metropolitan France and the following \nterritories: French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion. Historically, \nFrance and the United States have maintained a friendly and active relationship. The \ntwo countries share common values and have parallel polices on most political, \neconomic, and security issues. The United States and France work closely on many \nissues, including counterterrorism, efforts to end the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and on regional problems around the world.13  \n \n \nApplicant lived in Senegal with his family until his father, a now retired member of \nthe Senegalese Army, served his final tour of duty as a military attach\u00e9 at a Senegalese \nembassy between 1991 and his retirement in 1995. Applicant attended college in \nFrance from 1994 to 1998, graduating with a degree in economics. He immigrated to \nthe United States in 1999 after being awarded permanent resident status through the \ndiversity visa lottery program, which provides 55,000 permanent residents visas each \nyear to individuals from countries with a low rate of immigration to the United States.14 \nHe became a naturalized citizen in April 2005.15  \n \n \nUpon moving to the United States, Applicant entered graduate school and \nworked a series of low-paying jobs to support himself. In 1999, while visiting the French \nEmbassy to have documents translated, he saw a family friend. The friend informed \nApplicant about security positions available at the embassy. The position required \nApplicant to check identification for individuals entering the embassy, walk around the \nembassy to ensure employees left for the day, and answer after-hours phone calls from \nlocal law enforcement regarding issues with French nationals or French nationals \nneeding assistance with local enforcement. The position was not armed, as the grounds \nwere guarded by French police officers who responded to threats or suspicious \n                                                          \n12 HE VI.  \n \n13 HE VI \u2013 VIII.  \n \n14 See https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry.html \n \n15 GE 1; Tr. 19-21, 53-54. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nactivities. Applicant worked the security position part-time and attended graduate school \nfull-time between 1999 and 2002.16 \n \nHe continued the part-time position at the embassy when he began full-time \nemployment because he had grown accustomed to the busy schedule. The job was not \ndifficult, and it allowed him to accumulate savings. He reported the part-time job to each \nof his previous employers: an international bank (2003 to 2005); his current employer \n(2005 to 2013, and 2015 to present); and, an international management consulting firm \n(2013 to 2015). While completing the security clearance application, the nature of the \nquestions caused Applicant to become concerned that the part-time embassy positon \npresented a conflict of interest with having access to classified information. Around the \nsame time, the embassy considered changing the security officer role to an armed-\nguard position, which Applicant had no interest in pursuing. As a result, he resigned the \nembassy position. He ceased all ties with embassy contacts when he left the position in \n2015, including his contacts with a French police officer with whom he maintained a \ncasual friendship (SOR \u00b6 1.k).17 \n \nAside from taking advantage of the health benefits while he was a graduate \nstudent, Applicant received no other benefits from the French government during his \nemployment at the embassy. When he began working full-time in 2002, he relied on his \nemployer-offered health benefits. The embassy job did not provide Applicant a pathway \nto French citizenship. According to Applicant, the embassy treated him as a U.S. citizen, \nwhich impacted how the embassy compensated him in compliance with U.S. tax laws. \nHe paid income taxes only to the U.S. Government. The job neither created obligation \nbetween him and the French government, nor did it entitle him to receive benefits from \nthe French government.  The job did not require a security clearance or access to any \nsensitive or classified information.18  \n \n \nApplicant maintains ties to Senegal and France through his family members. His \nparents are residents and citizens of Senegal (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.b). His father, 81, no \nlonger works. After retiring from military service he briefly worked for a private \nuniversity. Applicant\u2019s mother, 73, also retired, worked as an educator. Both receive \ngovernment pensions and are financially self-sufficient. Applicant has seven siblings, \none of whom is deceased. His two oldest sisters (SOR \u00b6 1.c and 1.h), 55 and 50, \nrespectively, are residents and citizens of France. The oldest sister works as a \nconsultant, the other works as an administrator at a French financial institution. \nApplicant\u2019s two older brothers (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.e), 48 and 46, respectively, are citizens \nof Senegal and residents of France. The older brother is a construction worker and the \nyounger brother is disabled and does not work. Applicant\u2019s two younger sisters (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f and 1.g), are citizens of Senegal. The older of the two, who is 38, is a resident of \nFrance and works for a French bank. His youngest sister, 30, resides in Senegal and \n                                                          \n16 GE 1; Tr. 44-46, 49-50. \n \n17 GE 1; Tr. 35-36, 45-46. \n \n18 Tr. 48, 50-53. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nworks for a French mining company.19 Applicant also has one friend who is a citizen of \nFrance, residing in Senegal and is employed as an economist with the Senegalese \nMinistry of Finance. (SOR \u00b6 1.j).20 \n \n  \nApplicant owns property in Senegal: two parcels of land (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n) \nvalued at $14,000 (USD),  and a house (SOR \u00b6 1.o) valued at $115,000. He owns the \nproperties outright and they are managed by his youngest sister. The house is rented \nand generates approximately $600 in revenue each month. The proceeds are held in a \nSenegalese bank account (SOR \u00b6 1.l), which Applicant opened at a U.S. branch in \n2013. Applicant uses the money in the Senegalese bank account to pay for his parents\u2019 \npet projects, such as redecorating their home. He admits that in the past he has \nprovided them as much as $6,000 each year in financial support. Applicant does not \nprovide financial support to any other of his family members on a continuing basis, and \nhe does not rely on the income generated by the Senegalese properties for his ongoing \nfinancial maintenance.21  \n \n \nSince 2016, Applicant has lived and worked overseas. He is slated to continue in \nthis position until at least 2020, pending the resolution of his security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s annual compensation is approximately $200,000 and earns additional \nincome on the rental of his home while he works overseas. He has approximately \n$300,000 in retirement savings, and between $30,000 and $50,000 in stocks and other \ncash assets. He purchased his home in the United States in 2011 for approximately \n$306,000 and it is now valued at $450,000. He owes $100,000 on the mortgage loan \nand has $2,000 in other consumer debt.22  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n                                                          \n19 The SOR also alleges this sibling in SOR \u00b6 1.i. The duplicate allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n20 GE 1; Tr. 25-35, 55-56. \n \n21 Tr. 36-41. \n \n22 AE A-C; Tr. 22-24, 42-44. \n\n \n7 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites  \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nForeign Preference  \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then they may provide information or make decision that \nare harmful to the interests of the United States. Foreign involvement raises concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with \nU.S. national interests or when the individual acts to conceal it.  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s part-time employment as a security officer at \nthe French Embassy in the United States from 1999 to 2015 is evidence of Applicant\u2019s \nforeign preference for France over the United States. The Government argues that \nApplicant established a foreign preference when he chose to work for the French \nEmbassy over a U.S Government employer or enter the U.S. armed forces.23 However, \n                                                          \n23 Tr. 60.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nthe relevant disqualifying condition requires more to find a foreign preference. The \nrelevant Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(d) states that an \nApplicant acts in a way that indicates a foreign preference when he participates in \nforeign activities.  \n \nAlthough Applicant assumed employment with a foreign government, there is no \nevidence that the nature of the employment with France, a long-time ally, conflicted with \nU.S. interests. There is no evidence that the French Embassy, as suggested by the \nGovernment, is part of the \u201cstrong cultural heritage of embassies being associated with \nespionage.\u201d24 The position was not, as Department Counsel argues, akin to foreign \nmilitary service.25 The position did not make Applicant part of the French diplomatic \ncorps, armed forces, or even the armed police force responsible for the physical \nprotection of the embassy. Applicant did not swear an oath of allegiance to France. The \nposition did not provide a pathway to French citizenship, make Applicant eligible for any \nentitlements from the French government, or bestow upon him any rights or privileges of \nFrench citizenship or residency. He did not require a security clearance from the French \nGovernment, nor did the position expose him to any sensitive or classified information.  \n \nApplicant worked at the French Embassy in the United States because it \nfurthered his personal goals. Initially, he worked the part-time position because it \nprovided income and medical benefits while he attended graduate school full time \nbetween 1999 and 2002. He continued working the part-time job after earning his \ngraduate degree because it furthered his financial goals. However, when he believed \nthe job presented a potential conflict of interest with his current full-time position on a \nfederal contract, he resigned and ceased contacts with embassy employees. Also, his \nunwillingness to continue in the position if he was required carry a firearm is another \nindication that he did not have an allegiance or preference for France. Aside from \nmaintaining the part-time employment, Applicant has not acted in any other way to \ndemonstrate a foreign preference for France.  \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interests, including . . . business, financial and property \ninterests, are a national security concern if they result in a divided allegiance [or] . . . \nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d An assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign interest is located, including \nbut not limited to, consideration such as whether it is known target U.S. citizen to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s multiple ties to Senegal and France constitute \na possible foreign influence, in particular that his familial and financial ties to Senegal \nand his familial ties to France create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign influence or \n                                                          \n24 Tr. 58-59, 61-62. \n \n25 Tr. 61. \n\n \n9 \n \nexploitation because of the respective foreign tie, contact, or interest. The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member \nliving under a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country, but it is \nnonetheless a relatively low standard. The nature and strength of the family ties or other \nforeign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in \nassessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the \nadministrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the country at \nissue.26 Based on the available record, there is not a heightened risk associated with \neither country, which the Government seems to concede.27  \n \n \nHistorically, both countries maintain close ties to the United States. Neither \ncountry, nor non-governmental entities operating inside their borders, is known to \nmanipulate its citizens or ex-patriots to further their political or economic positions. \nNeither is known to be a state sponsor of terrorism. Although terrorist threats have \nbecome a greater concern in France in recent years, the United States and France have \nmaintained a favorable relationship, often working together on counterterrorism issues. \nSenegal, on the other hand, does not have history of terrorist groups operating within its \nborders, nor have U.S. interests operating in the country been a target of terrorist \norganizations.28  \n \n \nAlso, there is no heightened risk associated with Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s status as a \nretired military officer or Applicant\u2019s friend\u2019s position as an employee of the Senegalese \ngovernment as an economist. Applicant\u2019s father has been retired for 25 years and there \nis no evidence that he or Applicant maintains ongoing contact with any military or other \ngovernment officials, or that Applicant has used these contacts in a way that increases \nhis vulnerability to exploitation. Likewise, there is no evidence in the record to indicate \nthat Applicant\u2019s friend has a position or status that raises a concern.  \n \n \n \nWhile a heightened risk may not exist, his familial and financial ties to Senegal \nmay create a personal conflict of interest, or a conflict of interest between his obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology or the desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information or technology.29 However, this \nconcern is mitigated. None of his family members are currently employed by the \nSenegalese or French governments, or have positions in those societies that he will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between foreign interests and those of the \n                                                          \n26 See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \n27 Tr. 64. \n \n28 HE III, V \u2013 VIII. \n \n29 AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nUnited States.30 The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s relationships with his friend employed by \nthe Senegalese government and a police officer at the French embassy. The former \nrelationship can be classified as casual and infrequent. The latter relationship no longer \nexists. The record does not contain any evidence that either relationship could serve as \na source of vulnerability.31 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Senegalese assets do not create a conflict of interest. The assets, \nvalued at $130,000 (USD), represents 20% of his net worth. He owns the properties \noutright and is not subject to influence by any foreign financial entities. Neither Applicant \nnor his foreign family members are financially dependent on the income generated by \nthe properties. Given these facts and the nature of the Senegalese government, it is \nunlikely that the assets will result in a conflict or effectively be used to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure him. In comparison, Applicant has approximately $660,000 in \nU.S.-based assets, which include his home, retirement savings, and other financial \nassets. His debt, including his mortgage loan is approximately $102,000. He earns \nalmost $200,000 annually from his employment with a U.S.-based company. Given \nApplicant\u2019s choice to pursue U.S. citizenship and his significant financial ties to the \nUnited States, he is likely to resolve any conflict in favor of U.S. interests.32  \n \n \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect and \nhandle classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although Applicant has strong ties to Senegal and \nsome familial ties to France, the record contains sufficient evidence to mitigate any \nforeign preference and foreign influence concerns. On his own, Applicant identified a \npotential conflict of interest between his full-time employment on a federal contract and \nhis part-time employment and resolved that conflict in favor or U.S. interests. In doing \nso, he has demonstrated that he takes the concerns and responsibilities of being a \nclearance holder seriously and that he can be expected to act in accordance with U.S. \ninterests in the future.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Foreign Influence:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                                                          \n30 AG 8(a).  \n \n31 AG \u00b6 8(c).  \n \n32 AG \u00b6 8(f).  \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 16, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on June 27, 2017, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. After unsuccessful attempts to schedule the \nhearing, on January 30, 2019, Applicant changed his request to a decision on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing.  \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on April 10, 2019. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on July 19, 2019. He \nresponded to the FORM with a memorandum and documents that I have marked \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F. The case was assigned to me on August 21, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019. The Government exhibits included in the FORM and AE A through F are admitted \nin evidence without objection. On August 23, 2019, I notified Applicant that I would \nreopen the record if he wanted to submit additional documentary evidence. I reopened \nthe record upon his request. He did not submit any additional documents, but his e-\nmails contain additional information.

He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1986 \nuntil his general under honorable conditions discharge in 1994. He attended college for \na period without earning a degree. He is married for the second time, but separated \nsince about 2013. He does not have children. (Items 4, 5) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He apparently resolved the \nproblems he had in the 2000s. He attributed his recent problems to his marital \nseparation, medical issues, and a significant reduction in his salary. (Items 2, 5-10; AE \nA) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a mortgage loan that is in foreclosure; four defaulted student \nloans totaling $18,445; two delinquent debts to banks totaling $12,114; and a $1,488 \ndebt to a state. The SOR also alleges a $5,756 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) to the same bank as \nthe $7,406 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. I conclude these are duplicate allegations that \nallege the same debt. Applicant admitted owing all the non-duplicate debts, but he \nstated that he was paying some of the debts. (Item 2; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant contracted with a credit counseling company in about 2016 to assist \nhim in resolving his debts. The specifics of how long he was in the company\u2019s debt-\nmanagement plan and how much he paid are unavailable. However, when he \nresponded to the SOR in June 2017, he indicated that he had been paying debts \nthrough the plan for more than a year. (Item 2; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant indicated in his June 2017 response to the SOR that he planned to use \nhis income tax refund to pay his Department of Education student loans. It is unclear if \nanything was paid in 2017. However, in October 2018, the IRS withheld $10,752 from \nhis income tax refund and applied it to his student loans. The April 2019 credit report \nlisted the total balance of the four student loans as $9,756. In July 2019, the IRS \nwithheld another $8,675 from his income tax refund and applied it to his student loans. \n(Items 2, 7-10; AE A, C-E) \n \n \nApplicant started payments to the state for the $1,488 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i \nin 2017. He paid the debt in full in November 2017. (Items 2, 7-10; AE A, B) \n \n \nApplicant wrote in his June 2017 response to the SOR that he had been paying \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h through the debt-management plan for about a year. He \ndid not submit documentation of the actual payments, but the credit reports support his \n\n \n3 \n \nassertion. The April 2016 credit report lists the balance of the debt as $7,408. The three \nsubsequent credit reports list the balance as $5,756 in March 2017; $4,584 in August \n2017; and $3,268 in April 2019. The evidence for the $4,706 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d \nis similar to the above. The balance in 2017 was $4,706. In April 2019, the balance was \n$3,647. (Items 2, 7-10; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant bought a house for $248,500 in 2007. The purchase was financed by a \njoint mortgage loan. It appears that the house was mainly for his wife to live in, as he \nhas lived primarily in Japan since 2006. He lived in the house for about five months in \n2008 to 2009, before returning to Japan. The creditor initiated foreclosure proceedings, \nbut agreed to a short sale. The house was sold for $229,458 in August 2018, which was \nless than what was owed on the mortgage loan. There is no indication that the creditor \nis seeking the deficiency owed on the loan. (Items 2, 4, 7-10; AE A, F) \n \n \nApplicant stated that his finances are greatly improved. He plans to continue \npaying his debts. He will increase the payments to the two remaining consumer debts \nafter the student loans are paid. He expects to be completely debt free within two years. \n(Item 2; AE A, G) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and a \nforeclosed mortgage loan. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h are duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005). SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his recent financial problems to his marital separation, \nmedical issues, and a significant reduction in his salary. Those events were beyond his \ncontrol. \n \n \nApplicant has been paying his debts for several years. He paid the $1,488 debt \nto the state in 2017. His four defaulted student loans have been reduced from $18,445 \nto what appears to be less than $1,200. The balances on his two consumer debts have \nbeen reduced from $7,408 to $3,268, and from $4,706 to $3,647. His mortgage loan \nhas been resolved by a short sale. His finances are greatly improved. He plans to \ncontinue paying his debts. He expects to be completely debt free within two years.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were paid through a withholding of his income tax \nrefunds. He does not receive as much credit in mitigation, as he would have if he paid \nthem voluntarily. However, I also note that he did not change his withholding to lower \nthe amount withheld from his paychecks.  \n \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \n\n \n6 \n \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to address his \nremaining debts. I find that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took \nsignificant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances \nand made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. The above mitigating conditions are \nsufficiently applicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Young, Esq. \n04/23/2019\n___________ \nDecision \n___________ \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant had two alcohol-related driving offenses, was impaired by alcohol on \nduty, and engaged in an alcohol-related disorderly conduct. He was diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent in 2009 and alcohol-use disorder in 2012. He made some positive steps \ntowards rehabilitation; however, security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption) are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.     \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 25, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) On October 5, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. The SOR set forth \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline G. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nOn November 20, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing.

(Tr. 46) He said he \nnever had a security violation. (Tr. 46) He denied that his alcohol consumption affected \nhis work performance. (Tr. 47) \n \nAlcohol Consumption  \n \nThe SOR alleges the following conduct of security significance. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges in August 2004, Applicant was arrested for and convicted of \ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Applicant drove after consuming alcohol and \nhit a guard rail. (Tr. 58) He was in Army advanced individual training or AIT when he was \n                                            \n1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

(Tr. 62, 64)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s commander imposed nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15, \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), for the August 2004 DUI. His punishment \nincluded 45 days of extra duty, and his commander required him to attend the Army \nSubstance Abuse Program (ASAP). (Tr. 62-64; GE 7 at \u00b6 1) After completion of AIT, the \nArmy assigned Applicant to a unit in Germany. (Tr. 62)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges in November 2006, Applicant was charged with drunk on duty \nand wrongful distribution of hallucinogens. His NJP included a reduction in rank. As to the \ndrunk on duty offense, Applicant said a sergeant relieved him from duty on New Year\u2019s \nEve. (Tr. 67) He and some other soldiers left the barracks and went to a club, where he \nconsumed alcohol. (Tr. 67) He returned to the barracks and went to sleep. (Tr. 67) The \nfirst sergeant, and the sergeant who released him from duty, came to Applicant\u2019s barracks \nroom. The first sergeant asked Applicant why he was not on duty, and Applicant did not \nrespond to his question because he believed he would not be believed if he said the \nsergeant with the first sergeant released him from duty. (Tr. 67, 113) Applicant\u2019s unit \nreferred him to the ASAP. (Tr. 68, 112) He successfully completed ASAP. (Tr. 68-70; GE \n7 at \u00b6 1) Applicant denied that he was under the influence of alcohol on duty, and he \nclaimed that he was not under the influence of alcohol. (Tr. 69) He believed he was \nunfairly accused of being drunk on duty. (Tr. 70)  \n \nThe allegation of wrongful distribution of hallucinogens was made against \nApplicant several months after the drunk on duty accusation was made. (Tr. 71) An \nairman, who tested positive in a urinalysis test for use of Ecstasy, said Applicant provided \nan Ecstasy pill to him. (Tr. 71; GE 6 at 2-3) Applicant consented to the search of his room \nin the barracks, and the searcher found three Ecstasy pills in the drawer under Applicant\u2019s \nbed. (Tr. 72; GE 6 at 2) Applicant said others had access to his room and must have \nplaced the Ecstasy pills into his drawer. Applicant said he provided statements to the \nArmy Criminal Investigation Command from witnesses who said they did not see \nApplicant commit drug offenses. (Tr. 74-75, 132) Applicant\u2019s commander imposed NJP \nincluding a reduction in grade, forfeiture of half a month\u2019s pay for two months, and extra \nduty. (Tr. 73; GE 14) Applicant said the colonel who imposed the NJP told him that he \nbelieved Applicant; however, he had to punish Applicant to show illegal drugs are not \ntolerated \u201cwhether [he] did it or not.\u201d (Tr. 73, 133-134) Applicant accused the colonel of \npunishing him even though Applicant was innocent. (Tr. 134) Applicant denied his \ninvolvement with illegal drugs. (Tr. 74) Applicant did not provide a statement from anyone \nbesides himself corroborating his assertion that the colonel said he was innocent, but \npunished him anyway. He did not provide proof to support his claim that the colonel \nviolated his rights by knowingly and improperly punishing him for a crime he did not \ncommit.       \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges in August 2008, Applicant voluntarily referred himself for \ntreatment in ASAP. Applicant did not recall his self-referral for treatment in ASAP. (Tr. 76, \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \n78; GE 7) Applicant was diagnosed in March 2009, as alcohol dependent. (Tr. 76, 131; \nGE 5; GE 7)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges in June 2009, Applicant was charged with DUI, simple assault, \nand disorderly conduct. Applicant got into an altercation after consuming alcohol. He \npleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, and the DUI and assault charges were dismissed.  \n \nIn 2009, Applicant was with a friend at a bar. (Tr. 79) Applicant drank four or five \nstrong drinks, and Applicant admitted he was intoxicated. (Tr. 80-81) Applicant was the \nonly Black person in the bar, and a man came up to Applicant, asked him for a cigarette, \nand called him a n _ _ _ _ r. (Tr. 82) More words were exchanged, and Applicant left the \nbar and went to the parking lot. (Tr. 83) Applicant described his own conduct in the bar \nas reasonable and peaceful. In the parking lot outside the bar, the man insulted Applicant \nagain and tried to punch Applicant. (Tr. 83) Applicant hit the man in the face, and the man \nhit his head on the ground. (Tr. 83) Someone tackled Applicant and knocked Applicant \ndown. Others kicked Applicant and his friend while they were down. (Tr. 83-84) Applicant \nsaid, \u201cI heard the whole, entire bar . . .

(Tr. 84) Applicant and his friend left in his friend\u2019s vehicle. (Tr. 84) A short \ntime later, the police arrested Applicant and his friend. (Tr. 85) Applicant did not recall \nwhether a blood alcohol test (BAT) was administered, and Applicant denied that he was \ndriving. (GE 3 at 7) The police told Applicant that the person Applicant punched had \u201ca \npretty bad gash on his head.\u201d (Tr. 85) According to the notice of preliminary hearing, \nApplicant was charged with simple assault, disorderly conduct, DUI/high rate of alcohol \n.10-.16, and DUI/Gen IMP/INCAP of driving safely. (GE 8)  Applicant\u2019s friend was charged \nwith DUI, simple assault, and disorderly conduct. (Tr. 86) Applicant pleaded guilty to \ndisorderly conduct, and the other charges were withdrawn. (Tr. 88; GE 8) He received \ncourt fees totaling $229. (Tr. 88; GE 8) Applicant\u2019s record was subsequently expunged. \n(Tr. 88; AE A)   \n \n  On March 2, 2009, an Army social worker and ASAP Clinical Director evaluated \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption. (GE 7) She indicated he met three of seven criteria for \nalcohol dependence, and his beer consumption during ASAP established a fourth criteria. \n(GE 7)2 The Clinical Director indicated that his diagnosis of alcohol dependence \u201cbecame \n                                            \n2 In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association issued the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders (DSM\u2013IV-TR).  This manual indicates that if three of the following seven criteria are met \nin the previous year, a diagnosis of alcohol dependence is warranted. The seven criteria are as follows: \n \nHad to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want? Or found that your \nusual number of drinks had much less effect than before? \n \nFound that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off, you had withdrawal symptoms, \nsuch as trouble sleeping, shakiness, restlessness, nausea, sweating, a racing heart, or a \nseizure? Or sensed things that were not there? \n \nHad times when you ended up drinking more, or longer, than you intended? \n \nMore than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn\u2019t? \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \na point of contention for [Applicant] and he spent a number of weeks fixated on this and \nhis adamant disagreement with same.\u201d (GE 6 at \u00b6 2) Applicant claimed the ASAP Clinical \nDirector said that \u201cAnyone that has two sittings a year drinking alcohol, and in those two \nsittings drink[s] more than two drinks, is considered an alcoholic.\u201d (Tr. 98, 118, 123) \nApplicant denied that he was an \u201calcoholic\u201d; however, he said he did \u201cbinge drink.\u201d (Tr. \n98, 111-112) He said the statement in the Clinical Director\u2019s report that he drank half a \nbeer while in ASAP was false, but that she was not lying. (Tr. 134-135) He did not recall \nadmitting to her that he drank beer while in ASAP. (Tr. 135) Applicant said he was \nunaware of the diagnosis of alcohol dependency. (Tr. 126) He characterized the Clinical \nDirector as \u201cmean,\u201d \u201cvery attacking,\u201d \u201cvery abusive,\u201d and \u201cvery manipulating.\u201d (Tr. 122, \n134) He said she told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you. I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d (Tr. 134) He denied \nthat anyone told him not to drink alcohol. (Tr. 119)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges in September 2011, Applicant was charged with DUI. After \nattending a civilian substance abuse program, the charge in state court was dismissed.  \nIn May 2012, Applicant\u2019s command charged him with operating a vehicle while drunk \nunder Article 111, UCMJ. He was discharged from the service in lieu of courts-martial, \nand he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. \n \nIn September 2011, Applicant and his spouse were both drinking alcohol before \nthey started to drive home. (Tr. 31-32) Applicant was asked how much he had to drink, \nand he said he had a \u201cdrink or two\u201d or \u201cat least two drinks that evening.\u201d (Tr. 91) Applicant \nsaid he did not feel intoxicated. (Tr. 91) Applicant fell asleep while driving to their home \nand hit a tree. (Tr. 32-33, 89) Applicant received serious burns to his legs and had multiple \nbroken bones. (Tr. 23-24, 44, 89-90) He was in a coma for six days and in the hospital \nfor about four months. (Tr. 23-24, 90) His spouse attributed the accident to Applicant\u2019s \nsevere sleep apnea and being tired. (Tr. 33) Applicant\u2019s records indicate he had a BAT; \nhowever, Applicant said he did not remember the result. (Tr. 91; GE 3 at 5) A letter of \nreprimand from a major general indicates that a police officer at the scene of the accident \n\u201cnoted a strong odor of alcohol coming from [Applicant\u2019s] breath and person,\u201d and he had \na BAT result of a .14 blood alcohol content (BAC). (AE B at \u00b6 1) The state dismissed the \nDUI charge. (Tr. 92)  \n \nThe Army preferred a charge of drunk driving against Applicant. (Tr. 93, 136) \nApplicant said his lawyer convinced him that he could not get a fair trial in the military \nbecause \u201c[t]he Army has deep pockets,\u201d \u201cthey are known to get on the witness stand and \nlie,\u201d and \u201c[t]here is no way you could win this.\u201d (Tr. 94-95) He was convinced he was \n                                            \nSpent a lot of time drinking? Or being sick or getting over other aftereffects? \n \nGiven up or cut back on activities that were important or interesting to you, or gave you \npleasure, in order to drink? \n \nContinued to drink even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to \nanother health problem?

(Tr. 138)   \n \nApplicant was a sergeant (E-5) before being reduced to private (E-1) through an \nadministrative reduction related to being charged with operating a vehicle while drunk and \nreceipt of a discharge under Chapter 10 of Army Regulation 635-200. (Tr. 45, 95) He \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 45-46, 97)3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges from about February 2012 to July 2012, Applicant received \ntreatment at an ASAP. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence. Applicant self- \nreferred himself to ASAP. (Tr. 126) He said he decided not to get drunk anymore. (Tr. \n127) Applicant said he successfully completed ASAP. (GE 1) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant continues to consume alcohol notwithstanding his \ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence. Applicant said he ended his alcohol consumption in \nJune 2017. (Tr. 104) He also said he stopped drinking alcohol after the accident in 2011 \nor his alcohol consumption was \u201cclose to none\u201d until his birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 104-\n105) He said he did not drink alcohol and drive after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 105) He \nclaimed he did not drink alcohol while he was in ASAP. (Tr. 120-121) He denied that he \nwas alcohol dependent. (Tr. 129) There is no evidence that Applicant currently consumes \nalcohol, and SOR \u00b6 1.g is not substantiated. \n \nApplicant denied receipt of the January 14, 2010 memorandum from the Army \nCentral Personnel Security Clearance Facility (CPSCF) granting his access to sensitive \ncompartmented information and top secret information, and warning him not to have any \nfuture incidents involving alcohol, criminal conduct, or other unfavorable information \nbecause it may result in suspension of his security clearance. (Tr. 124; GE 12) There is \nno receipt signed by Applicant in the file showing Applicant received the January 14, 2010 \nArmy CPSCF memorandum. (GE 12)    \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse said the last time she observed him consuming alcohol was on \nhis birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 20) She said on that occasion, he drank one half of a glass \nof wine. (Tr. 20, 37) Applicant said he had \u201ctwo glasses of wine on [his] birthday.\u201d (Tr. \n128) After the accident in 2011, he seldom consumed alcohol and not to intoxication. (Tr. \n21) His alcohol-related accident in 2011 was a shock to him, and he changed. (Tr. 21) He \ndenied that he drank to intoxication after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 128) He denied drinking \nalcohol after his birthday in June 2017. (Tr. 129) His spouse maintains wine in her house. \n(Tr. 22) In 2015, Applicant and his spouse were baptized, and his church is available to \n                                            \n3 Applicant denied that he admitted the offense as part of the discharge process or he did not \nremember admitting an offense carrying a bad-conduct discharge. (Tr. 136-137) Under Army Regulation \n(AR) 635-200, Active Duty Enlisted Administrative Separations, Chapter 10, paragraph 10-2e, \u201cThe \nSoldier\u2019s written request will also include an acknowledgment that he/she understands the elements of the \noffense (s) charged and is guilty of the charge(s) or of a lesser included offense(s) therein contained which \nalso \nauthorizes \nthe \nimposition \nof \na \npunitive \ndischarge. \n(See \nfig \n10\u20131, \npara \n2.),\u201d \nhttps://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR pubs/DR a/pdf/web/AR635-200 Web FINAL 18JAN2017 .pdf. The \nrequirement for this admission of guilt to a serious offense has been part of AR 635-200, Chapter 10 for \nmore than 30 years. When a Chapter 10 discharge is approved, the soldier being discharged is \nadministratively reduced to private E-1. \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nhim as a support system.

(Tr. 38) He said he \u201ctook \nresponsibility\u201d for his conduct. (Tr. 70, 140-141) \n \nOn September 9, 2016, an Officer Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant about his history of alcohol consumption. (GE 3) The summary of \nthe OPM interview states: \n \nIn 2009 or 2010; Subject could not be more specific, Subject found [G]od \nand dedicated himself to his family and Subject\u2019s drinking decreased to its \ncurrent level of three to four mixed drinks over a five to six hour time period \nonce or twice per year during the holidays. . . . Subject has no intent on \nchanging his drinking habits in the future. (GE 3 at 11)    \n \nApplicant said he had changed after the accident in 2011. (Tr. 100) \u201c[He] had an \nout-of-body experience where [he] met the Creator.\u201d (Tr. 100) The Creator held Applicant \nby the neck over a fire and said, \u201cIs this what you want?\u201d (Tr. 101) He responded that he \nwanted a second chance, and he woke up in the hospital. (Tr. 101) Applicant believed he \nhealed from his injuries \u201cat a supernatural rate.\u201d (Tr. 101-102) He considers himself to be \nhonest, responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. (Tr. 107) \n \nIn sum, Applicant successfully completed ASAP in April 2005, January 2009, and \nFebruary 2012. (AE D) He has never had a positive urinalysis for use of illegal drugs. (AE \nD) In 2012, he was diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder. (AE D) In February 2012, he \nmade a commitment to abstain from alcohol use. (AE D) At his hearing, he promised to \nabstain from alcohol consumption in the future.   \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nBefore Applicant deployed to Iraq with a task force, his colonel said \u201cwe were going \nto lose 40 \u2013 almost half, 44 percent, which we did lose half.\u201d (Tr. 66) Applicant said he \nwas a gunner for \u201cover 279 missions.\u201d (Tr. 66) His \u201cmind state was that I\u2019m going to die, \nbut if I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m going to die honorably, and just, you know for my brothers and \nsisters that wear the flag.\u201d (Tr. 66)  \n \nWhile in Iraq, Applicant said he received multiple Combat Action Badges (CAB).4 \nHe explained why he only had one CAB in his records as follows: \n                                            \n4 I decline to credit Applicant with receipt of more than one Combat Action Badge. The Army Human \nRelations Command website states: \n \nSubsequent award of the CAB is not authorized during the same qualifying period. The \nqualifying period is defined as the contingency/conflict for which the Secretary of the Army \nauthorized combat badges is awarded. Currently, the only qualifying period for award of \nthe CAB is the GWOT. OEF, OIF, and OND are operations within the GWOT \ncontingency/conflict. Therefore, no matter how many times a Soldier rotates to the theater, \nonly one award of each combat badge is authorized. (For example, a Soldier who engages \nin combat with the enemy during OIF I, OEF III, and OIF V will only receive one CAB.). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nAnd I remember throwing them down. I was, like, I\u2019m tired of these combat \naction badges. And I remember throwing them down and walking away \nbecause I was upset about . . . all the combat, the killing. And I said, I\u2019m \ntired of you giving me awards for killing all these people. And I just walked \naway, and I said, you know. Give me money for the combat action badges, \nbecause I saw no value to it. (Tr. 139) \n \nHe indicated records were burned in the trunk of his car during the accident in 2011. (Tr. \n139-140) He did not provide corroborative evidence that he was a gunner for \u201cover 279 \nmissions,\u201d that he was assigned to a unit that sustained a high percentage of combat \ncasualties, or that he was awarded multiple CABs. \n \nApplicant said that after he came back from Iraq, he described symptoms of having \npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a doctor \u201cthrew some pills at [him]\u201d and told \nhim he would be fine in three months. (Tr. 77) Applicant threw the pills in the trash. (Tr. \n77) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) decided that he had a disability rating of 90 \npercent, which included 30 percent for PTSD. (Tr. 135; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DD Form 214 indicates he has the following medals, badges, and \nribbons: Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM); Army Achievement Medal (AAM) (6th \nAward); Army Superior Unit Award (ASUA); Army Good Conduct Medal (AGCM); National \nDefense Service Medal (NDSM); Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWTSM); Iraq \nCampaign Medal with Campaign Star (ICMCS); Noncommissioned Officer Professional \nDevelopment Ribbon (NCOPDR) (2nd Award); Army Service Ribbon (ASR); Overseas \nService Ribbon (OSR) (2nd Award); Combat Action Badge (CAB); and Certificate of \nAchievement (COR). (GE 4; AE G) He completed multiple military training courses. (GE \n4) He served in Iraq from August 2006 to October 2007. (GE 4) He also served an \noverseas tour in Germany.    \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant received an excellent performance evaluation from his \nemployer. (AE E) He also received some excellent evaluation reports when he was in the \nArmy. (AE F) Applicant was the distinguished honor graduate of a course. (Tr. 47) He \nprovided award certificates and orders for several medals and one CAB as listed on his \nDD Form 214. (AE F) Letters of recommendation from his spouse, supervisors, friends, \nand colleagues lauded Applicant\u2019s intelligence, diligence, positive attitude, enthusiasm, \nhonesty, friendliness, athleticism when he was younger, and professionalism. (AE H) \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \n                                            \nU.S. Army Human Relations website, The Adjutant General Directorate(TAGD), Combat Action \nBadge, https://www.hrc.army.mil/TAGD/Combat%20Action%20Badge%20CAB.  \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \napplicant\u2019s personal or professional history that may disqualify the applicant for eligibility \nfor access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, \n1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions under the alcohol consumption guideline that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying including: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) through 22(d) apply. The SOR does not allege evidence to support \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e), 22(f), and 22(g). Applicant\u2019s four alcohol-related incidents involving the \npolice, courts, or his command occurred from 2004 to 2011. His BAC for three of the four \nalcohol-related incidents is unknown. His BAC for the 2011 DUI was .14. He was impaired \nby alcohol in 2006 when he was supposed to be on duty. His .14 BAC established that \nhe engaged in binge alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment.5 In 2009, \n                                            \n5 \u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United States.\u201d See \nthe Center for Disease Control website, (stating \u201cThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nhe was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, and in 2012, he was diagnosed with alcohol-\nuse disorder. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly \nlengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at \n3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 08-\n04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial of security clearance for Applicant with \nalcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior to hearing). For example, in ISCR \nCase No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board reversed the \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB \nhad several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, \nsix years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \n                                            \ndefines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to \n0.08 grams percent or above.

The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving \ncase with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and reversing \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \nI have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. Applicant presented some \nevidence supporting mitigation of alcohol consumption concerns. Applicant successfully \ncompleted ASAP in April 2005, January 2009, and February 2012. He has never had a \npositive urinalysis for use of illegal drugs. In February 2012, he made a commitment to \nabstain from alcohol use; however, he occasionally drank alcohol until his birthday in \n2017. He has not had any alcohol-related incidents involving the police or courts since \nhis DUI resulting in serious injury in 2011.    \n \nSeveral factors weigh against mitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns: \n(1) Applicant\u2019s four alcohol-related offenses; (2) his reluctance to permanently abstain \nfrom alcohol consumption; (3) his binge alcohol consumption to the extent of having a .14 \nBAC; (4) his diagnosis  of alcohol abuse; (5) his resumption of alcohol consumption after \nprevious periods of abstinence and SARP attendances; and (6) credibility issues relating \nto his pejorative allegations against his battalion commander who imposed NJP for his \ndistribution of Ecstasy, allegations against his defense attorney, including claims that he \ncould not receive a fair trial from the Army, and his complaints about the Clinical Director \nbeing out to get him and using improper criteria for evaluating him in 2009. I have lingering \ndoubts and concerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment pertaining to his history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption security \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. \u201cIn evaluating an applicant\u2019s case, a \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nJudge must carefully consider the record as a whole. This includes not only considering the \nextent to which an applicant\u2019s circumstances raise concerns about his or her reliability but \nalso giving fair consideration of the applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-\n09900 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00424 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. \n20, 2016)). My comments under Guideline G are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, and he is employed as a senior systems security \nspecialist. He has an associate\u2019s degree in computer science. In 2015, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in systems security. He is in the process of obtaining his certification \nas an information systems manager. He has a strong resume in communications security \nand information technology.  \n \nApplicant served in the Army from 2004 to July 2012. He was a senior \ncommunications security repair specialist.

Applicant\u2019s DD Form 214 \nindicates he has the following medals, badges, and ribbons: ARCOM; AAM (6th Award); \nASUA; AGCM; NDSM; GWTSM; ICMCS; NCOPDR (2nd Award); ASR; OSR (2nd \nAward); CAB; and COR. He completed multiple military training courses. He successfully \ncompleted overseas tours in Germany and most importantly served in Iraq from August \n2006 to October 2007. The VA has awarded him a 90 percent disability rating including \n30 percent for PTSD. He received excellent performance evaluations, and he provided \ncharacter letters praising his intelligence, diligence, positive attitude, enthusiasm, \nhonesty, friendliness, athleticism when he was younger, and professionalism.   \n \nThe evidence weighing against grant of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information \nis more persuasive:  (1) his four alcohol-related offenses (DUIs in 2004 and 2011-the \n2011 DUI resulted in serious injury; impaired by alcohol for duty in 2006; and disorderly \nconduct in 2009 resulting in injury); (2) his reluctance to permanently abstain from alcohol \nconsumption; (3) his binge alcohol consumption to the extent of .14 BAC in 2011; (4) his \ndiagnosis  of alcohol abuse in 2012; (5) his resumption of alcohol consumption after \nprevious periods of abstinence and SARP attendance; and (6) credibility issues where he \nmade excuses and did not accept full responsibility for his conduct as indicated by his \nclaims that his battalion commander improperly imposed NJP for his distribution of \nEcstasy and his Clinical Director improperly diagnosed him as alcohol dependent \nbecause she was out to get him. Based on these factors, I have lingering doubts and \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. A \nsignificant probability of alcohol-related judgment errors in the future continues to exist, \nand his lengthy history of alcohol consumption raises ongoing questions about his \nreliability and trustworthiness. See AG \u00b6 21.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as \nset forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that Guideline G security \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He filed all of his overdue returns, paid all federal \ntaxes owed, and is complying with his state\u2019s tax payment agreement. He has been \nacting responsibly under the circumstances. His financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control. The omissions in his 2015 security clearance application (SCA) \nwere not deliberate. Clearance granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an SCA on February 25, 2015, seeking to continue the \nclearance required for his position with a federal contractor. He was interviewed by a \ngovernment background investigator in June and November 2016, and answered a set \nof interrogatories in June 2017. (GE 2) After reviewing the information gathered during \nthe background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 31, 2017, alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on September 15, 2017, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \n04/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 18, 2018, who \nconvened a hearing on August 29, 2018. At the hearing, the administrative judge \nadmitted three documents as Hearing Exhibits (HE I-III). (Tr. 12-15) The Government \noffered six exhibits (GE 1 through 6). (Tr. 15) Applicant testified and submitted five \nexhibits (AE 1 through 5). (Tr. 6-7, and 16) All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 7, 2018. \n \nFollowing the hearing, the administrative judge developed an ongoing medical \ncondition that prevented her from writing a decision. DOHA reassigned the case to me \non February 27, 2019, to expedite the clearance process. On March 1, 2019, I notified \nthe parties that the case was reassigned to me. I provided Applicant the opportunity to \nrequest a new hearing, or to agree for me to write a decision based on the record, \nincluding the August 29, 2018 transcript and all evidence submitted at the hearing. \nBecause of the elapsed period, I allowed the parties the opportunity to supplement the \nrecord with additional documentary evidence. (See HE IV \u2013 email notice to the parties.) \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s response included a recent credit report from March 2019. \nThe credit report were marked as GE 4 and made part of the record. Applicant\u2019s emails \nagreeing to me issuing the decision based on the established record were marked AE 6 \nand admitted.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nAt hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the third line in SOR \u00b6 2.b by \nchanging the date \u201cMay 2016\u201d to read \u201cMay 2015.\u201d Without objections, the motion was \ngranted as requested. (Tr. 6) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011, 2014, and 2016; and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2013 and 2014. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, respectively.) Under Guideline E, the \nSOR alleged that Applicant failed twice to adhere to court-ordered alcohol abstinence in \n2015. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) It further alleged that Applicant falsified his 2015 SCA when \nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) and failed to disclose \nthat he did not timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2014, and 2016; \nand state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) \n \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 2.c. He denied SOR \u00b6 2.a, but at his hearing, Applicant amended his SOR Answer \nand admitted the allegation. (Tr. 71) He denied SOR \u00b6 2.b. His admissions to the SOR \nand at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of \nthe record evidence, including his testimony and all evidence admitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He received a \nGeneral Education Development (GED) certificate in 1978. Since then, he has \ncompleted numerous job-related technical certifications. He has never been married, \nand has no children.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows that he has worked for different federal \ncontractors since 1990. He has held a secret clearance continuously since the early \n1990s. His current employer and security sponsor hired him in July 2014. \n \nApplicant explained that his failure to file 2011 income tax returns resulted from \nmedical problems in 2011-2012 (diagnosed with cancer). He received treatment during \ntwo years, but he is now considered to be in remission. (Tr. 20-22) Additionally, in 2014, \nhe withdrew $50,000 from his 401k retirement account to buy a home. He was not \naware of the tax penalties associated with an early withdrawal of 401k monies, and the \nadditional income placed him in a higher tax bracket. Applicant claimed that he \nprepared the 2014 federal income tax return, but did not file it because he did not have \nthe money to pay the tax owed. Apparently, he also failed to file his 2016 federal income \ntax return and his state tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014 because he did not \nhave the money to pay the taxes owed. He averred that unexpected maintenance costs \nfor his new home were so high that he did not have the money to pay his owed taxes \nand did not file his income tax returns. (Tr. 22-23) \n \nApplicant also stated during his 2016 interview with a government investigator \nthat he did not file his 2014 and 2016 income tax returns because he moved \nresidences, and he could not find his documents. He was not diligent about filing \nbecause he believed it was not a big deal since he believed that he owed no taxes. He \npromised the investigator that he would promptly file his 2014 and 2015 income tax \nreturns, and he did. (GE 2) \n \nAfter his 2016 interview, Applicant became scared about the concerns raised by \nhis failure to file his 2014 income tax returns and hired a tax preparer to do so. He filed \nhis 2014 federal income tax return in February 2017, and in June 2017, he paid the IRS \n$27,000 for back taxes. (Tr. 100) At his hearing, Applicant testified he had filed all of his \noverdue returns and he owed no back taxes to the IRS. \n \nAlthough Applicant requested tax return transcripts for tax years 2008 \u2013 2010, \nthe IRS no longer has those records. The IRS Wage and Income Transcript form for tax \nyear 2011 (prepared in 2017) shows that Applicant filed his 2010 income tax return and \nreceived a $53 refund. The IRS Wage and Income Transcript form for tax year 2011 \ndoes not indicate that Applicant filed his 2011 income tax return. (Only the first page \nwas submitted and it appears to be a multipage document.) He provided no \ndocumentary evidence to show he filed it, but implied that he did. (Tr. 33) During his \n2016 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he did not file his 2011 income tax \nreturn, and when confronted by the IRS about it, and threatened with a garnishment of \nwages, Applicant agreed to the garnishment of wages to satisfy the 2011 tax debt. (GE \n2, Tr. 77-81) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2012 federal income tax return in October 2013. He filed his \n2013 federal income tax return in April 2014. He filed his 2014 federal income tax return \nin February 2017. Apparently, he filed his 2015 income tax return between 2016 and \n2017. He requested a 2015 tax transcript, but the IRS informed him that there was an \nidentity theft issue with that year\u2019s return. (GE 2) He filed his 2016 federal income tax \nreturn on June 26, 2017. (GE 2) \n \nConcerning his 2013 and 2014 state income tax returns, Applicant testified he \nfiled them late and paid off any taxes due for tax year 2013. He still owes about $2,000 \nfor tax year 2014, but has been making $150 monthly payments as agreed. (Tr. 35) \n \nSection 26 (Financial Record - Taxes) of the 2015 SCA, asked Applicant to \ndisclose whether in the last seven years he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or \nother taxes when required by law. Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose that \nhe did not timely file a federal income tax return for tax year 2011, and a state income \ntax return for tax year 2013. I note that Applicant submitted the 2015 SCA in February \n2015. Thus, at that time, the only late returns would have been the 2011 federal return \nand the 2013 state return.  \n \nApplicant admitted that he provided an inaccurate response in his 2015 SCA, but \naverred that he is an honest person who made an inadvertent and honest mistake. \nApplicant explained he had submitted an SCA before he failed to file his income tax \nreturns in 2011, and before he was charged with DUI in 2014. (The prior SCA is not part \nof the record.) When his employer\u2019s FSO found out about his 2014 DUI charge, \nApplicant was asked to update the prior SCA with the DUI information. Because he was \nnot asked to update the whole SCA, he only updated the DUI questions, and did not \nlook at or update any other SCA sections, including the questions about his failure to file \nincome tax returns. Applicant highlighted that when he was asked during his 2016 \ninterview about his tax problems, he promptly disclosed that he had failed to file his \nfederal income tax returns for 2011 and 2014; the state returns for 2013 and 2014; and \nhe disclosed that he had identity theft issues with his 2015 tax return. (Ge 2, Tr. 24-25) \n \nRegarding the SOR allegations that Applicant failed twice to adhere to court-\nordered alcohol abstinence in 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b), I find that the evidence is \ninsufficient to establish SOR \u00b6 2.b. Applicant explained that the court ordered him to \nabstain from alcohol consumption while undergoing alcohol counseling. Applicant \nadmitted that during his counseling period, he took a urinalysis screening for alcohol in \nhis system and failed once. (GE 5) He denied that the Interlock device in his vehicle \nwas ever fully triggered. He repeatedly stated that the device had a false positive on \none occasion, but that the Interlock device was not activated. When he retried the \nInterlock device after five minutes, the car started. After Applicant\u2019s compliance with the \nother terms of his sentence, the charge for violating the terms of his probation was \ndismissed. (Tr. 75, GE 5) \n \nApplicant considers himself to be honest, reliable, hardworking, and a key player \nwithin his company. He believes he will be devastated if he was to lose his clearance \n\n \n5 \n \n \neligibility because he would likely lose his job, and at his age it would be difficult to get a \nnew job. His references consider Applicant to be honest, trustworthy, dedicated, \nhardworking, and a competent and valuable employee. They endorsed his eligibility for \na clearance. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he made a mistake when he failed to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns because he did not have the money to pay the \ntaxes owed. He acknowledged he should have been more diligent about filing the \nincome tax returns. He believes that he has learned a valuable lesson. He understands \nthe seriousness of the security concerns raised by his tax problems. He promised to \ntimely file and pay his taxes in the future. Applicant highlighted his 40 years of \nemployment with federal contractors while holding a clearance since 1990s. He believes \nthat his financial situation is now stable.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2014, \nand 2016; and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014. He explained he \nfailed to file his 2011 income tax returns because of health problems. Apparently, when \nconfronted by the IRS about his failure to file and threatened with a garnishment of \nwages, he agreed to the garnishment and paid the taxes owed. \n \nApplicant provided several reasons for his failure to timely file his federal tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 and 2016; and his state tax returns for tax years 2013 and \n2014: medical problems related to his cancer diagnosis and treatment; the purchase of \na home in 2014; and moving residences and not being able to find his documents. He \nstated that in 2014 his taxes were complicated because he withdrew $50,000 from his \n401k retirement account to purchase a home. He was unaware of the penalties \nassociated with the early withdrawal of monies from the retirement account, and he \nended up in a higher tax bracket.  \n \nApplicant testified that he prepared his own 2014 tax return, but when he realized \nhe did not have the money to pay the taxes owed, he did not file it. After his 2016 \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninterview, Applicant hired a professional tax preparer, and filed his 2014 federal income \ntax return in February 2017. In June 2017, he paid the IRS $27,000 for back taxes owed \nfor 2014. He wanted to clear any possible security concerns about him owing taxes as \nsoon as possible. As of his hearing, Applicant had filed all federal (except for 2011) and \nstate tax returns and claimed he owed no back taxes to the IRS. He is in a payment \nagreement with the state authorities for taxes owed for 2014. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \n\u201c(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay . . . . income tax as required.\u201d The record established the disqualifying \nconditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n\n \n8 \n \n \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nSome of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by \nthe facts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare ongoing and recent because he is still paying his state back taxes. However, his \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur and they do not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems could be attributed to, or were aggravated by, his \ncancer illness and his lack of knowledge concerning penalties for early withdrawal of \n401k monies. He has filed all his income tax returns, paid any federal tax owed, and has \na payment arrangement with the state. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged he made a mistake by not timely filing his tax returns \nand believing it was not important to file if all taxes owed had been paid. He now \nunderstands that he should have been more diligent filing and paying his taxes. \nApplicant established that when he became aware of the security concerns raised by \nhis failure to file and pay his taxes, he quickly made arrangements with a tax preparer to \nhelp him resolve his tax problems.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to timely file and pay his taxes are not ideal, but he made an \neffort to resolve his tax problems. He also is paying his tax debt to his state via monthly \npayments. I note that Applicant has timely filed and paid all his taxes for tax years 2016 \nand 2017. He owes no taxes for those years. His actions show diligence and \nresponsibility in the handling of his tax obligations. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, and including his recent actions, Applicant \nhas been financially responsible under the circumstances. His financial situation is \nimproving and there are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved \nand under control.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities;1 and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nRegarding the allegations that Applicant failed twice to adhere to court-ordered \nalcohol abstinence in 2015 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b), I find that the evidence is insufficient \nto establish the Interlock device violation (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted that during his \ncounseling period, he took a urinalysis screening for alcohol and failed once. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a) The charge for violating the terms of his probation was dismissed by the court after \nApplicant\u2019s compliance with the other terms of his sentence.  \n \nConsidering that there are no alcohol consumption concerns alleged, that the \ncourt dismissed the 2015 court-order violation after Applicant successfully completed \nhis sentence terms, that Applicant admitted his conduct, and the passage of time since \n2015, I find this allegation to be of no security significance, even when considered \nagainst all of the evidence as a whole. \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.c, I find that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose that he failed to \nfile his federal income tax return for tax year 2011, and a state income tax return for tax \nyear 2013, was not deliberate or made with the intent to deceive. Applicant\u2019s \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nexplanation, that he was only asked to update the SCA with information regarding his \n2014 DUI, is plausible. Of course, Applicant should have realized that every time he \ncompletes an SCA he has a legal obligation to ensure that its contents are accurate. \nBecause I find that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the information requested was not \ndeliberate, none of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are applicable to that \nconduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nfederal contractors since the early 1990s while holding a clearance. The record \nevidence is sufficient to establish that his financial problems are being resolved and are \nunder control. Applicant is fully aware of the security concerns raised by his failure to \ntimely file and pay his taxes. He promised to maintain financial responsibility to ensure \nthat he continues to be eligible for a clearance. I find that Applicant\u2019s omission on his \n2015 SCA was not deliberate or made with the intent to deceive. The financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

However, \nhis information was not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s adverse information about his personal conduct and his criminal conduct. \nHis request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn December 2, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n  \n \nOn August 22, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for personal conduct \n(Guideline E), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and financial considerations (Guideline F). \nThe current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence \non December 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on March 11, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on April 17, \n2019. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 11. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibit (AX) A. After the \nhearing, Applicant timely submitted a credit report, dated April 16, 2019 (AX B); proof of \na current automobile insurance policy (AX C); a copy of his cellphone bill for March 8, \n2019, through April 7, 2019 (AX D); and information regarding a U.S. Department of \nTreasury wage garnishment (AX E). All exhibits were admitted without objection, and the \nrecord closed on April 19, 2019. DOHA received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May \n6, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that in July 2015 (SOR 1.a), \nSeptember 2013 (SOR 1.c), July 2013 (SOR 1.d), and September 2012 (SOR 1.g), \nApplicant was charged with criminal domestic violence. It also was alleged that in April \n2004, Applicant was charged with sexual contact with a minor (SOR 1.k). Under Guideline \nJ, these allegations were cross-alleged as criminal conduct (SOR 2.a). \n \n \nAlso under Guideline E, the Government alleged that in April 2015, Applicant was \ninvoluntarily terminated from his employment with a defense contractor (SOR 1.b) for \nreasons of performance, attendance, and timekeeping as specified in SOR 1.b(i) \u2013 1.b(iv). \nIt was also alleged that in February 2013, Applicant was involuntarily terminated from a \ndifferent defense contractor for timekeeping violations (SOR 1.e), and that in November \n2012, he had submitted a falsified resume as part of his application for employment with \nthe SOR 1.e contractor (SOR 1.f). The Government further alleged that Applicant was \ninvoluntarily terminated from jobs in 2008 (SOR 1.h), 2007 (SOR 1.i), and 2006 (SOR \n1.j); and that Applicant has been evicted from at least three different residences (SOR 1.l) \n \n \nFinally, under Guideline E, it was alleged that Applicant intentionally made false \nofficial statements to the Government in his December 2015 e-QIP by claiming that he \nleft the defense contractor job referenced in SOR 1.e and 1.f by mutual agreement (SOR \n1.m); and by repeating that statement to Government investigators during subject \ninterviews in February 2016 (SOR 1.n) and July 2016 (SOR 1.o). \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $8,451 for 15 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 3.a \u2013 3.o).  \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, all of the \nallegations therein. (Answer; Tr. 12 \u2013 14) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He earned his general education diploma in May 2004. \nHe matriculated at a college-level technical school in January 2005 and earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree in computer information systems in August 2014. Applicant first \nreceived a security clearance in 2010. He started working in information technology (IT) \npositions starting in December 2012, and he has worked for his current employer since \nMay 2016. Appellant worked as a defense contractor in Afghanistan and Kuwait for a few \nmonths in 2012 and 2015, respectively. (GX 1; GX 6) \n \n \nApplicant was married from July 2007 until divorcing in November 2015. He has \none child from that marriage, which he has described as \u201chorrible.\u201d Applicant also had two \nchildren with a former girlfriend in 2003 and 2004. He also has a 13-year-old child and a \nthree-year-old child with two other former girlfriends. (GX 1; GX 6; Tr. 42, 76 \u2013 79) \n \n \nApplicant fathered his two oldest children when he was 16 and 17 years old, and \ntheir mother was 13 and 14 years old. The children\u2019s maternal grandmother was aware \nof, and consented to, Applicant\u2019s relationship with her daughter. After the older child was \nborn, the grandmother applied for food stamps for her daughter and grandchild. When \nshe again applied for food stamps after the younger grandchild was born, state family \nservices threatened to charge her with neglect of her daughter if the grandmother did not \nfile charges of illegal sexual contact with a minor against Applicant. Under state law where \nthose events occurred, the mother of Applicant\u2019s children was legally incapable, at age \n13 and 14, of consenting to sexual intercourse with Applicant. The grandmother \nsubsequently swore out a warrant against Applicant, who was released on his own \nrecognizance after turning himself in. The charges were later entered as nolle prosequi \nbecause no paternity test was ever conducted and no other physical evidence was \ngathered. Applicant admits the children are his and he is trying to support them. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; GX 7; Tr. 51 \u2013 53) \n \n \nBetween September 2012 and July 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ncriminal domestic violence stemming from arguments that became physical altercations \nwith his ex-wife (SOR 1.a and 1.e) and with two ex-girlfriends (SOR 1.c and 1.d). In each \ncase, the charges were dismissed because the victims did not appear in court as \nwitnesses against Applicant. In each case, Applicant struck or shoved the victims, one of \nwhom was pregnant at the time of the assault. Applicant claims that he is unlikely to \nengage in such conduct in the future because he has received counseling as recently as \nApril 2018, and because he no longer has contact with his ex-wife or his ex-girlfriends. \nHowever, Applicant interacts with each of them when required regarding matters of child \nsupport and visitation. He attributed his 2012 conduct to trouble adjusting after being in \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nAfghanistan for a few months, speculating that he was suffering from post-traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD). Applicant was never clinically diagnosed with PTSD and he did \nnot provide any documentation about the counseling he has received. (Answer; GX 1; GX \n6; GX 8; Tr. 42 \u2013 46, 57 \u2013 76, 121 \u2013 124) \n \n \nApplicant also has experienced financial problems over the past 15 years. \nBetween July 2007 and November 2009, he and his ex-wife were evicted from three \ndifferent residences for failing to pay rent as required. When they divorced in 2015, \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage was foreclosed because his ex-wife, who retained the property \nthrough their divorce agreement, failed to make the required monthly payments. Applicant \nrecently was able to obtain a mortgage modification and recover the house. As of \nDecember 2017, Applicant owed the debts alleged in SOR 3.a \u2013 3.o. Most of those debts \nresulted from his marriage; however, he also incurred delinquent debts because he has \nbroken at least two leases since his divorce. The debts at SOR 3.a and 3.j are two such \ndebts and they remain unresolved. Applicant successfully disputed several of the debts \nalleged in the SOR as being his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. Further, Applicant claims his \ncurrent finances are sound. He cites his increased annual salary of $98,000 and his efforts \nto clean up his credit history with the help of a credit repair firm, and his payment of \nmedical debts through an employer-sponsored health savings account as evidence of \nmitigation of the financial security concerns raised in the SOR. A credit report dated April \n16, 2019, shows only three delinquent accounts. Two of the debts listed (SOR 1.h and \n1.i) were paid off in March 2019. He also is in good standing with the creditors listed in \nSOR 1.b and 1.c, and has repaid the debt alleged at SOR 1.m. Another debt for a $3,237 \ndelinquent cellphone account, not alleged in the SOR, is being disputed by Applicant. He \nclaims it was opened by his ex-wife. It is still pending resolution. Available information \ntends to support his claimed disputes of debts from his marriage, and that he already was \ntrying to resolve his debts when the SOR was issued. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; GX 6; AX A \u2013 \nE; Tr. 54 \u2013 56, 94 \u2013 114) \n \n \nBetween April 2014 and April 2015, Applicant was employed by Company A, a \ndefense contractor who sponsored his request to renew his eligibility for a security \nclearance. Applicant left that job under adverse circumstances, but the ensuing \nbackground investigation continued because Applicant found work with another defense \ncontractor. While working at Company A, Applicant was repeatedly counseled about his \npoor performance, time-keeping and attendance discrepancies, and various violations of \ncompany policies. Despite being placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP), \nApplicant was either unable or unwilling to comply with company rules. SOR 1.b alleged \nthat Applicant was terminated from that job in April 2015. Available information shows \nthat he left that job voluntarily when it became apparent he would be fired. Applicant went \non to work for three other companies, including his current employer, without apparent \nincident. Applicant\u2019s current supervisor provided a positive recommendation based on \nApplicant\u2019s performance over most of the past three years. (Answer; GX 1; GX 6; GX 9; \nAX A; Tr. 38 \u2013 39, 44 \u2013 45, 90 \u2013 94) \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nBetween October 2006 and April 2008, Applicant was fired from three different \njobs. None of those terminations were due to reduction-in-force layoffs or other factors \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control. Each termination was due to poor job performance or violation \nof employer policies, or a combination of the two. In November 2012, Applicant applied \nfor a position with Company B, another defense contractor. In his application and an \naccompanying resume, he stated that he had an IT-related associate\u2019s degree, with a 3.0 \ngrade point average (GPA). He also stated that the first of the aforementioned involuntary \nterminations in October 2006 occurred because the warehouse where he worked had \nbeen closed. Both statements on his November 2012 job application were false, but it \nwas only after he was confronted on cross-examination with the Government\u2019s \ninformation that he admitted submitting false information in his job application. As to his \nassociate\u2019s degree, Applicant did not receive his degree until August 2014. At the time he \napplied to work at Company B, he was on academic probation with a 1.92 GPA. One of \nthe reasons for being placed on probation was a well-documented instance of plagiarism. \nApplicant\u2019s tenure with Company B was marked by unsatisfactory performance, security \nviolations, and timekeeping and attendance problems. Applicant was counseled verbally \nand in writing on multiple occasions. As alleged in SOR 1.f, he was fired by Company B \non February 2, 2013. (GX 10; GX 11; Tr. 50 \u2013 51, 79 \u2013 90) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his December 2015 e-QIP, he stated he left Company \nB by mutual agreement because Company B\u2019s government customer decided to no \nlonger fund Applicant\u2019s position. During a subject interview with a government investigator \non February 24, 2016, Applicant again stated that he left Company B by mutual \nagreement because of lack of funding. Applicant was re-interviewed on July 25, 2016. In \nthat interview, he again stated that he left Company B by mutual agreement because of \nlack of funding, before being confronted with his Company B employment records. Those \nrecords contained detailed documentation of management\u2019s actions in response to \nApplicant\u2019s poor performance and other on-the-job issues, including disregard for security \nprocedures. When Applicant testified about his termination from Company B, he again \nstated that he left by mutual agreement because of funding issues. His uncorroborated \ntestimony about the alleged security violation also directly contradicted the \ncontemporaneous records produced by the Government. Records generated by \nCompany B management and human resources personnel at the time of Applicant\u2019s \nemployment there make no mention of a lack of funding, and they do not indicate that the \nend of Applicant\u2019s employment was a mutually agreed upon event. Applicant was fired \nfrom Company B for specific, well-documented reasons. Further, in his Answer, Applicant \naverred Company B did not have any paperwork signed by him regarding his dismissal, \nyet the Government\u2019s information contains several items, such as counseling records and \nthe actual termination paperwork, signed by Applicant between December 2012 and \nFebruary 2013. As alleged in SOR 1.m \u2013 1.o, his statements about that event in his e-\nQIP and in two subject interviews constituted intentional false official statements to an \nagency of the United States. I also find that his written response and his testimony about \nthe SOR 1.m \u2013 1.o allegations are intentional false official statements. I did not find \ncredible his testimony about his academic problems and much of his employment history. \n(Answer; GX 1; GX 6; GX 10; Tr. 117 \u2013 120) \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred delinquent or past-due debts \ntotaling $8,451. As of the close of the adjudication of the information obtained in his \nbackground investigation, much of that debt remained unresolved. That information \nreasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \n\u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nAs to mitigation, Applicant established that most of his debts arose from his failed \nmarriage. He also showed that before the SOR was issued, he had taken steps to contest \nthe validity of debts his wife opened in his name and to pay his medical debts. Only two \ndebts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved; however, available information about \nApplicant\u2019s finances supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant is meeting all of his current financial obligations, has not incurred new \ndelinquencies in the past two years, and is unlikely to experience such problems in the \nfuture. On balance, available information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns \nunder this guideline. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant was charged with felony sexual contact with a minor in 2004 after he \nfathered two children with a girl who was 14 years old or younger. Although he has \nacknowledged his misconduct, the charge was not prosecuted because of lack of \nevidence. Between 2012 and 2015, Applicant was charged on four occasions with \ncriminal domestic violence after two physical altercations with his ex-wife and two \naltercations with ex-girlfriends. None of those charges were prosecuted, but this record, \nincluding Applicant\u2019s testimony, establishes that there were no misunderstandings or \nfalse complaints by the victims. Applicant physically assaulted each of the women \ninvolved. This information reasonably raises a security concern about criminal conduct \nthat is expressed at AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nMore specifically, the record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 31 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant last engaged in criminal conduct almost four years ago. He claimed he \nis unlikely to repeat his conduct because he has matured and he no longer has contact \nwith any of the women he assaulted; however, he was 30 years old at the time of his most \nrecent arrest, and he still interacts with his ex-wife and at least one ex-girlfriend regarding \nmatters related to their children. He also claimed he has received counseling about his \nconduct, but he did not provide any information about that counseling or its results. For \nthese reasons, and because of unmitigated security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal \nconduct (discussed under Guideline E, below), I conclude none of the AG \u00b6 31 mitigating \nconditions apply. The security concerns under this guideline are not mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s information established that Applicant has a long history of \nunacceptable conduct that directly undermines confidence in his judgment and his \ntrustworthiness. The information about his employment history, his criminal conduct, and \nhis multiple false official statements raises a security concern about personal conduct \nstates at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nMore specifically, the record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 16 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . .  \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \n \nI also considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \n \nI conclude that the record does not support application of any of the mitigating \nconditions. Applicant has not made any prompt, good-faith effort to correct his earlier false \nofficial statements. To the contrary, in response to the SOR and at hearing, he repeated \nhis false claims about the reason for his dismissal from Company B. He did not establish \nthat his false answers to e-QIP questions were the product of advice from an authorized \nsource. Applicant\u2019s information did not establish that he has been rehabilitated with \nrespect to his criminal conduct. Although more than four years has passed since his last \narrest, his continued willingness to make false statements, and the lack of information \nabout his counseling sustain doubts about his judgment. \n \n \nAn ongoing security concern is Applicant\u2019s long record of poor job performance, \nincluding repeated violations of rules and regulations. Although he recently has \nexperienced more employment stability and has the support of his current supervisor, the \nlength of Applicant\u2019s adverse employment record, and his repeated willingness to make \nfalse statements about this part of his background, preclude a conclusion that such events \nwill not recur. The security concerns under this guideline are not mitigated. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Of note is the positive information about Applicant\u2019s recent job performance \nand reputation in the workplace. Nonetheless, this record presents a compendium of \nadverse information over the past 15 years that requires more substantial mitigating \ninformation to overcome the doubts raised by his personal conduct and criminal conduct. \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \nBecause protection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, \nany remaining doubts must be resolved against the granting of access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 2.a: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.o: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 3.) On May 23, 2017, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) \nand G (Alcohol Consumption). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 1, 2017, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2.) A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) prepared by Department Counsel, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nconsisting of Items 1 to 5, was provided to Applicant on September 6, 2017. Applicant \nreceived received the file on September 21, 2017.1 \n \n \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit additional \ninformation. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2018. Based upon a review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nThe SOR in this case was issued under the adjudicative guidelines that came \ninto effect within the DoD on September 1, 2006. Security Executive Agent Directive \n(SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), implements \nnew adjudicative guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. All national security eligibility \ndecisions2 issued on or after June 8, 2017, are to be decided using the new National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), as implemented in Appendix \nA of SEAD 4. I considered the previous adjudicative guidelines, as well as the new AG, \nin adjudicating Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. My decision would be the same \nunder either set of guidelines, although this decision is issued pursuant to the new AG \npromulgated in SEAD 4. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 58 and single. He has an associate\u2019s degree and has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since 1982 as a production planner. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since approximately 1984 and seeks to retain national security \neligibility for access to classified information in connection with his employment. (Item 3 \nat Sections 12, 13A, and 25.) \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n1 Department Counsel submitted five Items in support of the SOR allegations. Item 4 is inadmissible. It is \nthe summary of an unsworn interview of Applicant conducted by an interviewer from the Office of \nPersonnel Management on March 25, 2016. Applicant did not adopt the summary as his own statement, \nor otherwise certify it to be accurate. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation (ROI) \nsummary is inadmissible in the Government\u2019s case in chief in the absence of an authenticating witness. \n(See Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 5.) In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 4 is also cumulative. Applicant \nis not legally trained and might not have understood Department Counsel\u2019s FORM footnote 2, which \ndescribed the potential admissibility of Item 4. I therefor reviewed it for any potentially mitigating \ninformation that Applicant might have thought would be considered. Any such mitigating information will \nbe discussed later in this decision. \n2 SEAD 4 \u00b6 D.7 defines \u201cNational Security Eligibility\u201d as, \u201cEligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, to include access to sensitive compartmented information, restricted \ndata, and controlled or special access program information.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct) \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility because he has a history of criminal conduct. Applicant admitted all \nthree allegations under this paragraph. \n \n \n1.a. Applicant was arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) in April 2011. \nApplicant pled guilty and was sentenced to two years of probation, and 12 months and 5 \ndays in jail, with 11 months and 25 days suspended. Appellant stated that he spent two \nweekends at the city jail farm. (Item 3 at Section 22.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant was arrested a second time for DWI on December 18, 2015. This \nwas about a week after signing his e-QIP (Item 3), in which he discussed his first DWI \narrest. He pled guilty on April 19, 2016, and was sentenced to spend ten days in jail, \nthree years of probation, suspension of his driver\u2019s license for three years, and he was \nrequired to take and complete an Outpatient Substance Abuse Program. His probation \nwill end in approximately April 2019. (Item 5.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he drank alcohol on July 22, 2016, while taking a 26-\nweek substance abuse program. His alcohol use was discovered because Applicant \nwas tested by the program. His treatment program was extended from 26 weeks to 36 \nweeks. Applicant stated in his response to DoD CAF interrogatories that he completed \nthe program on March 23, 2017. Applicant has been diagnosed with Moderate Alcohol \nUse Disorder. He further stated that he goes to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) one to two \ntimes a week. Applicant submitted no documentary information from the counseling \nprogram to support his statement that he had successfully completed it. (Item 5.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility because he abuses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted the sole \nallegation under this paragraph, which states that the conduct set forth under Paragraph \n1, above, is cognizable under this paragraph as well. \n \n \nApplicant stated in his response to interrogatories that he stopped drinking \nalcohol on July 22, 2016. He further stated that he stopped using alcohol because he \nhad received a second DWI, and his personal health. Applicant also stated that he had \nno intention of using alcohol in the future. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information.  \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions apply: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant had alcohol-related arrests and convictions for Driving While \nIntoxicated in 2011 and 2015. He is currently on probation for the 2015 arrest until April \n2019. All three of these disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense;  and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, as described in the Findings of Fact, was serious, recent, \nand criminal. He is on probation until April 2019. He has introduced insufficient evidence \nto support a finding that he has mitigated his misconduct under this guideline. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying. Six conditions possibly apply to the facts in \nthis case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed;  \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nApplicant has a history of drinking to excess, as shown by the two alcohol-related \nincidents set forth in the SOR and discussed above. The last incident was in December \n2015. He entered treatment in 2016, and the treatment was extended from twenty-six \nweeks to thirty-six weeks because he drank while in the program, which violated \nprogram rules and the pertinent court order.   \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns.  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions were established in this case. Applicant had \ntwo alcohol-related arrests for Driving While Intoxicated, the last in December 2015. He \nstates he successfully completed his outpatient treatment, but did not provide any \nsupporting documentation. He states that he has been abstinent from alcohol since July \n2016, but once again we have no evidence to support Applicant\u2019s statement. Applicant \nappears to have difficulty accepting or admitting he has a problem with alcohol. \nConsidering all the available evidence, I find that not enough time has passed without \nan incident to be confident that he will not resume drinking and acting irresponsibly \nwhile under the influence. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility and a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as to Applicant=s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. In sufficient time has passed since his \nsecond DWI conviction to demonstrate rehabilitation, and the likelihood or recurrence \nremains significant. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the guidelines for Criminal Conduct and Alcohol \nConsumption. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n            \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n            \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9\nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

A Chinese citizen by birth and a U.S. citizen since \n2000, Applicant met her burden to present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern for foreign influence based on her family ties \nto China. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on February 25, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as \na security clearance application. After a background investigation, on July 14, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline B for foreign influence due to her \nfamily ties to China, the country of her birth.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2017. She admitted the SOR \nallegations with explanations. She also requested an in-person hearing before an \nadministrative judge.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on December 13, 2017. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on April 18, 2018. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Government Exhibits 1-4 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A-G. I took administrative or official notice, which is similar to judicial notice, of \ncertain facts concerning the country of China per Department Counsel\u2019s written \nrequest.2 The essential facts about China are discussed below. The hearing transcript \nwas received on May 3, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, a native of China, is a 56-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a \nsecurity clearance at the secret level, which was granted to her in 2006,3 for her job as \na software quality engineer. She has worked for the same aerospace company since \n2004. Before that, she worked as a software engineer for a large U.S. company. She \nhas a good employment record based on a highly favorable letter of recommendation \nfrom a technical fellow who serves as the technical lead for a team of 200 engineers.4 \nAmong other things, the letter described Applicant as a sought after software engineer \n\u201cdue to her dedication, attention to detail, and hard work.\u201d The letter also described \nApplicant as \u201ca dedicated American citizen who enjoys being active in the community \nand just wants the best for her [children].\u201d  \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a Chinese university of science and \ntechnology in 1983. She was then employed as a software and hardware engineer. She \nlived with her parents until her marriage to a citizen of China in 1987. Applicant has \nlived in the United States since 1990, when she and her then husband came here via \nher husband\u2019s student visa so he could pursue further education. In due course, she \nbecame a permanent resident of the United States, and she obtained U.S. citizenship in \n2000. Her marriage ended in divorce in 2004. She had two children during the marriage, \nboth of whom are native-born U.S. citizens. Her 23-year-old daughter is a recent college \ngraduate who has plans to attend medical school. Her 19-year-old son is a college \nstudent who studies computer science.  \n \n \n                                                          \n2 Exhibit 4.  \n \n3 Exhibit 1; Tr. 6-7.  \n \n4 Exhibit B.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe SOR concerns Applicant\u2019s family ties to China via her father, mother, and \ntwo sisters. These are the same family members as when Applicant was granted a \nsecurity clearance in 2006. The relevant details are set forth below. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father, now both in their 80s, came to the United States in \n2002 via Applicant\u2019s sponsorship. They were granted permanent resident status in \nNovember 2002.5 They lived with Applicant when they were not visiting their other \ndaughter in the United States. Neither speaks English, and neither was employed in the \nUnited States. It was not unusual for her parents to travel back and forth between the \nUnited States and China. They returned to China in 2012 or 2013 due to her father\u2019s \ndeclining health.6 Applicant\u2019s father has been retired for more than 20 years from his job \nas a manager for the same company she worked for in China.7 Likewise, Applicant\u2019s \nmother has been retired for more than 20 years from her job as a department-store \nmanager.8 Applicant speaks to her parents by telephone weekly. Applicant\u2019s parents are \naware that she works as a software engineer for an aerospace company, but that is the \nextent of their knowledge.9 \n \nIn addition to her parents, Applicant has two sisters who are both citizens of \nChina. One sister lives in the United States and has been a permanent resident since \n2011.10 Her sister has a job working in a college library. Her sister\u2019s husband is \nemployed as a professor at the same college. Another sister lives in China, and she is \nemployed as a civil engineer for a Chinese engineering firm.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests are here with the exception of a bank account in \nChina. In addition to her annual salary, Applicant has the following financial assets in \nthe United States: (1) her home with a market value of about $400,000 with a mortgage \nloan balance of about $100,000; (2) a 401(k) account with a balance of about $700,000 \nto $800,000; (3) two residential rental properties which are unencumbered by mortgage \nloans; (4) approximately $250,000 in IRA accounts; and (5) $75,000 to $100,000 in \nbank accounts.11 She opened a bank account in China sometime after her parents \nreturn in the event she wanted to provide financial assistance to them.12 She made an \ninitial deposit of about $25,000 to $30,000, and has since made no further deposits. The \n                                                          \n5 Exhibits D and E.  \n \n6 Tr. 51.  \n \n7 Tr. 47.  \n \n8 Tr. 48.  \n \n9 Tr. 53-54.  \n \n10 Exhibit F.  \n \n11 Tr. 62-69.  \n \n12 Tr. 57-59.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \naccount is in her name, but her parents have a debit or ATM card to access the account \nif necessary.  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been accused of or cited for a security \ninfraction or security violation since granted eligibility in 2006. Likewise, there is no \nevidence that she has otherwise mishandled sensitive or classified information or failed \nto perform security-related duties or responsibilities. At the hearing, she expressed a \ngood understanding of security-related matters.13  \n \nConcerning the country of China, Department Counsel\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice contains an extensive discussion of the security concerns \nassociated with China. The most pertinent of those facts are the following: (1) China is \nan authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority; \n(2) China (along with Russia) is the most aggressive collector of intelligence (both \nindustrial and military) related to U.S. information and technology; and (3) China has a \npoor record of human rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person, respect for \ncivil liberties, respect for political rights, corruption and lack of transparency in \ngovernment, worker rights, as well as discrimination, societal abuses, and human \ntrafficking. The maltreatment and oppression of the people in Tibet is but one example \nof China\u2019s poor human-rights record.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.14 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.15 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d16 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.17 The Appeal Board has \n                                                          \n13 Tr. 56-57.  \n \n14 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n15 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n16 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n17 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n5 \n \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.18 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.19 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.20 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.21 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.22 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.23 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.24 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s ties to China should disqualify her from access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,25 the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern \nunder the guideline is: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n                                                          \n18 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n19 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n20 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n21 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n22 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n23 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n24 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n25 AG \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, and 8 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.26 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.  \n \n \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of China. Suffice it to say, the \nU.S. Government views the behavior of the Chinese government as presenting a \nserious national security concern, and the heightened-risk element is satisfied too. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s family ties to China, the Government has established its case under \nGuideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \n                                                          \n26 AG \u00b6 6.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.  \n \n \nChina\u2019s relationship with the United States and the heightened risk it presents \nplace a heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, \nApplicant has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy \nperson. She was serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. She appears to have \ncooperated fully and provided truthful information about her family ties to China during \nthe security clearance process. She made a good impression upon me during the \nhearing.  \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China. Applicant came to the \nUnited States more than 25 years ago in 1990, and she has since established and \nmade her life here. She has a long employment record in the United States, she gave \nbirth to two children in the United States, and her adult children are pursing their lives \nand educations in the United States. In addition to her children, she has a sister who \nlives and works in the United States as well as a brother-in-law. Her parents resided in \nthe United States for about a decade until returning to China for health reasons in about \n2012 or 2013. Her financial assets, which are substantial, are in the United States \nexcept for a bank account in China she established to assist her parents. The value and \nroutine nature of her Chinese bank account is such that it is unlikely to pose a conflict, \nand it is unlikely to be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. AG \u00b6 8(f) is \napplicable. \n \n \nOther than her parents return to China, little has changed since Applicant was \nfavorably adjudicated for a security clearance in 2006. Applicant has since had more \ntime to establish her ties and connections to the United States, and to demonstrate that \nshe adheres to security rules and requirements for her employment with a defense \ncontractor. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Chinese government or her family members who \nhave Chinese citizenship. I further conclude there is no conflict of interest, because \nApplicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States that she can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in the \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that she met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on March 11, 2016. \nOn June 19, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines G and J. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR, with attached evidentiary exhibits \nreferenced herein collectively as \u201cAnswer,\u201d on August 1, 2017, and requested a hearing \n12/26/2018\n\n \n2\nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November \n1, 2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 5, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on June 13, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant consumed alcohol to the point \nof intoxication from about 1991/1992 to at least January 2016, and that this excessive \nconsumption resulted in five arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), two \nof which resulted in 12 months\u2019 probation, and that Applicant received alcohol-related \ntreatment for a condition diagnosed as alcohol-use disorder. Applicant denies the \ncharacterization of his alcohol consumption. He admits the DUI arrests, but denies that \nhe was intoxicated during the incidents. Applicant also denies that he was sentenced to \nprobation as a result of his December 2015 DUI arrest. However, he admits that he was \nsentenced to 12 months\u2019 probation following his February 2016 DUI arrest. He admits \nthat he successfully underwent alcohol-related treatment. The SOR cross-alleges under \nGuideline J, the alcohol-related arrests. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old avionics supervisor employed by a defense contractor \nsince May 2014, and previously employed by another defense contractor beginning in \nDecember 2009. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 1989 until he \nretired in August 2010. He deployed to a combat zone during Operation Desert Storm. \nHe has held a security clearance since approximately 1990. Applicant has a teenage \ndaughter. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26.)  \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol in 1991 while assigned to an aircraft carrier, but \ndid drink not to the point of intoxication or have any alcohol-related issues during the \n1990s. In February 2006, Applicant had been drinking and was pulled over for speeding. \n(Tr. 40.) At the stop, Applicant refused to perform field sobriety tests or take a breathalyzer \nat the officer\u2019s direction, but instead requested a blood test. He was arrested for DUI, \nspeeding, no insurance, and no seatbelt. The DUI charge was reduced to reckless driving \nand ultimately dismissed.  \n \nIn December 2010, Applicant was pulled over for speeding. The officer asked \nApplicant if he had been drinking, Applicant denied that he had been, and refused a \nbreathalyzer. He was arrested and charged with DUI and speeding. Ultimately, the DUI \ncharge was dismissed, the related court costs were waived, and Applicant paid a fine for \nspeeding.  \n \nIn January 2015, Applicant was pulled over on an Army base for speeding. The \nofficer stated in his report that Applicant smelled strongly of alcohol. However, Applicant \n\n \n3\nhas consistently stated that he had not been drinking. (Answer; Tr. 31; Tr. 41; Tr. 46.) \nApplicant refused a breathalyzer, and was arrested for DUI and speeding. He was \ndetained for approximately 14 hours, then released. The DUI charge was later dismissed \nand Applicant paid a $10 fine for speeding. (GX 5; Answer.) Applicant testified that he \nhad several run-ins with arresting officer of the incident on the Army base. He reported \nthe officer\u2019s conduct to the commanding officer, but ultimately Applicant decided to move \noff base to avoid future issues. Applicant believes that the officer was confusing Applicant \nwith someone else. (Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant was pulled over for speeding while on the way to the \nhospital to visit his girlfriend. After the stop, the officer stated that he had seen Applicant \nthrow drugs from the vehicle. Applicant denied this and demanded to see the footage \nfrom the officer\u2019s dashboard mounted camera. The officer refused. Applicant was arrested \nand charged with DUI, speeding, illegal lane change, no insurance, and no registration. \nApplicant denies that he consumed any alcohol prior to the arrest. At Applicant\u2019s fourth \ncourt appearance, the officer was not present and Applicant\u2019s attorney stated that all \ncharges would be suspended and later dismissed if Applicant pled guilty and completed \na pre-trial diversion program and paid a $3,600 fine. Applicant did not enter the \nagreement, but instead, requested a jury trial. At the pretrial conference, all charges \nexcept for the speeding were dismissed. (Answer.) \n \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant was in a rental car in a friend\u2019s driveway. He had been \ndrinking the night before and there was an empty cup in the car which had contained a \nnon-alcoholic daiquiri. His friend noticed the vehicle, which she did not recognize, and \ncalled the police. The police arrived, and after speaking with Applicant and noting the \napparent open container, asked Applicant to take a breathalyzer. Applicant refused and \nwas arrested for DUI. Applicant pled no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to \n12 months\u2019 probation, which required Applicant to abstain from alcohol use, attend alcohol \nawareness classes with random urinalysis, and complete 50 hours of community service. \nApplicant successfully completed the requirements and was released from probation in \nJune 2017. (Answer.) \n \n \n \nThree days after his last DUI arrest in February 2016, Applicant self-referred to the \nArmy Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). He was evaluated by a counselor who stated \nthat Applicant met the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (Moderate). He was assessed as \nnot needing medical detoxification or inpatient treatment. Applicant entered outpatient \ntreatment and counseling and \u201cmet his treatment goal of establishing and maintaining \nabstinence while increasing his knowledge about the disease of addiction in the process \nof recovery.\u201d He successfully completed the treatment requirements which included \nattending Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings, and, in May 2016, received a fair to good \nprognosis. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol consumption since February 2016, four \nmonths before beginning probation. Despite his denials that he had been drinking prior to \nseveral of his DUI arrests, Applicant admits that he had been drinking before the 2006 \nand 2016 arrests, and that consuming alcohol has created problems in his life. (Tr. 40-\n\n \n4\n43; Answer.) Applicant has no other criminal history. He strives to continually set an \nexample for his teenage daughter through his actions. (Tr. 23-24; 39.) He is active in his \nchurch, and coaches Little League basketball and football. (Tr. 36.) He is working towards \nhis bachelor\u2019s degree, regularly works out at a gym, and continues to attend AA meetings \ntwo to three times a week. (Tr. 37-38; AX A.) He has no intention of drinking alcohol in \nthe future. (Tr. 38.)  \n \nApplicant accepts full responsibility for his actions. He is dedicated to his job. \nApplicant\u2019s two fellow service members and friends since 1991, and a current coworker \nsince 2011 attest to Applicant\u2019s strength of character, integrity, and trustworthiness, and \nhighly recommend him for a continued security clearance. (AX A.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5\n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6\nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n \nApplicant began drinking in 1991, but did not have any alcohol-related issues until \nhis first DUI arrest in 2006. Between 2006 and 2016, Applicant was arrested five times \nfor DUI, and admits that he had been drinking on two of those occasions. Immediately \nfollowing his last DUI arrest in February 2016, Applicant quit drinking and self-referred to \nASAP, which he successfully completed with a fair to good prognosis in May 2016. He \nrecognizes that his alcohol use was problematic. He remains abstinent, attends AA \nmeetings two to three times a week, and does not intend to drink in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23(b) and 23(d) apply. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n\n \n7\nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DUI arrests occurred during a period of time when he was actively using \nalcohol. He has not had any arrests or charges since achieving sobriety in February 2016. \nHe self-referred to ASAP, successfully completed probation, and continues to voluntarily \nparticipate in AA. He is dedicated to his job, and is pursuing his bachelor\u2019s degree. He \ncontinually strives to be a role model for his daughter, and is active in his church and \ncommunity His past conduct does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant served in the Navy for over 21 years, including a combat deployment. \nHe has held a security clearance for more than 27 years. Applicant has taken positive \nsteps, including cessation of alcohol use since February 2016. He has sought ongoing \nsupport for his sobriety by attending AA. He has clearly demonstrated his commitment to \nreform and rehabilitation. He is respected and trusted by his long-time friends and \ncoworkers. He is pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree. He accepts responsibility of his past \nconduct, and is committed to his sobriety, his family, and his job.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for continued access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

(Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 30, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant to Executive \nOrder (Exec.

I did not receive a response to my January 27, 2019 email.    \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant paid a credit card debt for $5,272. (AE A) On \nDecember 12, 2018, she sent $5,000 to the IRS to ensure the IRS had ample funds to \naddress any income tax she owed. (AE L) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n                                            \n4 An Applicant\u2019s failure to provide requested, available tax documentation, including IRS-generated \nfederal income tax transcripts, can undermine mitigation of tax debts. See ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018). \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns as required . . . .\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i allege and \ncredit reports establish eight delinquent medical debts totaling $2,198, and she had a \nfederal income tax lien entered against her for $28,188. Applicant admitted that she failed \nto timely file several state and federal tax returns. She did not provide proof that her state \ntax returns were filed as of February 20, 2019 for tax years 2015 and 2016. The \nGovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;5   \n                                            \n5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply to her failure to timely file and pay her federal \nand state income taxes; however, Applicant presented some important mitigating \ninformation about her finances. Several circumstances that were partially or fully beyond \nher control adversely affected her finances or filing of tax returns: (1) she was ill and \nunable to work for four months in 2012; (2) she was repeatedly assaulted by her husband; \n(3) her father-in-law was supposed to file her tax returns and did not do so; (4) her \nhusband did not pay his share of marital debts; (5) her husband left the United States and \nenforcement of the separation agreement was not feasible; (6) her husband did not \nprovide documentation or information to assist her in filing her tax returns; and (7) these \nmultiple factors cumulatively caused her delinquent debts or distracted her from taking \ncare of her finances, especially her federal and state income taxes for several years. \n \nApplicant acted reasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of her medical \nand dental debts. She showed numerous payments towards her family\u2019s medical or dental \ndebts. She is credited with mitigating the medical and dental financial allegations in SOR \n                                            \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in \norder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the \napplicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent \nsuch problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing \n                                            \n6 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that she did not timely file her federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 and 2017. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal \nBoard listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId.

On \nJanuary 27, 2019, I emailed Applicant and requested a copy of her 2017 federal and state income tax \nreturns; however, she may not have received my January 27, 2019 email. No adverse inference is drawn \nfrom her failure to provide her 2017 federal and state income tax returns. She received my request for her \nfederal and state tax returns for tax year 2016, and she did provide her federal tax return for tax year 2016 \n(signed on December 1, 2019). Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for \ntax year 2016 will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nirresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01031 at 3 and n. 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \napproach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d \nanalysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus \non timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file her state and federal income tax returns. \nAs of February 20, 2019, the date the record closed, she did not provide proof that she \nfiled her state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, and she has been employed by a defense contractor in \nworkforce planning since 2016. In 1996, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2001, \nshe received a master\u2019s degree in business administration. In 2001, she married, and in \n2012, she separated from her spouse. She has custody of her three children, and her \nhusband is living outside the United States.  \n \nSeveral circumstances partially or fully beyond Applicant\u2019s control adversely \naffected her finances. She acted reasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of \nher medical and dental debts, and she is credited with mitigating the financial allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i. She is also credited with paying the tax lien alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of failing to timely file her federal and state income tax returns \nraises unresolved financial considerations security concerns. She may owe state income \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \ntaxes for tax years 2015 and 2016.7 When an issue of delinquent taxes is involved, an \nadministrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax \nreturns, whether the IRS or a state generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant \nwaits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.8 The primary \nproblem here is that Applicant has repeatedly been late filing her tax returns, and she did \nnot provide proof that she filed her state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. \n  \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible \nfor a security clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \na security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. This decision should \nnot be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of \nreform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. In the future, with a track \nrecord of addressing her delinquent financial obligations and timely filing tax returns and \npaying taxes, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security \nclearance worthiness.    \n \n I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nFinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \n \n \n                                            \n7 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d). \n \n8 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s \ncontrol adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s \nwages, and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 \n(App. Bd.

More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and \ncited applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concern stemming from his delinquent state taxes, his failure to \ntimely file state and federal tax returns, and his delinquent debts. Accordingly, this case \nis decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 27, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that \nhis circumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 15, 2017, and requested a hearing to \nestablish his eligibility for continued access to classified information.1 \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.    \n03/27/2019\n\n2 \n \n \n \n \nUpon due notice to Applicant, on August 2, 2018, a hearing was convened. The \ntranscript (Tr. No. 1) of that initial hearing was received on August 10, 2018. Applicant \nappeared and explained that he had just recently completed some domestic relations \nhearings and had used his financial resources and time taking care of that matter. \nApplicant also indicated that he was considering retaining counsel or at least consulting \nwith counsel for this hearing. Without objection, I granted a continuance of about six \nweeks.2  \n \n  \nUpon due notice to Applicant, the hearing was reconvened on September 12, \n2018. Applicant testified, and the exhibits offered by the Government were admitted into \nthe record without objection. (Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 6 and Hearing Exhibits (HE) \nI and II were admitted without objection.) Applicant offered five exhibits, Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted without objection. At the request of \nApplicant, without objection, the record remained open until September 26, 2018. \nApplicant timely submitted four documents, which I marked as AE F through AE I and \nwere admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the reconvened hearing was \nreceived on September, 20, 2018.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, a college graduate with some post-graduate work, and \nhas been divorced since 2014.

Although \nhe was not supposed to spend the nights, he often did so anyway.6  \n \nIn early 2013, Applicant, his mother, and his grandmother moved to a rental house. \nThat lodging was barely adequate and ultimately developed utility problems.7 Since \nApplicant remained unemployed, he could take his mother to her dialysis three days a \nweek and help care for his paralyzed grandmother, as well. They lived there in 2013 and \n2014. Applicant\u2019s mother died in January 2015, and his grandmother died six months \nlater.8 \n \nAfter his grandmother died, Applicant moved to an efficiency appartment at a \nnearby college where he was doing part-time work. The college allowed him to live there \nrent-free. He lived there until August 2015, when he moved to a college-owned two \nbedroom apartment, again rent-free. Applicant is still living there.9 \n \nApplicant has had numerous periods of unemployment that have impaired his \nability to recover fully from his financial difficulties. His periods of unemployment were as \nfollows: November 2017 to June 2018; October 2015 to April or May 2016; August 2014 \nto December 2014; March 2014 to June 2014; May 2013 to January 2014.

Apr. 4, 2014). \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n21 Answer, pp. 6-7. That debt does not appear on the most recent credit reports (GE 4; GE 5). It was last \nreported on August 20, 2016. GE 6.  \n\n6 \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has had financial problems, which purportedly \nraise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations security concern \nis explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.22 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal [or] state . . . income tax returns  \n \nor failure to pay annual . . . state . . . income tax as required; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n                                                          \n22 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n \n\n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, my \nobligation is to examine the way an applicant handles personal financial obligations to \nassess how he may handle his security obligations.23 Here, Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility was called into question by his failure to timely file his state and Federal income \ntax returns, pay his state income tax obligation, and by his level of delinquent consumer \ndebt. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. The next \ninquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nThe record is clear that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by a parade of \nhorrible conditions, any one or more of which would severely test the financial stability of \nany individual. There is no need for a detailed recap of what is made clear in the findings \nof fact. In sum, Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and his testimony showed that his financial \nproblems were largely caused by: (1) an acrimonious divorce and custody dispute; (2) \nserious illnesses suffered by Applicant\u2019s mother (on dialysis three days a week) and his \ngrandmother (paralysis); (3) several periods of unemployment caused by conditions \nbeyond his control, and in part by the need for Applicant to care for his mother and \ngrandmother; (4) Applicant being ousted from his home by his then spouse in late 2011; \n(5) using what time and resources Applicant had on the custody battle for his two sons; \n(6) Applicant being homeless periodically. I find that the allegations in the SOR are \nmitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e), and (g).  \n \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion \n                                                          \n23 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 31, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on February \n13, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on February 15, 2018, scheduling the hearing for March 21, 2018. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. GX 5 was admitted for Administrative Notice as to \nthe Philippines. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered two documents, which I \nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and B and admitted into evidence. The record \n\n \n2 \n \nwas left open until April 23, 2018, for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant \nsubmitted nothing further. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on March \n29, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 20 line \n22 to page 21 line 13, and GX 1 at page 5.) He has been employed with the defense \ncontractor \u201csince July of 2017.\u201d (TR at page 20 line 22 to page 21 line 13.) He is married \nto a Philippine national; and has three children, the two eldest living with his former \nspouse in the United States. (TR at page 20 lines 18~21, and GX 1 at pages 46~47 and \n53.) His youngest child resides in the Philippines with the child mother, Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent wife. Applicant resides in the United States. \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant attributes his admitted financial difficulties to brief periods of \nunemployment, the one \u201cstarted May 31, 2017, to July 17, 2017.\u201d (TR at page 34 lines \n1~10.)  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt in the amount of about $7,291, \nas the result of a breach of contract with a former employer. (TR at page 21 line 21 to \npage 25 line 6.) Through a credit counseling service, Applicant is making monthly \npayments of $134 towards this admitted debt, as evidenced by documentation from that \ncounseling service. (AppX A at page1 and AppX B at page 1.) This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. and 1.f. Applicant admits that he has two past-due debts with the \nDepartment of Education totaling about $3,672. (TR at page 25 line 7 to page 27 line 2.) \nIn August and September of 2017, Applicant was trying to make monthly payments of \nonly $5 towards this admitted debt. (Id, and AppX A at page 2 and AppX B at pages \n2~3.) This documentation also shows that Applicant was \u201cpast due\u201d $5 on his payments. \n(Id.) Despite having a month to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing further in this \nregard. (TR at page 42 line 23 to page 43 line 19.) These allegations are found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.c.  Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt in the amount of about $1,747 \nto Creditor C. (TR at page 27 line 3 to page 28 line 10.) Through a credit counseling \nservice, Applicant is making monthly payments of $88 towards this admitted debt, as \nevidenced by documentation from that counseling service. (AppX A at page1 and AppX \nB at page 1.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that he had a past-due debt with Creditor D in the amount \nof about $696, but avers that this \u201cphone bill account . . . was paid off.\u201d (TR at page 28 \n\n \n3 \n \nline 11 to page 29 line 8.) Despite having a month to do so, Applicant has submitted \nnothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admits that he had past-due child support payments totaling about \n$7,747. In August of 2017, this was being paid through wage garnishment. (TR at page \n29 line 9 to page 31 line 14, and AppX at page 3 and AppX B at pages 4~5.) Despite \nhaving a month to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \nNot alleged; but admitted to by Applicant at his hearing, he is a month past due \non a car payment, and owes about $800 in state back taxes. (TR at page 32 line 3 to \npage 36 line 2.) \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \n \n2.a, 2.b., and 2.d. Applicant\u2019s current spouse is a citizen and resident of the \nPhilippines. She hopes to immigrate to the United States. Their four-year-old American \nson resides with Applicant\u2019s spouse. Applicant provides financial support of about $600 \nevery few months to his spouse. She lives with her parents. (TR at page 20 line 4~21, at \npage 37 line 18 to page 40 line 17.) \n \n \n2.c. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the \nPhilippines. (TR at page 41 line 18 to page 42 line 3.) They know little about Applicant\u2019s \nemployment, only that he is \u201ca mechanic . . . [who does] work for the Military.\u201d (Id.) \n \n \n2.e. In 2012, over five years ago, Applicant gave a one-time gift of about $500 to \na female friend in the Philippines. (TR at page 40 line 18 to page 41 line 17.) Their \nrelationship was terminated years ago. (Id.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nI take Administrative Notice of the following facts regarding the Philippines: It is a \nmultiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature. However, dynastic \npolitical families continue to monopolize elective offices. The U.S. Department of State \nadvises all U.S. citizens traveling to the Philippines to exercise caution due to crime, \nterrorism, and civil unrest. (GX 5 at pages 3~5.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n\n \n4 \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n5 \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due debt to private companies, and to Federal and \nstate agencies. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation has not been established. Financial Considerations are found against \nApplicant. \n \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and in-laws are citizens and residents of the Philippines. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s connection with his Philippine family does not outweigh his \nallegiance to the United States. His wife hopes to immigrate to the United States with \ntheir child. Foreign Influence is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant failed to timely file his \n2013, 2014, and 2015 Federal income tax returns and his 2015 state income tax return. \nThe Statement of Reasons (SOR) listed two student loan obligations of approximately \n$27,000 and three charged-off accounts totaling approximately $750. He has filed his tax \nreturns and received sizable refunds. He paid his charged-off accounts and is current on \nhis student loan obligation. He has made sufficient progress toward resolving his past-\ndue debts to continue his security clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was unable \n03/05/2019\n\n \n2 \nto find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for him.1  \n \nOn June 30, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 7, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on February 27, 2018. At the hearing, six Government exhibits (Ex. \n1-6) and eleven Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-K) were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Records submitted by Applicant as attachments to his answer were considered. \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 7, 2018. I held the \nrecord open after the hearing for Applicant to submit additional documents which were \nreceived through January 2019, and were admitted into the record as Ex. L \u2013 AG.  \n \nWhile this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective \u201cfor \nall covered individuals\u201d on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations of failing to file his \nFederal tax returns in a timely manner (SOR 1.a), failing to file his state income tax returns \nin a timely manner (SOR 1.b), and denied owing a gas utility bill (SOR 1.g), which he \nasserted he had paid. He admitted the remaining four delinquent obligation allegations. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old senior software engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since February 2015. (Tr. 39, Tr. 18) He seeks to obtain a security clearance. \n(Ex. 1) He previously held a clearance from 2005 to 2015, with a different defense \ncompany. (Tr. 19) He honorably served in the U.S. Navy from July 1994 through June \n1995. (Ex. 1, Tr. 18) He is married and has a son age 19 and twins aged 17. (Ex. 1) In \nMay 1999, he obtained a bachelor-of-science degree in computer science. (Tr. 19) \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income after taxes is $4,800 to $5,000. (Tr. 48) His wife\u2019s income \n                                                          \n1 The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, \n2006. \n \n2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in \nthis case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf. \n  \n\n \n3 \nvaries. His wife operated her own business making craft items sold at craft shows. (Tr. \n27, 48) \n \n In 2011, Applicant made a job-related relocation from Texas to Florida. (Tr. 54) In \nFebruary 2015, Applicant made another job-related relocation from Florida to his current \nstate. (Ex. 1, Ex. E, Tr.25) On June 26, 2017, he filed a 2015 part-year resident state \nincome tax return. (Ex. E, AE) He listed $61,439 state income, $2,666 of state withholding \ntax, and a refund due of $2,613. (Ex. E) \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s September 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), he indicated he had not filed his 2013 Federal income tax return \nbecause he could not locate all the documentation he needed to file the return. (Ex. 1) In \nhis August 2015 enhanced subject interview, he indicated he had not filed his 2013 or \n2014 Federal tax returns3 because he was missing documents and planned to file the \nreturns by December 2015. (Ex. 2) His tax filings were further delayed when his tax \ndocuments were boxed up when he moved in February 2015. (Ex. 5) He was in the \nprocess of filing his returns when things became misplaced during the move. (Tr. 22)  \n \nIn November 2016, Applicant contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about \nhis failure to file his 2013, 2014, and 2015 returns. (Tr. 30) He was granted an extension \nuntil December 2016 and told if he was unable to meet the deadline, he should continue \nworking to get his returns filed. (Ex. 5, Tr. 28) He had initially received an extension on \nthe 2013 Federal income tax filing due date, but that extension did not extend until the \nreturns were actually filed in June 2017. (Tr. 28) He did not request an extension for tax \nyear 2014 or 2015 because he believed he could do nothing with his 2014 or 2015 returns \nuntil he had filed his 2013 return. (Tr. 29)  \n \nOnce Applicant had obtained the bank statements and other missing document he \nneeded to file his 2013 return, he did so. (Tr. 30) Once his 2013 return was filed, he was \nable to complete his 2014 and 2015 returns. (Tr. 30) Applicant submitted a copy of his \n2013 Federal income tax return signed on February 1, 2017, copies of his 2014 and 2015 \nFederal income tax returns signed and dated June 26, 2017, and a copy of his 2015 state \nincome tax return signed and dated June 24, 2017. (Ex. B, C, D, E, and SOR Response4) \nHis 2015 Federal tax return listed wages of $85,152, a $9,528 business loss, $5,750 \nFederal tax withheld, and a refund due of $3,039. (Ex. B) His 2014 Federal tax return, \ndated June 26, 2017, listed wages of $83,205, an $8,998 business loss, $5,755 Federal \nincome tax withheld, and a refund due of $3,531. (Ex. C) His 2015 Federal tax return, \ndated June 26, 2017, listed wages of $97,183, a $469 business loss, $8,651 Federal \nincome tax withheld, and a refund due of $3,637. (Ex. D) He received a Federal tax \nextension for tax year 2016, and he made a timely filing of that year\u2019s returns. (Tr. 32) \n                                                          \n3 During 2013 and 2014, Applicant lived in a state that did not have personal income tax. (Ex. 1, Ex. 5) \n  \n4 The copies of Applicant\u2019s tax returns that accompanied his SOR Response were much more complete, \ncontained additional schedules and forms, and included an additional state return not included in the \ndocuments presented at the hearing.  \n\n \n4 \nApplicant used the refunds of $12,800 to pay his wife\u2019s student loan obligation and to \nmake payments on his debts. (Tr. 57) \n \nApplicant asserts he now has a better way of collecting the data he needs to file \nhis taxes. (Tr. 45) He is more vigilant and disciplined in the collection of the data. He now \nputs everything on a spreadsheet including a budget, when bills are due, and data needed \nwhen filing his tax returns. (Tr. 46) His wife pays her taxes on her business monthly. (Tr. \n48) \n \nIn April 2013, his 2005 Honda automobile was \u201ctotaled\u201d in the accident when he \nwas rear ended by an ambulance. (Tr. 21) The ambulance caved in the back end of his \nvehicle. (Tr. 21) On his e-QIP, he listed medical bills of $3,200 and incurred during the \naccident. (Ex. 1) He incurred $1,500 in medical bills for a rotator cuff injury, and his wife \nincurred $3,500 in medical bills for a dislocated disc. (Ex. 2, Tr. 21) He did not pay the \ndebts because he was waiting for settlement from the ambulance company. (Ex. 2, Tr. \n25) It took four years of working with the ambulance company\u2019s insurance company to \naddress a portion of the medical bills. (Tr. 23)  \n \nApplicant has continued making payments on his medical bills and has paid off \nnumerous medical bills. (Ex. L, N, O, X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC) He paid more than $5,000 on \nhis wife\u2019s medical bills resulting from the automobile accident. The SOR does not list any \nmedical bills as being past due, charged-off, or in collection.  \nAt the time of the accident, Applicant owed $11,093 on his vehicle. The insurance \ncompanies paid 75% of the car\u2019s value, which was $7,800 leaving a balance owed of \n$3,293 (SOR 1.d). (Tr. 24) The SOR lists an $8 charged-off account (SOR 1.d). Applicant \nadmits he owed $3,292 on the account. In June 2017, the creditor offered to settle the \ndebt for $1,317. (SOR Response) Applicant accepted and paid the settlement offer. (Ex. \nI, Tr. 42) The debt has been paid. His February 2018 credit report lists a zero balance \nand zero past due on this debt. (Ex. 6) \nBetween 1995 and 1999, Applicant incurred student loan obligations. (Ex. 2) He \nmade regular payments on his student loans until 2002 when unemployment caused his \npayments to become irregular. (Ex. 2, Tr. 55) At some point, he stopped making payments \nuntil 2004, when he started making irregular payments. He continued making irregular \npayments until the April 2013 automobile accident. (Ex. 2, Tr. 55) In 2015, the accounts \nwere again in forbearance. He requested forbearance so he could address some medical \nbills. (Tr. 34, 35) In a February 2018, Applicant\u2019s student loan services\u2019 provided a letter \nstating his student loan forbearance had been approved. (Ex. G) His next monthly \npayment of $167 was due on May 7, 2018. (Ex. 2, Ex. G, Ex. K)  \nApplicant\u2019s April 2015 credit report lists the two student loan obligations as being \n\u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d (Ex. 3) His August 2016 credit report lists the loans as being \napproximately $900 past due. (Ex. 4) His February 2018 credit report lists, both accounts \nwith zero past due. (Ex. 6) One student loan had a balance of $2,717 with a scheduled \n$17 monthly payments and the other had a balance of $28,971 with scheduled monthly \npayments of $182. (Ex. 6) The two student loans have now been consolidated into a \n\n \n5 \nsingle loan with monthly payments of $207. (Tr. 33) He provided documentation of timely \npayments of his $207 student loan payments through January 2019. (Ex. S, T, W, AD, \nAF) \nApplicant\u2019s April 2015 credit report, lists 15 accounts as being paid as agreed that \nincludes two student loans. (Ex. 3) The report also showed the auto loan on the wrecked \nHonda was listed as $2,675 past due. His most recent credit report, February 2018, listed \neight accounts all of which indicate a zero-past-due amount. (Ex. 6) As previously \ndiscussed, the auto loan was settled and paid. Applicant has read books on how to get \nout of debt, how to manage one\u2019s money, becoming debt free, and financial management. \n(Tr. 45) In March 2018, he attended the first session of a financial planning course. (Ex. \nM) In May 2018, he completed a financial planning course. (Ex. L) \n \nApplicant\u2019s $250 gas bill (SOR 1.g) was paid, and his most recent credit report \nlisted no amount as past due. (Ex. H) The $496 power bill (SOR 1.f) was paid, and there \nwas no amount past due. (Ex. J) The two utility bills were the last bills for services received \njust before he left the state and moved to his current state. (Tr. 43, 44) \n \nApplicant is current on his $1,800 monthly rent. He has a 2007 and two 2008 \nautomobiles, all of which were purchased used. (Tr. 50) His car payments were $600 \nmonthly. (Tr. 50) Following the hearing, he paid off two of his vehicles, thereby eliminating \nmonthly payments of $246 and $218. (Ex. 4, 6, L, AF) He is current on his utility bills, \ninsurance, and student loan payments. (Tr. 51) He has $3,200 in his 401(k) retirement \nplan. (Tr. 52) He contributes two percent of his wages to his retirement plan, which is \nmatched by two percent by his employer. (Tr. 53) He has approximately $3,000 in a \nsavings account and $1,800 in his checking account. (Tr. 58) Applicant is timely repaying \nhis former company\u2019s for tuition reimbursement. (Ex. R, U, V) \nOn Applicant\u2019s April 2015 e-QIP, he indicated he was currently working with his \nmortgage company to resolve a second mortgage debt incurred when he was unable to \nsell the home when his job relocated him to a new state in September 2011. (Ex. 1, Ex. \n2, Tr. 26) He had found a buyer for a short sale. The short sale was unsuccessful, and \nthe house went to foreclosure. (Tr. 54) Applicant\u2019s February 2018 credit report lists a zero \nbalance and zero past due on this debt. (Ex. 6) The debt was settled and paid. (Tr. 27, \n54) The mortgage debt was not listed as a debt of concern in the SOR.  \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 performance evaluation form indicated Applicant was always \npositive \nand \nencouraged \nother \nteam \nmembers. \nHis \noverall \nrating \nwas \n\u201cAchieved/Substantially Achieved.\u201d (Ex. F)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n6 \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n7 \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, \n2014, and 2015, and he failed to timely file his 2015 state tax return. Additionally, he owed \napproximately $27,000 on his student loans and had three additional charged-off debts, \nwhich totaled $744. AG \u00b6 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern any may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d \n \nSecurity concerns having been raised, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. September 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of \nexplanation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n\n \n8 \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nIn 2011, Applicant made a job-related relocation from Texas to Florida and in \nFebruary 2015, Applicant made another job-related relocation from Florida to his current \nstate. In April 2013, he incurred medical expenses when his automobile was \u201ctotaled\u201d in \nan accident. His vehicle was rear ended by an ambulance that caved in the back end of \nhis vehicle. His automobile insurance paid only 75 percent of the value of his vehicle. \nThese are factors beyond his control. When one job ends and a new job is in a different \nstate, the loss of employment and costs of moving are factors beyond one\u2019s control. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) applies.  \n \nApplicant has read books on how to get out of debt, how to manage one\u2019s money, \nbecoming debt free, and financial management. He attended multiple sessions of a \nfinancial planning course, which he completed in May 2018. Applicant is current on his \nutility bills, insurance, and his $1,800 monthly rent. He has paid off two of his automobile \nloans reducing his $600 monthly car payments by more than $450. He has $3,200 in his \n401(k) retirement plan, contributes regularly to his retirement plan has approximately \n$3,000 in a savings account, and $1,800 in his checking account. He is current on his \nstudent loan obligation, paid the three charged-off accounts, filed his delinquent tax \nreturns, and received sizable tax refunds. His financial counseling course was provided \n\n \n9 \nby a legitimate and credible source. There are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has limited applicability. Applicant had three debts in addition to his \nstudent loan obligation, which indicates his delinquent obligations were few. His initial \nfailure to file his 2013 tax return was due to a lack of documents necessary to prepare his \nreturn. He now has a better way of collecting the data he needs to file his taxes. He is \nmore vigilant and disciplined in his data collection, and he puts everything on a \nspreadsheet including a budget, when bills are due, so that the data needed is available \nwhen he has to file his taxes. It is unlikely his non-timely filing of his tax returns will recur. \nHis current handling of his finances does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant had three charged-off debts totaling $744, which have been paid. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies to these three debts. The largest listed SOR debts were his two student \nloan obligations that totaled just over $27,000. He is current on his student loan obligation. \nHis April 2015 credit report lists the two student loan obligations as being \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d \nHis August 2016 credit report lists the loans as being approximately $900 past due. His \nFebruary 2018 credit report lists zero past due on each account. He provided \ndocumentation of timely payments of his $207 student loan payments through January \n2019. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to his student loan obligation.  \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2013, 2014, and 2015 Federal income tax returns \nand his 2015 state income tax return in a timely manner. He requested various filing \nextensions, but the extensions did not extend until February 2017 and June 2017 when \nall the delinquent returns were filed. A willful failure to timely make (means completed and \nfiled with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal \noffense.5 The failure to timely file federal tax returns has security implications because: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \n                                                          \n5Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \n  \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to \nmake a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . . make \nsuch return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required \nby law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor . . . .  \n \nA willful failure to make tax return, keep records, or supply information when required, is \na misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, \n317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States \nv. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. \n1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nhis federal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. \n \n\n \n10 \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nThe Appeal Board ruled that \u201ceven in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016). \n \nIn this instance AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant has filed all delinquent tax \nreturns and received tax refunds totaling more than $12,800. He used the refunds to pay \nhis wife\u2019s student loan obligation and to make payments on various other debts. He \ninitially failed to timely file his 2013 Federal return because he did not have the necessary \ndocuments related to his wife\u2019s business. His tax filings were further delayed when his \ntax documents were boxed up when he moved in February 2015. He was in the process \nof filing his returns when things became misplaced during the move.  \n \nThe timing of an applicant\u2019s efforts at debt resolution is relevant in evaluating the \nsufficiency of his case for mitigation. Applicant began his efforts to resolve his tax issues \nproblems before he was placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy. In November \n2016, prior to the issuance of the June 2017 SOR, Applicant contacted the IRS about his \nfailure to file his 2013, 2014, and 2015 returns. He was granted an extension until \nDecember 2016 and told if he was unable to meet the deadline, he should continue \nworking to get them filed as soon as possible.  \n \nApplicant believed he was prevented from filing his 2014 and 2015 returns until he \nhad completed and filed the 2013 return. This is an incorrect, but understandable, \nassumption. In general, each tax year is an independent entity. In actuality, nothing \nprevents a taxpayer from completing a tax return simply because the prior year\u2019s return \nhad not been filed because a taxpayer is permitted to estimate information for filing when \nactual information is not available. 6 However, Applicant\u2019s assumptions are reasonable. I \n                                                          \n6 When tax information is unavailable, the taxpayer is supposed to provide a good-faith estimate and \ndisclose the estimation to the IRS. See American Institute of Certified Public Accountants website, \n\u201cStandards for Tax Services No. 4, Use of Estimates,\u201d \nhttps://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/tax/resources/standardsethics/statementsonstandardsfortaxservices/\ndownloadabledocuments/ssts-no.4-use-of-estimates.pdf.  \n \n\n \n11 \nfind Applicant\u2019s failure to complete his 2013 return is a reasonable explanation for his \nfailure to file his 2014 and 2015 returns in a timely manner.  \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s track record of filing his delinquent tax returns and receiving \nrefunds, paying or resolving the three other listed debts, being current on his student loan \nobligation, and current on his rent, car payment, utility bills, and his saving and retirement \naccounts, there are clear indications that his past financial problems are resolved and his \nfinances are under control. He has shown good faith in addressing his debts. He has \nsufficient income to keep his financial obligations in current status and to continue paying \nhis $207 monthly student loan obligation. I am confident that Applicant will conscientiously \nendeavor to maintain his financial responsibility. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate \nfinancial considerations trustworthiness concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant is a 42-year-\nold senior software engineer who has been employed by a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2015. He honorably served in the U.S. Navy from July 1994 through June 1995. \n \nThe largest of the SOR debts of concern were two student loan obligations, which \nare current. Incurring a student loan is seen as an obligation incurred to improve an \nindividual\u2019s life, with respect to future employment and career prospects, and, as such, is \nviewed differently than a debt obligation incurred to purchase a new car or incurred for \n\n \n12 \ncredit card debt. He filed his delinquent tax returns and has established a \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d in the repayment of his student loan obligation. Other than his student loan \nobligation, the only delinquent obligations listed on the SOR totaled less than $750. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nDOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. The issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been \npaid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He provided sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate \nhis history of financial problems, which are now largely resolved. Accordingly, this case \nis decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non September 6, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on May 25, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \n           \n             \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 13, 2017. He admitted the four delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR and provided brief explanations for each debt. He also \nrequested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 13, 2017. The hearing scheduled for \nJanuary 23, 2018, was postponed due to a government shutdown. The hearing took \nplace as rescheduled on April 18, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. \nDepartment Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-\n4. Applicant made an oral presentation and offered documentary exhibits, which were \nadmitted as Exhibits A-E. No witnesses were called other than Applicant.  \n  \nThe record was kept open until May 18, 2018, to allow Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional matters. He made a timely submission on May 7, 2018, and those \nmatters, along with accompanying e-mails, are admitted without objections as Exhibit F.  \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \npreviously granted to him. He is employed as a weapons and communications operator \nfor a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since 2011, and his \nplace of work is a military proving ground. His formal education includes a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree awarded in 2013. He and his wife have three children, ages 10, 6, and 1. His \nemployment history includes honorable service on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps \nduring 2006-2010, which included a deployment to Iraq. His wife is a military veteran \ntoo.  \n \nThe SOR concerns four delinquent debts consisting of two charged-off accounts \nowed to the same credit union, a $1,330 collection account stemming from a credit card \naccount, and a $91 medical collection account for a total of about $14,059. He disclosed \nthe debts in his September 2016 security clearance application. He also disclosed a \npast-due mortgage loan that had been resolved by modification of the loan. He \nattributed his financial problems to the 2014 timeframe when he and his wife went from \nfour streams of income or paychecks to one. They had four streams of income based on \ntheir jobs and both received GI Bill benefits as they were attending school. The \nreduction in income occurred when he graduated and his wife lost her job and \npostponed attending school. They quickly found themselves over their heads with the \nsingle paycheck from Applicant\u2019s job. The status of the four delinquent debts is \ndiscussed below. \n \nCharged-off loans for $8,160 and $4,478 obtained from same credit union.2 The \ninitial loan was made to finance the purchase of the car, and then another personal loan \n                                                          \n2 Exhibits B \u2013 E.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwas made, but it was secured by the car too. After defaulting on the loans, Applicant \nvoluntarily returned the vehicle, and the balances owed were charged off. The creditor \nunion then obtained a judgment in the amount of $13,436 plus $959 in attorney fees for \na total of $14,395 in November 2016. The judgment was paid and satisfied via a writ of \ngarnishment on both Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s paychecks, and the writ of garnishment \nwas released in February 2018. \n \nCollection account for $1,330. This debt stemmed from a credit card account that \nwas opened to finance the purchase of automobile tires. By the time the debt came to \nApplicant\u2019s attention, they were in their period of financial difficulty and unable to pay it. \nSince then, the balance on the account grew to more than $2,000, which Applicant \nresolved by agreeing to pay $1,450 in May 2018.3 \n \nMedical collection account for $91. Applicant was unaware of the debt until he \nsubmitted his 2016 security clearance application. He paid the debt in July 2017.4 \n \nIn addition to the four delinquent accounts in the SOR, an April 2018 credit report \nshows an unpaid medical collection account for $2,197. Applicant explained this debt \nstemmed from an injury he sustained while operating a Bradley Fighting Vehicle at \nwork.5 He understands the debt is covered by the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system \nand will be resolved in due course.6 \n \nApplicant earned a gross income of about $53,000 in 2017.7 His wife had \nrecently accepted a full-time teaching position to begin in fall 2018; previously she \nworked as a teacher\u2019s aide.8 He described their current financial situation as \u201cmuch \nmore stable,\u201d he has a $1,000 set aside for an emergency fund, and their joint checking \naccount had a balance of about $1,500.9 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n                                                          \n3 Exhibit F.  \n \n4 Exhibit F.  \n \n5 Tr. 42-46.  \n \n6 Exhibit F.  \n \n7 Tr. 37.  \n \n8 Tr. 37-38. \n \n9 Tr. 51-52.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.10 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.11 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d12 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.13 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.14 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.15 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.16 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.17 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.18 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.19 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.20 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n10 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n11 Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .21 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The two \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nConcerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant receives credit \nunder both AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d). His financial problems stemmed from a reduction in \nhousehold income. In particular, his wife\u2019s job loss and her decision to postpone \nattending school (via the GI Bill benefits) were unexpected events that resulted in a \nreduction of household income. More to the point, Applicant took sufficient action to \nresolve the four delinquent accounts in the SOR. Perhaps he could have acted sooner, \n                                                          \n21 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nbut his ability (cash flow) to do so was no doubt limited by the demands of supporting \nhis spouse and three children. His financial situation is now improved, he has stable \nemployment, and his spouse is transitioning into a full-time job. Taken together, it \nappears he has done a good job at putting his financial house in order.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

Ayotte, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 28, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 28, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 2, 2017. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nApril 25, 2018, scheduling the hearing for June 7, 2018.  \n01/09/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s exhibit list, discovery \nletter, and administrative notice request, as well as Applicant\u2019s exhibit list and \nmemorandum were appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, III, IV, and V, \nrespectively. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A through F, which I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, \nI kept the record open until June 21, 2018. Applicant did not submit additional \ndocumentation by that date. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 15, \n2018.1 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She is a 41-year-old, native-born \nU.S. citizen and resident. She obtained bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in 1999 and \n2003, respectively. She is married. She has three minor children; all are native-born \nU.S. citizens. She and her husband have owned their home in the United States since \nJuly 2004.2        \n \n  Applicant has worked for her current employer, a DOD contractor, since late \n2017. She worked for previous DOD contractors since 2004. She has held a security \nclearance since approximately 2008.3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband is 44 years old. He was born in Pakistan. He immigrated to \nthe United States on a student visa in 2001, at age 24. He and his family in Pakistan are \nreligious minorities, and he sought to escape the turmoil in Pakistan. He does not intend \nto return to Pakistan to live.4 \n \nApplicant met her husband online in 2003; she married him later that year. At the \ntime, he was in the United States in transition from a student to a work visa, and she \nwas working full time and pursuing her master\u2019s degree. He became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 2009 and he holds a U.S. passport. His Pakistani passport expired in 2009, he \nhas not since renewed it, and he has no intentions of doing so in the future.5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law died in 2011. Her father-in-law, brother-in-law, and one \nsister-in-law are citizens and residents of Pakistan, and her second sister-in-law is a \nPakistani citizen residing in Canada. Both Applicant and her husband testified that none \nof the family in Pakistan is affiliated with the Pakistani government or military. \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 10-18, 64, 89-90. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 18-35, 48, 64-79; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 7-8, 65-79; GE 1, 2; AE B. \n \n4 Tr. at 20-89; GE 1, 2, 3. \n \n5 Tr. at 20-89; GE 1, 2, 3. \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is 75 years old. He lives in a rental property in an affluent \nneighborhood that is protected by a guard. He works for a private company.6  \n \nApplicant communicates with her father-in-law telephonically once every two to \nthree months. She described her husband\u2019s relationship with his father as a close one. \nHer husband talks to his father two to three times weekly. Applicant and her husband \nvisited and stayed with her father-in-law in Pakistan for three weeks in 2006. They did a \nfew tourist activities but primarily stayed close to her father-in-law\u2019s neighborhood. Her \nfather-in-law kept their passports in a locked safe and made sure they were with his \ndriver-bodyguard anytime they left his neighborhood. Applicant has not since returned \nto Pakistan and she does not intend to in the future, primarily because she received her \nsecurity clearance but also because her father-in-law advised against it given the \npolitical climate there.7  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband and children have since traveled to Pakistan. They travel to \nPakistan every year to visit his father. They travel on their U.S. passports. As of the date \nof the hearing, Applicant\u2019s husband last traveled there in April 2017. He has no intention \nof visiting Pakistan once his father, sister, and sister\u2019s children no longer live there. For \ntwo weeks each in 2016 and 2017, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law visited and stayed with \nApplicant and her family in the United States. He was scheduled to revisit them in June \n2018. Through the sponsorship of Applicant\u2019s husband, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nobtained a green card in 2016. He intends to move to the United States and live with \nApplicant and her husband once her sister-in-law is approved to immigrate to Canada, \nas further discussed below.8 \n  \nApplicant\u2019s one sister-in-law is a Pakistani citizen residing in Pakistan.  She is 41 \nyears old. She is widowed, as her husband died in 2011, and she has two children. She \nis a teacher in a private elementary school. Applicant\u2019s husband sends his sister $200 \nmonthly, and he talks to her and her children two to three times weekly to biweekly. \nApplicant communicates with this sister-in-law telephonically twice yearly, primarily \nduring the holidays, in which they discuss their children or the health of Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law. Aside from meeting this sister-in-law\u2019s eldest child once, in 2006, \nApplicant does not have any contact with this sister-in-law\u2019s children. As of the hearing \ndate, this sister-in-law was in the process of trying to immigrate to Canada. Applicant \nexpected that this sister-in-law would be approved to immigrate to Canada by the end of \n2019.9  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is 37 years old. Applicant met her brother-in-law when \nshe visited Pakistan in 2006. Since then, their sole contact was electronically once or \ntwice between 2007 and 2008. Applicant testified that her husband\u2019s family fell out of \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 20-89; GE 1, 2, 3; AE F. \n \n7 Tr. at 20-89; GE 2, 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 20-89; GE 3. \n \n9 Tr. at 20-64, 71-89; GE 3. \n\n \n4 \n \ntouch with her brother-in-law. Applicant\u2019s husband testified that his father talks to his \nbrother once in a while. He also testified that he had not seen or heard from his brother \nsince around 2010, stating that \u201cwe have no connection.\u201d He testified that his brother is \nmarried to a Pakistani and they have one minor child. He also testified that he was \nunaware what his brother did for a living and whether he intended to remain in \nPakistan.10 \n \nApplicant\u2019s other sister-in-law is 38 years old. She is married and she has two \nminor children. This sister-in-law and her husband are Pakistani citizens residing in \nCanada. This sister-in-law immigrated to Canada in 2016, and she is in the process of \nbecoming a Canadian citizen. She works in office administration, and her husband is \nattempting to start his own business. Since Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law moved to Canada, \nthey talk to each other telephonically or electronically once every two to three months, \nprimarily about their children. Prior to that, when Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law resided in \nPakistan, they communicated minimally. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law visited Applicant and \nher family in the United States when she received her Canadian permanent residency \nand again in 2017. Applicant has never met or communicated with her sister-in-law\u2019s \nhusband.11 \n \nApplicant\u2019s assets in the United States, to include their home, total approximately \n$400,000, which does not include her children\u2019s savings accounts that are held by her \nparents. Applicant\u2019s husband received money from his father three times: (1) his father \npaid for the costs associated with his move to the United States; (2) his father gave him \nmoney when he immigrated to the United States; and (3) when his father sold the family \nhome in Pakistan in 2015, the proceeds of the sale were divided among Applicant\u2019s \nhusband and his three siblings, and Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s portion was $40,000. \nApplicant\u2019s husband put the $40,000 in a bank account in his name in Pakistan, and \ngave his father a power of attorney over the account in the event his father would need \nthe money. If Applicant\u2019s father-in-law does not need the money before he moves to the \nUnited States, Applicant\u2019s husband intends to transfer the money to the United States. \nAside from the money he sends to his sister-in-law in Pakistan, Applicant\u2019s husband \nalso sends $1,000 monthly to a charity in Pakistan that is run by his cousin, which \nsupports orphan children in schools. Neither Applicant nor her husband have any other \nforeign financial interests.12 \n \nApplicant testified that her husband is aware that she holds a security clearance, \nbut her foreign family members are not. She testified that neither he nor her foreign \nfamily members are aware about the specific nature of her work, as she does not \ndiscuss it with anyone. He is aware that her work is affiliated with the DOD. She testified \nthat she has always been compliant with annual security training requirements, and she \nreported her 2006 trip to Pakistan in accordance with such requirements. Both she and \nher husband testified that they would report to the proper authorities any attempts by \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 20-89; GE 3. \n \n11 Tr. at 20-64, 71-89; GE 3. \n \n12 Tr. at 20-89; GE 1, 2, 3. \n\n \n5 \n \nanyone to obtain information about her or the nature of her work. She indicated that she \nis loyal and bears a sense of allegiance and obligation only to the United States, and \nshe would resolve any conflict in favor of the United States.13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are native-born U.S. citizens. They are retired farmers, and \nher mother is also a retired registered nurse. Her father served in the U.S. military for \ntwo years. Applicant and her family are heavily involved in their community. Her children \nparticipate in Girl Scouts, and dance and swim lessons. A number of character \nreferences, to include members in her community, described her as honest and \ntrustworthy. Her direct supervisor noted that she is the consummate professional, and \nthat he had no reason to question her loyalty, integrity, or commitment to the United \nStates.14 \n \nPakistan  \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against all non-essential travel to \nPakistan. Travel by U.S. Government personnel within Pakistan is restricted. Terrorist \ngroups continue to pose a danger to U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan, and evidence \nsuggests that some victims of terrorist activity were targeted because they are \nAmericans. Although al-Qaida in Pakistan has been degraded, its global leadership \ncontinued to operate from remote locations in the region that the group has historically \nexploited for safe haven. Pakistan did not take substantial action against the Afghan \nTaliban or Haqqani Network, or substantially limit their ability to threaten U.S. interests \nin Afghanistan. Pakistan has also not taken sufficient action against other externally-\nfocused groups such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad in 2016, which \ncontinued to operate, train, organize, and fundraise in Pakistan.  \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department\u2019s 2016 Human Rights Report for Pakistan indicates \nthat the most serious human rights problems in Pakistan were the following: (1) \nextrajudicial and targeted killings; (2) disappearances; (3) torture; (4) lack of rule of law; \n(5) gender inequality; and (6) sectarian violence. Other human rights problems included \narbitrary detention, governmental infringement on citizens\u2019 privacy rights, a weak \ncriminal justice system, and a lack of judicial independence. There were government \nrestrictions on freedom of assembly and limits on freedom of movement. Government \npractices and certain laws limited freedom of religion, particularly for religious minorities. \nCorruption within the government and police, as well as discrimination against women \nand girls remained serious problems. Societal discrimination against national, ethnic, \nand racial minorities persisted, as did discrimination based on caste, sexual orientation, \nand gender identity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 20-35, 67-89; GE 3; AE D. \n \n14 Tr. at 35, 65-68; AE C, E. \n\n \n6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, one sister-in-law, and brother-in-law are Pakistani \ncitizens residing in Pakistan. Applicant met her brother-in-law once in 2006 in Pakistan \nand she last communicated with him in 2008. Applicant\u2019s husband last communicated \nwith his brother in 2010, and he does not have a relationship with his brother. However, \nboth Applicant and her husband maintain close contact with Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nand sister-in-law in Pakistan, and Applicant\u2019s father-in-law maintains contact with \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law. As such, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, and 1.c.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), and 7(e).   \n \nWhile Applicant only visited her in-laws in Pakistan in 2006, her father-in-law has \nvisited her and her family in the United States as recently as 2016 and 2017. In \naddition, her husband and their children have visited her father-in-law and sister-in-law \nin Pakistan at least once yearly since 2006. Applicant and her husband also maintain \nregular contact with her father-in-law and sister-in-law. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. As discussed above, however, Applicant only met her brother-in-\nlaw once in 2006 and she last communicated with him in 2008. Applicant\u2019s husband last \ncommunicated with his brother in 2010, and he does not have a relationship with his \nbrother. As such, AG \u00b6 8(c) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen. She has lived in the United States her \nentire life. She obtained her education in the United States. She has worked for \nvarious DOD contractors since 2004. Her assets in the United States total \napproximately $400,000. While her husband has $40,000 in a bank account in \nPakistan, and sends money to his sister as well as a charity owned by his cousin in \nPakistan, they do not have any other foreign financial interests or any expectation of \ninheriting any such interests. He plans on transferring the $40,000 to the United States \nonce his father moves to the United States, and his sister is in the process of moving \nto Canada. AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this \nguidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Edmunds, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn July 17, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication \nFacility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E Personal Conduct).1 In \na September 6, 2017, response, Applicant answered the allegations and requested a \nhearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. \nI was assigned the case on June 12, 2018.  \nA June 20, 2018, notice was issued which set the hearing for August 22, 2018. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered five documents, \naccepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-5. Applicant offered \ntestimony and 16 exhibits, accepted without objection as Exs. A-P. The record was held \nopen through August 31, 2018, in the event either party wished to submit additional \nmaterials. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on August 30, 2018. On \nAugust 31, 2018, Applicant offered what was marked as Ex. P. With no objection \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/29/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nforthcoming, the item was accepted on September 1, 2018, and the record was closed. \nBased on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to \nmitigate sexual behavior and personal conduct security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old reliability engineer who has worked for the same entity \nfor nearly six years. He has earned a bachelor of science degree, three master\u2019s \ndegrees, and a doctorate degree. In the interim, he accepted a commission in the U.S. \nArmy, where he began with his Army Reserves unit in 1987. He was transferred to the \nretired Army Reserves as a lieutenant colonel after 26 years. Most recently, he \ncompleted seminary school and became a chaplain at the rank of major.  \n \n \nIn 2007, Defense Criminal Investigative Services (DCIS) and Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) conducted a national investigation that identified over \n5,000 U.S. individuals, some with DOD affiliations, who subscribed to known child \npornography websites. In 2007, Applicant returned from a deployment with a compact \ndisc (CD) of some military orders and sermons. (Tr. 24, 37) He did not realize the orders \nwere sensitive or otherwise protected. (Tr. 41) Applicant also returned suffering from \nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s home was searched as part of the DCIS and CID national \ninvestigation. He admitted viewing adult content of a titillating nature on the Internet. \nApparently, no images of underage individuals, however, were found and archived that \nwere noted as pornographic. (Tr. 34-36) The past military orders, however, were found. \nApplicant claimed that someone had given him permission to have the orders, but he \nwas unable to provide a name or documentation reflecting permission was given. A \nwritten warning for mishandling classified information was issued.   \n \nWhen Applicant came back from his next deployment in 2011, his estranged wife \ntold him that two deployments was too much for their marriage, and that she wanted a \ndivorce. (Tr. 22) Their five year marriage would end in divorce in 2013. (Tr. 17-18) After \nshe moved away, he had difficulty sleeping. As a result, he would spend the nights on \nthe computer viewing pornography. (Tr. 19) \n \nIn late 2010, DCIS and CID determined that its previous investigational checks \nhad left several leads insufficiently examined or deficiently investigated. (Ex. 3 at 2) In \nJune 2011, Applicant was again investigated by DCIS/CID for possession of child \npornography. This entailed reopening the 2007 investigation, during which time the lab, \nwhich had lost its evidence from 2007, inspected new material. (Tr. 36). Also, a mix-up \nof some sort led to a hard drive that did not belong to Applicant being made part of the \ninvestigation.  \n \nDuring the interview, Applicant was asked if he had any unauthorized charges to \nhis credit card. He answered a charge had been made for a hotel. When specifically \nasked about a particular website he had visited, he chose to end the interview and \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nconsult an attorney. (EX. 3 at 2) His clearance and access were suspended in August \n2012. (Ex. 2) Later, four to six images were discovered on Applicant\u2019s media, two \nimages were identified as containing known child victims identified by the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).2 (Ex. 3 at 3) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant returned from another deployment. At the conclusion of the \ninvestigation, the Assistant U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to prosecute due to \nevidentiary deficiencies and statute of limits issues. (Ex. 3) Local prosecutors similarly \ndeclined to prosecute the matter.3 However, a Memorandum of Reprimand (MOR) was \nissued to Applicant on January 26, 2013. He was given 15 days from receipt of the \nMOR to respond in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation. (Ex. 2) A general officer\u2019s letter \nof reprimand dated January 26, 2013, was issued, determining that child pornography \nand unsecured classified material was found at Applicant\u2019s home. (Ex. 2) This fact was \nfound to be particularly \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d because Applicant is an Army \nchaplain. (Ex. 3 at 4) The reprimand became final in April 2013. Applicant was \ntransferred to retired reserve status on May 1, 2013, with the recommendation his \nsecurity clearance be revoked. (Ex. 2)  \n \nApplicant disagrees with the assessment of the military that the images at issue \nwere child pornography. Applicant has viewed the photos, noting that some were nude, \nwhile others included scanty clothing. He testified that he had never seen the photos \nbefore. Throughout the hearing, Applicant stressed the models were not engaged in \nsexual activity and, therefore, could not be deemed child pornography, per se. Applicant \nrepeatedly acknowledged that his reputation would be harmed if the issues regarding \nsexual behavior became public knowledge.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to the AG, \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept,\u201d each of which must be fully considered in making a decision. \n                                                          \n2 In December 2012, four of the children were determined to be underage by professionals according to \nbody habitus and other criteria. (Ex. 3 at 4)  \n \n3 It is noted that the lack of criminal charges does not preclude a finding that an applicant engaged in the \nconduct underlying the cited offenses nor does it indicate such offenses are entitled to little weight. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 12-11795. \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility and will be \nresolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the record evidence. \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted \nfacts alleged in the SOR. Under the Directive, an applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nDecisions are in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination \nas to the loyalty of the applicant.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior  \n \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual.  \n \nApplicant began viewing Internet-derived pornography for entertainment at some \npoint in his life prior to 2007. He was identified by DSIC and CID as an individual whose \ncredit card had been linked to known child pornography websites. His premises and \nmedia were inspected in 2007, but the inspection was deemed inadequate in 2010. In \n2011, he was again subject to investigation. He quit complying with investigators when \nasked about a specific website known to offer child pornography. What was deemed to \nbe child pornography was found, but the Assistant U.S. Attorney and local authorities \ndeclined to prosecute due to issues involving the material and the statue of limitations.  \n \nThe military, however, found the investigative findings and Applicant\u2019s conduct to \nbe particularly \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d because Applicant is an Army chaplain. \nA formal reprimand was issued and became final in April 2013. As a result, Applicant \nwas transferred to retired reserve status on May 1, 2013, with the recommendation his \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nsecurity clearance be revoked. His sexual behavior has thus became a concern \nbecause he is now susceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress and it could \nadversely affect his reputation, esteem in the community, judgment, and his ability to \nfind or keep a job.   \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a disqualifying condition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 13 (a):  sexual behavior of a criminal nature . . . ; \n \nAG \u00b6 13 (b): pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; \n \nAG \u00b6 13 (c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 13 (d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment.  \n \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 13 (a) and AG \u00b6 13 (c) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (a): the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and \nthere is no evidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature;  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, \nor under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and \ndiscreet; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 (e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment.  \n \nThe behavior at issue occurred in Applicant\u2019s middle years. Applicant\u2019s continued \nprotestation that the material at issue was not child pornography, despite the fact this is \nnot the forum to appeal previous findings by DCIS and the military, makes it difficult to \njudge whether such behavior could recur. The established facts of record in the \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits do tend, however, to bring into question Applicant\u2019s judgment \nand current reliability. Two of the children were identified as having been previously \nidentified as missing or exploited children, obviating application of AG \u00b6 14 (d). \nApplicant is not currently in treatment or a recent graduate of an appropriate program. \nTherefore, I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \nHere, Applicant was the subject of the aforementioned investigation regarding \nchild pornography in 2007 and in 2010. While federal and local prosecutors declined to \nprosecute, the military issued a formal reprimand seriously condemning the behavior \nexhibited, and the disgrace wrought by one of its own chaplains under these \ncircumstances. Applicant admits public knowledge of the facts involved would harm his \nreputation. Also, Applicant was found with sensitive or protected information on his \npersonal media during the 2007 investigation. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(e) applies.    \n \nI have considered these facts in light of the AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions. I find \nthe following potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nHere, the offenses at issue are particularly worrisome, as issues both reflecting \npoor judgment and a lack of trustworthiness. Applicant attempted to absolve himself of \nresponsibility for the sensitive or protected material by stating he was told he could \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \npossess the material, but he failed to provide a name or documentary evidence \nsupporting this claim. On one hand, Applicant continues to deny having downloaded \nchild pornography, on the other hand, he failed to show how the Government\u2019s \ndocumentary evidence is incorrect. Further, in neither situation of misconduct has he \nraised any mitigating facts that would tend to show some form of similar conduct, be it \nintentional or accidental, will not occur in the future. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nMoreover, by fearfully keeping the matter private, he failed to give rise to AG \u00b6 17(e). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline D and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, materials, and references.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with notable questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude sexual behavior \nand personal conduct security concerns remain unmitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

I conclude she has mitigated the \nsecurity concern. Clearance is granted.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 21, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June \n8, 2018. \n \nOn July 13, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting subparagraphs 1.a \nthrough 1.d, and denying the remainder. She requested a hearing, whereupon the case \n \n\n2 \n \nwas assigned to me on July 20, 2018. On September 13, 2018, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for October \n10, 2018. The hearing was held as scheduled. I received five Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 \nGE 5) and twelve Applicant exhibits (AE A - AE L). I marked another exhibit as AE M for \nidentification purposes, but did not incorporate it into the record. I also incorporated a copy \nof the discovery letter that Department Counsel mailed to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I). At \nthe close of the hearing, I left the record open to November 10, 2018 for Applicant to \nsubmit additional documents. Within the time allotted, she submitted three additional \nexhibits that I received as AE N through AE P.  On January 9, 2019, Applicant moved for \nthe admission of two additional exhibits (AE Q and AE R). Department Counsel did not \nobject to their admission, therefore I re-opened the record and admitted the documents. \nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on October 19, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old single woman with four children. The oldest child is a \nteenager, the middle children are five-year-old twins, and the youngest is three months old. \nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in health science in 2016. (Tr. 19) From August \n2015 to December 2017 she worked as a medical administrative assistant. Her duties \nincluded helping service members transfer from active duty to civilian life. (GE 1 at 12) She \nleft the job after her clearance was denied (Tr. 74), and was unemployed until September \n2018, when she gained a part-time job as a paralegal. (Tr. 14) According to Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor when she worked as a medical administrative assistant, she was an impressive \nemployee who provided great care to the service members. (AE O) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges approximately $35,000 of delinquent debt. The debts alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c are delinquent car loans. Subparagraph 1.a, totaling \n$14,233, is a loan used to finance the purchase of a car in 2011. (GE 5 at 9) She kept up \nwith payments for eight months until she stopped receiving child-support payments from \nher oldest child\u2019s father in December 2011. (GE 3 at 1)  The car was repossessed in 2012. \n(Tr. 68) \n \n \nIn September 2012, Applicant purchased another car, financing it with a loan \nsecured by the creditor alleged in subparagraph 1.c. (Tr. 35; GE 3 at 2) Three months later, \nshe discovered that she was pregnant with her twins. By May 2013, recurring difficulties \nrelated to the pregnancy required her to go on bedrest. (Tr. 36) Unable to work, she fell \nbehind on her car note. (GE 5 at 9; Tr. 33)   \n \n \nWith the help of her mother, who cosigned the loan, Applicant purchased an \nautomobile in 2015. When she applied for the loan, the loan officer told her the \ndelinquency on the loan, alleged in subparagraph 1.c, was too high to roll into the new car \nloan. Consequently, he advised her to allow the car secured by the loan alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.c to be repossessed. (Tr. 32) Kicking the deficiency down the road would \nenable her to secure a loan for the purchase of the new car. Applicant then lost her job. \nSubsequently, she defaulted on the loan, and the car was repossessed, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.b. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 32) \n\n3 \n \n \n \nIn sum, all three cars that Applicant purchased between 2011 and 2015 were \nrepossessed. In November 2017, Applicant wrote each creditor a letter with a proposed \npayment plan. (AE G \u2013 H) Under each respective plan, she proposed to satisfy the \ndelinquencies with $100 monthly payments. (AE G \u2013 H) Shortly after writing the automobile \ncreditors, Applicant lost her job, and just regained part-time employment one month before \nthe hearing in September 2018. (Tr. 42, 74)  She has been unable to execute any of the \nproposed payment plans.  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d is a loan for which Applicant applied during \nthe period when she was not working and on bedrest in 2013. (Tr. 42) When Applicant lost \nher job, the account became delinquent in the approximate amount of $1,106. (Tr. 42-43) \nApplicant contacted the creditor and agreed to a payment plan. Per the agreement, she \nwas to pay $140 per month. (Tr. 42) In December 2017, she lost her job, rendering her \nunable to make the payments. (Tr.  42) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e is a delinquent utility bill in the amount of $228. This delinquency \ncoincided with the period of time when she was not working and on bedrest. (Tr. 21) In \nNovember 2017, Applicant contacted the creditor to arrange payment. (Tr. 44) Per the \nagreement, the creditor was supposed to automatically debit her account. They never did, \nand Applicant never called them again. (Tr.  45)  \n \n \n \nThe creditor alleged in subparagraph 1.f is an insurance company that insured one \nof the repossessed cars. (Tr. 45) The alleged delinquency is $136. Applicant disputed this \ndebt, contending that, per the auto insurance agreement, she always paid the insurance \npayment in advance of the month she received the insurance coverage. (Tr. 45) She \nsuccessfully disputed the debt and it was removed from her credit report. (45-46) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g is a delinquent repair bill owed to a rental-car company for \ndamages incurred in 2010 when Applicant was in a car accident with a rental car. (Tr. 47) \nThe delinquency totals $2,311. She disputes the bill, contending that she opted for car \ninsurance, but the rental company did not include it in the contract. (Tr. 47) She provided \nno evidence in support of her dispute. \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h, is a credit-card debt totaling $483. It has been delinquent since \nApril 2010. (GE 2 at 5) Applicant satisfied it through $50 monthly payments from \nSeptember 2015 to June 2016. (GE E at 7) She has reported payment of this debt to the \ncredit reporting agency and is seeking to have it removed from her credit report. (GE E at \n7) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i stems from eviction-related costs from an \napartment where Applicant lived from June 2012 to May 2013. (Tr. 51) The alleged \ndelinquency totals $3,819. Applicant denies this account, but provided no evidence in \nsupport of her contention that she does not owe it. \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j is an alleged delinquent hospital bill totaling $3,132. Applicant \ndisputed this bill, contending that she received the treatment, but her medical insurance \ncovered it. (Tr. 54) She contacted her insurance company, who resubmitted the insurance \ninformation at her request. (Tr. 54) She then contacted the credit agency and had this bill \nremoved from her record. (AE F) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.k is a disputed medical bill totaling $319.  \nApplicant contacted the credit-reporting agency and had the debt deleted from her record. \n(AE F) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.l is a disputed parking ticket totaling $240. \nApplicant contacted the credit agency and had it removed from her credit report. (AE F) \n \n \nSince Applicant answered the SOR and began reaching out to creditors, her \nfinancial situation has worsened. Specifically, after she discovered she was pregnant with \nher fourth child, her boyfriend demanded that she terminate the pregnancy. (Tr. 74) When \nshe refused, he kicked her out of his home. (Tr. 74-75) Although the three oldest children \nstayed with him, Applicant was left without a steady home address during the period that \ncoincided with her unemployment. While unemployed, she was unable to follow through on \nthe delinquent car note payment plans, and incurred approximately $1,700 of additional \ndelinquent debts. (Tr. 70)  \n \n \nApplicant gained a part-time job in September 2018.  It pays $1,770 per month. (Tr. \n14) She remains without a fixed home address. Realizing that she would not be able to \nsatisfy her delinquencies under these circumstances, she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection in October 2018. By January 8, 2019, the bankruptcy court had administered her \nestate and closed the proceeding. (AE Q) The record does not contain the schedule of the \ndischarged debts. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n\n5 \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n6 \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems and their ongoing nature trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nEmployment instability and erratic child-support payments have significantly \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. In addition, on one occasion, she followed the \nadvice of an unscrupulous car dealer who proposed that she strategically default on a \nprevious auto loan to obtain a new car.  \n \n \nApplicant has satisfied one of her delinquencies in its entirety (subparagraph 1.h). \nShe has successfully disputed the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.f, and 1.k through 1.l. \nAfter experiencing her most recent job loss, which coincided with an unexpected pregnancy \nand homelessness, Applicant realized that she would be unable to satisfy the delinquent \ndebts, and decided, instead to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. It is unclear from \nthe record whether all of the debts were discharged in the bankruptcy. Moreover, AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is only partially applicable because Applicant did not provide concrete evidence of \nactions to resolve the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.g and 1.i. Nevertheless, the \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control, the initial steps taken to resolve them before her \n\n7 \n \nmost recent unexpected personal setback, and the effort to obtain Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection are sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d).  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nApplicant did not incur her delinquent debts as the result of foolish or irresponsible \noverspending. Instead, they resulted from a number of personal crises. Currently, Applicant \nis underemployed, with a baby, and no stable living arrangement. Given these \ncircumstances, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection is a reasonable solution to her \nfinancial problems. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-person concept, \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984, and completed master\u2019s degrees in 1996 and 2009. He enlisted in the Navy in 1978, and was discharged in 1979 and placed in the Inactive Reserve while attending college.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the sexual behavior, handling \nprotected information, and personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nMarch 20, 2012. He was interviewed by government investigators in April, June, July, \nand September 2010; July 2011; and January 2015. He also answered interrogatories \nfrom the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) in July and August 2017. \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 10, \n2017, alleging security concerns under Guidelines D (sexual behavior), K (handling \nprotected information), and E (personal conduct). Applicant answered the SOR on \nAugust 31, 2017, and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge.  \nDOHA assigned the case to me on April 13, 2018, and issued a notice of hearing \non July 20, 2018, setting the hearing for August 1, 2018. At the hearing, the \nGovernment offered three exhibits (GE 1 through 3), which were admitted into the \n01/16/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nrecord without any objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented no \nadditional evidence.

His SOR and hearing \nadmissions are accepted herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He received his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1984, and completed master\u2019s degrees in 1996 and 2009. He \nenlisted in the Navy in 1978, and was discharged in 1979 and placed in the Inactive \nReserve while attending college. He was commissioned as a Navy officer in 1984, and \nserved honorably until retired as a lieutenant commander in 2002. Applicant married his \nwife in 1992. They have a daughter, age 24, and a son, age 22.  \n \nApplicant has been working for federal contractors since he left the service in \n2002. He held a top-secret clearance while in the service. His clearance eligibility has \nbeen continued while employed with federal contractors. He seeks the continuation of \nhis clearance, which is required for his employment with a federal contractor. \n \nIn about 2010, Applicant applied for a job with another Government agency \n(Agency) that required him to participate in polygraph-assisted interviews. After a series \nof interviews, Applicant disclosed, in substance, all of the facts alleged in the SOR \nallegations:  \n \n1. When he was about 13 years old, while babysitting for a friend of the family, he \ntouched, and on a second occasion, he penetrated, a three-year-old girl\u2019s vagina with \nhis finger while getting aroused. He was never caught, but stopped his behavior \nbecause he knew that what he was doing was wrong. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n2. Applicant started having uncomfortable feelings about his daughter - a strange \nsexual attraction - when she started puberty. He was afraid that he would do something \nstupid. When his daughter and her friends were about 13 years old (in about 2009), \nApplicant began sexually fantasizing about his daughter and her friends and \nmasturbated two to three times per month to those fantasies. Applicant denied he ever \ntouched his daughter or her friends inappropriately or that he acted on his fantasies \n(other than masturbating). (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant told the Agency investigator that he stopped his sexual fantasies in \nabout May 2011. (GE 3) At his hearing, Applicant testified that he stopped having the \nsexual fantasies after his interview with the last investigator in January 2015. (Tr. 39) \n \nAfter his 2010-2011 interviews, the Agency reported Applicant\u2019s statements to \nthe state\u2019s social services agency who investigated the concern. Applicant\u2019s family was \ninterviewed, and apparently he was cleared of sexual misconduct. \n \n3. In about 1988, Applicant removed documents from a sensitive compartmented \ninformation facility (SCIF) and took them to his home to study for an exam. Sometime \nlater, he returned the documents to the SCIF. He also took submarine qualifications \ncards (marked confidential) as souvenirs. Applicant averred that at the time he took the \ncards, he did not know they were marked confidential. During a move in 1999, he \ndiscovered they were marked confidential. Applicant did not return or properly dispose \nof the cards after he discovered they were classified confidential. He maintained \npossession of the cards until 2010 when an Agency investigator asked him to surrender \nthem to him. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) \n \n4. In about 2009-2010, Applicant took computer equipment home without \nauthorization from his federal contractor employer. The equipment included, in part, a \nserver with five drives, eight to ten keyboards, mice, a wireless router, network cables, \nthree laptops, three docking stations, and cables for hard drives. Applicant explained \nthat he was asked to recycle old computer equipment under his control before the \ncompany moved to another location. Part of his job was to create mock computer labs \nfor testing and studies. He did not recycle the equipment and took it home because he \nbelieved he would need it to establish mock computer labs. Applicant did not asked for \nauthorization to take the equipment home. After he participated in four Agency \ninterviews, Applicant returned the equipment to his then employer to recycle it. \nApplicant donated some of the computer equipment he wrongfully appropriated to his \ndaughter\u2019s school robotics lab. \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 3.f alleges that Applicant deliberately omitted and failed to disclose \nmaterial information to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background \ninvestigator. Applicant participated in an interview with an OPM investigator in January \n2015. During the interview, he was asked whether he had sexual fantasies or \nmasturbation habits related to minors. Applicant admitted to having fantasies and that \nhe masturbated to pornography of young women, but specifically denied any sexual \nfantasies or masturbating habits related to minors. Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose to the OPM investigator all the information he disclosed during his four \ninterviews with the Agency investigators about his sexual fantasies and masturbation \nhabits concerning his minor daughter and her friends as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 3 g alleged that Applicant deliberately omitted and failed to disclose \nmaterial information to an OPM background investigator when he failed to disclose the \ntrue extent of his unauthorized taking of computer equipment from his employer as set \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nforth in SOR \u00b6 3.e. During his 2015 interview, Applicant admitted to, on one occasion, \ntaking home a computer shell (stripped of parts) except for its power supply. Applicant \ndeliberately omitted and failed to disclose that he had taken home, at least, a server \nwith five drives, eight to ten keyboards, mice, a wireless router, network cables, three \nlaptops, three docking stations, and cables for hard drives. \n \nWhen questioned about his omissions and failure to disclose the same \ninformation he disclosed to Agency investigators in 2010-2011, Applicant stated he did \nnot see the need to disclose the information because he assumed the investigator had \nread his statements to Agency investigators in 2010-2011. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \n \nAt age 13, Applicant sexually molested a three-year-old girl by twice fondling her \nvagina while getting aroused. When Applicant\u2019s daughter and friends were about 13 \nyears old (in about 2009), Applicant began sexually fantasizing about his daughter and \nher friends and masturbated frequently to those fantasies. He admitted to having a \n\u201cstrange sexual attraction\u201d to his then minor daughter. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual fantasies (thoughts) are not \u201cbehavior\u201d that could raise a \nconcern under the AGs, and there is no evidence he acted on his fantasies, except for \nhis masturbating habit. His masturbation occurred in the privacy of his home, and it \nremained private until he disclosed his masturbating habit to Agency investigators \nduring his 2010-2011 interviews. His sexual behavior then became a concern because \nhe is now susceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant would like to \nprevent others from knowing about his masturbating habits and sexual fantasies \ninvolving his minor daughter and her friends because it would adversely affect his \nreputation, esteem in the community, judgment, and his ability to find or keep a job.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature . . . ; \n \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s frequent masturbating habit to sexual fantasies about his underage \ndaughter and her friends raises concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b) and (c). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(a) and (b) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant was 13 years old at the time \nhe sexually molested the three year old girl, and there is no evidence of similar behavior \nduring the following 45 years.  \n \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s sexual fantasizing and masturbating to thoughts of his \ndaughter and her friends, there is no evidence to show Applicant ever acted on his \nfantasies (other than masturbating) or that he inappropriately touched a minor. His \nsexual behavior (masturbating) was strictly private. Applicant claimed that as a result of \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nthe state\u2019s social services investigation in 2011, his wife became aware of his sexual \nbehavior towards his minor daughter and her friends. If true, the basis for possible \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress would be diminished. However, Applicant failed to \npresent independent evidence to corroborate his testimony about his wife\u2019s knowledge \nand her forgiveness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(c) and (d) apply, in part, to SOR \u00b6 1.a, but they do not \ncompletely mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has not participated in any \ncounseling or treatment. AG \u00b6 14(e) does not apply. \n \nApplicant testified that he stopped sexually fantasizing and masturbating about \nhis daughter and her friends in 2015. Thus, I consider his questionable behavior recent. \nI note that Applicant told the Agency investigator that he stopped his sexual fantasies in \nabout May 2011. (GE 3) However, at his hearing, Applicant testified that he stopped \nhaving the sexual fantasies after his last interview with a Government investigator in \nJanuary 2015. (Tr. 39) \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information - raises \ndoubt about an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern.1 \n \nSecurity clearance cases require administrative judges to assess whether an \napplicant has the requisite good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to be \nentrusted with classified information. When evidence is presented that an applicant \npreviously mishandled classified information or violated a rule or regulation for the \nprotection of protected information such an applicant bears a very heavy burden in \ndemonstrating that they should once again be found eligible for a security clearance.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s removal of documents classified confidential from a SCIF in 1988, \nand his taking and keeping the submarine qualification cards after he realized they were \nclassified confidential in 1999, raise the following Guideline K security concerns.  \n \nAG \u00b6 34(b): collecting and storing protected information in any \nunauthorized location; and \n \n                                            \n1 AG \u00b6 33. \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 11-12202 at 5 (App. Bd. June 23, 2014) (very heavy burden standard); ISCR \nCase No. 01-25941 at 5 (App. Bd. May 7, 2004) (security clearance determinations are \u201cnot an exact \nscience, but rather predicative judgments.\u201d). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34(g): any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified \nor other sensitive information. \n \nAfter considering the conditions that could mitigate the security concerns one is \npartially applicable to the facts in this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 35(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened \nso infrequently or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant returned to the SCIF the document he removed from it to study in \n1988. He found out that the submarine qualification cards he took as souvenirs were \nclassified confidential during one of his moves in 1999. However, he kept the submarine \nqualifications cards even after realizing they were classified confidential. Applicant was \ncommissioned in 1988, served in the Navy as an officer, and held a clearance until he \nretired in 2002. He was aware of the security rules that required him to protect classified \ninformation, to return the classified documents or destroy them, and to then notify his \nsecurity officer of his violation of the security rules. He failed to do so and retained the \nsubmarine qualifications cards until he was asked to hand them over to an Agency \ninvestigator in 2011. There is no evidence of additional security violations after 2011. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security infractions were deliberate, or the result of a reckless or even \nnegligent disregard for security rules and regulations. There is no evidence to show that \nafter his security violations ended (2011), Applicant established a strong reputation for \nfollowing and complying with security rules and regulations. Nor is there evidence of \nadditional training to prevent such security violations in the future.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . .  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleges in \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.d, the same \nfactual concerns alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and 2.a and 2.b. Because those concerns \nwere fully addressed under Guidelines D and K, for the sake of brevity my findings, \nanalysis, and conclusions under those guidelines will be incorporated herein without \nrepeating them. \n \n \nAdditionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant was less than candid and \nforthcoming during an official interview with an OPM investigator in 2015, when he failed \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nto disclose the full extent of his sexual fantasies and masturbation habits involving his \nminor daughter and her friends as disclosed to Agency investigators during interviews in \n2010-2011. (SOR \u00b6 3.f) During his 2015 interview, Applicant stated that he masturbated \nto pornography involving young women, but denied sexually fantasizing and \nmasturbating about minors. When cross-examined at hearing about the substantial \ndiscrepancy in his statements in 2010-2011 to those made in 2015, Applicant explained \nthat he believed the OPM investigator had access to and had read his statements to the \nAgency, and as such, he did not have to repeat the information.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that in 2009-2010, he wrongfully appropriated computer \nequipment from his federal employer and did not return the equipment until confronted \nabout it during at least four interviews with Agency investigators in 2010-2011. The \ncomputer equipment taken included, at least: a server with five drives, eight to ten \nkeyboards, mice, a wireless router, network cables, three laptops, three docking \nstations, and cables for hard drives. (SOR \u00b6 3.e) \n \n \nApplicant was less than candid and forthcoming during an official interview with \nan OPM investigator in 2015, when he failed to disclose the full extent of the numerous \ncomputer parts that he wrongfully appropriated from his employer. During his 2015 \ninterview, he admitted to taking home only one computer shell with a power supply and \nsome cables. He claimed that he had stripped out the hard drive and other components \nfrom the computer shell. He stated that he donated the computer shell to his daughter\u2019s \nhigh school. When cross-examined at hearing about the substantial discrepancy in his \nstatements, Applicant explained that he believed the OPM investigator had read his \nprior statements to the Agency, and as such, he did not have to repeat the information. \n(SOR \u00b6 3.g) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing \nor omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . .  \n \n \nThe record established the above disqualifying conditions, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of the mitigating conditions. I considered the \nfollowing mitigating conditions set forth by AG \u00b6 17 as partially raised by the evidence: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant was 13 years old when he sexually molested the 3-year-old girl. (SOR \n\u00b6 3.a) There is no evidence to show Applicant has been involved in any similar behavior \nduring the last 45 years. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies and mitigates this allegation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual fantasies (thoughts) are not \u201cbehavior\u201d that could raise a \nconcern under the AGs, and there is no evidence he acted on his fantasies, except for \nhis masturbation habit. His masturbation practices occurred in the privacy of his home, \nand it remained private until he disclose his masturbation habit to Agency investigators \nduring his 2010-2011 interviews. His sexual behavior is a concern because he is \nsusceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant would like to prevent others \nfrom knowing about his masturbation habits and sexual fantasies involving his minor \ndaughter and her friends because it would adversely affect his reputation, esteem in the \ncommunity, put into question his judgment, and his ability to find or keep a job. Thus the \nreason he deliberately omitted the information during his 2015 interview.  \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in counseling. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not applicable. AG \u00b6 \n17(e) is partially applicable because Applicant and his family were interviewed by state \nsocial services and apparently he was cleared of the allegations. He testified that his \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nwife forgave him for his past sexual behavior; however, he failed to present \ncorroborating evidence to support his claim. Notwithstanding, its partial applicability, AG \n\u00b6 17(e) does not fully mitigate the concerns. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find \nthat the Guideline E allegations continue to raise concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), (c), and \n(e), which are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, K, \nand E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under that \nguideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant, 58, served in the Navy and was honorably retired after 20 years of \nservice. He has been employed with federal contractors since he retired in 2002. He \nheld a clearance while in the service that has been continued while working for federal \ncontractors to present.  \n \nNevertheless, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a \nsecurity clearance. Unmitigated security concerns lead me to conclude that granting a \nsecurity clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.f:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 3.g:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He has two daughters, the oldest of which is in college, and the youngest is a sophomore in high school. But for a period of unemployment from April 2014 to January 2015, Applicant has been employed by defense contractors for 33 years.2 The SOR alleges that Applicant: (1) filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2015 which is in progress and he is delinquent on trustee payments; (2) filed a Chapter 13 bankrukptcy in November 2012, which was converted to a Chapter 7 in November 2014, and which was discharged in February 2015; (3) is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $14,830 (tax year 2013), which is included in the current bankruptcy case; (4) is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $6,805 (tax year 2015); (5) is indebted to his state of residence for $5,000, which is included in the current bankruptcy case.3 Applicant answered the SOR as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant admitted that he filed a Chapter 13 in March 2015.

Owens, Esq.   \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the security concern stemming from his bankruptcy filing and his federal and \nstate tax liabilities. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 16, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that his \ncircumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 15, 2017, and requested a hearing to establish his \neligibility for continued access to classified information.1 \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.    \n12/20/2018\n\n2 \n \n \nOn July 19, 2018, a date mutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. \nApplicant testified, and the exhibits offered by the Government were admitted into the \nadministrative record without objection. (Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 3.) Applicant \noffered no exhibits, but his Answer to the SOR attached three documents, which I have \nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was \nreceived on July 27, 2018. At the request of Applicant, without objection, the record \nremained open until July 31, 2018. Applicant timely submitted two documents, which I \nmarked as AE D and E and which were admitted without objection.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 59 years old, a college graduate, and married (since 1988) with four \nchildren. He has two sons, the oldest of which has graduated from college, and the \nyoungest son is in college. He has two daughters, the oldest of which is in college, and \nthe youngest is a sophomore in high school. But for a period of unemployment from April \n2014 to January 2015, Applicant has been employed by defense contractors for 33 \nyears.2 \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant: (1) filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2015 \nwhich is in progress and he is delinquent on trustee payments; (2) filed a Chapter 13 \nbankrukptcy in November 2012, which was converted to a Chapter 7 in November 2014, \nand which was discharged in February 2015; (3) is indebted to the IRS in the amount of \n$14,830 (tax year 2013), which is included in the current bankruptcy case; (4) is indebted \nto the IRS in the amount of $6,805 (tax year 2015); (5) is indebted to his state of residence \nfor $5,000, which is included in the current bankruptcy case.3  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant admitted that he filed a Chapter 13 in March 2015. He did so \nto fend off his home mortgage company from foreclosing on his home after his November \n2012 Chapter 13 was converted to a Chapter 7 and discharged in February 2015. \nApplicant denied that he is delinquent on his plan payments and said he is current. In fact, \nApplicant said he is about $4,000 ahead of schedule, because he pays every two weeks, \ninstead of monthly.4  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant admitted that he filed a Chapter 13 in November 2012. He \ndid so because his wife had been laid off from her job, they fell behind in their mortgage \npayments, and the mortgage company repeatedly denied requests to modify the \nmortgage payments. Applicant filed for Chapter 13 because the mortgage company \nstarted foreclosure proceedings.5 \n                                                          \n2 Tr. 12-13; GE 1.  \n \n3 SOR \u00b6 1. \n \n4 Answer \u00b6 1.a. \n \n5 Answer \u00b6 1.b. \n\n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant admitted the 2013 IRS deficiency but offered two \nexplanations. First, his wife was working for a nonprofit organization, was paid as a 1099 \nemployee, and Applicant underwithheld. Second, Applicant\u2019s wife was awarded a bonus \nthat put them into a different tax bracket, and they had underwithheld. The IRS is receiving \npayments on this debt under the current Chapter 13 payment schedule.6 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant admitted the 2015 IRS deficiency but explained that he has \nadded this debt to the current Chapter 13 payment schedule.7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant denied that he is delinquent on his state taxes. He claimed \nthat those taxes are being paid under the Chapter 13 payment plan.8 \n \nApplicant testified about the circumstances that led to his financial problems. \nBefore those problems arose, his wife was employed as a nurse educator, one who taught \nhealth education to at-risk patients. At the end of 2009 or early 2010, her employer \nunexpectedly eliminated her full-time position and cut her back to 16 hours per week. At \nthe time, she was making about $75,000 per year. The cut in hours reduced her pay by \nmore than 50%.9  \n \nAs a result, Applicant fell behind on the home mortgage and immediately applied \nfor a loan modification. The mortgage company told him that he had to be three or more \nmonths in default in order to do a modification. So, with that advice, Applicant stopped \nmaking payments for three months and reapplied. Then the mortgage company said that \nin order to do a modification, he would need to pay those three months of arrears. \nApplicant could not afford to do so. The mortgage company told Applicant he could apply \nfor the Making Housing Affordable program.  He did, and that was denied, as well. In \nshort, Applicant applied for some form of relief from the mortgage company several times. \nAll were denied.10 \n \nIn May 2010, Applicant\u2019s wife took another nursing job, but even though it was full \ntime, it was not permanent, and the employer had to renew her job every three months. \nIn addition, it was not a wage-paying job, but was a 1099 independent contractor position. \n                                                          \n \n6 Answer \u00b6 1.c. \n \n7 Answer \u00b6 1.d. \n \n8 Answer \u00b6 1.e. \n \n9 Tr. 13-14. 37.  \n \n10 Tr. 14-18; Answer \u00b6 1.b. The grounds for each denial appear to be pretextual, especially since the \nmortgage company continued to urge Applicant to reapply after each denial (e.g., insufficient employment \nhistory, inadequate tax returns, inter alia). In fact, the mortgage company was ultimately successfully sued \nin a class action suit for predatory lending practices. Tr. 15, 34. Applicant was awarded damages of $1,000.   \n \n \n\n4 \n \nThe employer, therefore, was not withholding state and federal income taxes. Applicant \nand his wife, by miscalculation, underwithheld taxes. This caused some but not all of \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies.11  \n \nIn accordance with the mortgage company\u2019s instruction about needing to be in \ndefault to reapply for a loan modification, Applicant continued not making mortgage \npayments. In July 2012, the mortgage company began foreclosure proceedings. \nApplicant retained counsel and reapplied for a loan remediation. That was denied. On \nadvice of counsel, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 2012 to stay the \nforeclosure. At about the same time, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s left her month-to-month job and \ntook a full-time permanent job at a nursing home.12  \n \nAt about the time the Chapter 13 was approved by the court (November 2012), \nApplicant\u2019s employer chose to consolidate the operations of three facilities. Applicant was \na supervisor at one of those facilities. The consolidation reduced the number of \nsupervisors from 12 to 7. Applicant was making $118,000 per year. Applicant applied for \none of those supervisory positions, but he was not awarded it. As a result he took a job \nwith another defense contractor in June 2013 at $125,000 per year. Applicant worked for \nthat defense contractor until April 2014, when he was laid off due to a reduction in the \nworkforce. He was given a two-month severance and a bonus.13  \n \nEven after being laid off in April 2014, Applicant was still making his mortgage \npayments (and paying other debts) through the Chapter 13 trustee. He accomplished that \nby withdrawing money from his 401(k) plan. That would ultimately lead to enhanced tax \nliabilities, because Applicant was under the age of 55, and those withdrawals were taxed \nas ordinary income plus a 20% penalty. That contributed significantly to Applicant\u2019s \nincome tax liabilities.14 \n \nBy November 2013, Applicant had consumed all of his liquid finances to stay \ncurrent with his Chapter 13 payments. His counsel recommended that Applicant convert \nthe Chapter 13 to a Chapter 7. The goal was to get a clean start. That was not what \nhappened, because his original bankruptcy lawyer recommended that Applicant\u2019s wife \nnot join him in the Chapter 13 proceeding, in order to protect her credit rating. His wife, \nhowever, although not on the deed was liable on the mortgage note. Therefore, she was \nnot protected by Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13. In hindsight, Applicant believed he received bad \nlegal advice not to include his wife in the Chapter 13. Applicant converted the Chapter 13 \nto a Chapter 7 in November 2014.15 The Chapter 7 was discharged in February 2015. \nNot long after that discharge, the mortgage company started foreclosure proceeding \n                                                          \n11 Tr. 16-17.  \n \n12 Tr. 17-19.  \n \n13 GE 1; Tr. 21-22.  \n \n14 Tr. 22-23.  \n15 At that time, Applicant was still unemployed. GE 1.   \n \n\n5 \n \nagainst Applicant\u2019s wife, because she had not been on the Chapter 13 or the Chapter 7 \nand, therefore, had no protection from liability on the mortgage note.16   \n \nIn January 2015, the defense contractor who had laid him off in June 2013 rehired \nhim at about $111,000 (which included an $8,000 signing bonus), which was a reduction \nfrom the $125,000 salary he was receiving before his last employer laid him off. In March \n2015, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 to stay the foreclosure proceeding that the mortgage \ncompany had started against his wife. That Chapter 13 is still active today.  The mortgage \ncompany\u2019s foreclosure suit has been suspended in light of the Chapter 13. The state has \nrepeatedly moved to dismiss the foreclosure suit, but the mortgage company responds \nby requesting that the suit\u2019s suspension be extended for 90 days, and the state repeatedly \nagrees to those requests.17 \n \nApplicant testified about the status of his currently active Chapter 13. All of the \nSOR debts (Federal tax debts and state tax debt through 2015) and the mortgage \ncompany debt (not alleged in the SOR) are included in the Chapter 13 payment plan. He \nhas never been delinquent on his plan payments. He has $1,170 automatically deducted \nevery two weeks to pay to the plan. Applicant is two months ahead on plan payments. \nApplicant submitted documentation showing those payments from June 2015 through the \ndate of the hearing. He exits the plan in March 2020.18  \n \nApplicant testified about his reasons he filed his first bankruptcy. In 2012, \nApplicant\u2019s home was seriously \u201cunderwater.\u201d In July 2012, the mortgage company filed \na foreclosure suit. Applicant knew that if the mortgage company successfully foreclosed \non his home, there would be a substantial deficiency owed. Because Applicant could not \npay that deficiency, he would be defaulted. His credit rating would have prevented him \nfrom purchasing another home. Applicant\u2019s four children were deeply rooted in the \ncommunity. In short, Applicant would have lost money and would not have been able to \nprovide housing for his family. Filing a Chapter 13 in November 2012 stayed the \nforeclosure and prevented those detrimental results. Applicant converted that Chapter 13 \nto a Chapter 7, because, as noted, by November 2013 Applicant had depleted his liquid \nassets to make the Chapter 13 plan payments.19 \n \nApplicant testified about is current finances. Applicant makes about $103,000 per \nyear but recently was given a 5% raise. His wife makes $93,000 per year, and last year \nshe was given a performance bonus. He has made no large purchases. Applicant\u2019s two \nchildren in college have partial scholarships, have taken student loans, or otherwise have \npaid for themselves. He has not co-signed any student loans because of the Chapter 13. \nHe has three autos, a 2003 car with 110,000 miles, a 2002 car with 315,000 miles, and a \ncar with 267,000 miles. They are all paid off. Applicant does all his own car maintenance \n                                                          \n16 Tr. 23-24.  \n \n17 Tr. 24-26. \n  \n18 Tr. 25-30, 49-50; AE B, C, and D. \n \n19 Tr. 18, 34-35.  \n\n6 \n \nto save money. He is current on his 2016 and 2017 taxes. Applicant and his wife manage \ntheir household expenses and \u201cwatch every penny.\u201d20  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair \nnotice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is \nnot subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n20 Tr. 24, 30-32, 50-51. Counsel for Applicant will be paid at the end of the Chapter 13 proceeding, and that \nwill be worked out with Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy counsel.   \n\n7 \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of delinquent debts, which \npurportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations \nsecurity concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.21 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n AG \u00b6 19(f): failure . . . to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, \nmy obligation is to examine the way an applicant handles his or her personal \nfinancial obligations to assess how he or she may handle their security \nobligations.22 Here, Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility was called into \nquestion by his two bankruptcies and his past state and federal income tax \ndelinquencies. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) \napply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s financial woes began in late 2009 or early 2010 when his wife\u2019s \nemployer unexpectedly eliminated her full-time job and severely cut her hours back by \nmore than 50%. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by an unusual chain of bad \ncircumstances largely beyond his control and unlikely to recur. Filing Chapter 13 and \nstaying current on plan payments was responsible conduct under the adverse financial \nconditions Applicant was confronting. Applicant is financially prudent and is current with \nhis taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (g) apply.23    \n \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion \nto show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      For Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \n \n \n    For Applicant \n                                                          \n22 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). \n \n23 Applicant\u2019s loss of employment and his wife\u2019s loss of employment are circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol, which mitigates the filing of Chapter 13 bankruptcies to protect their home from foreclosure under \nAG \u00b6 20(b). Failure to pay income taxes, while understandable under these circumstances, is not \nresponsible conduct under AG \u00b6 20(b). Therefore, Applicant gets only partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant\u2019s current Chapter 13 plan, although it includes payments of back taxes, is not technically an \narrangement with the appropriate tax authorities. I find, however, that it is the functional equivalent of such \nan arrangement such that AG \u00b6 20(g) applies.    \n \n24 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \n\n9 \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information. \n \n  \n____________________ \nPhilip J.

In July 1999, at age 18, he was \ncharged with driving under the influence (DUI) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a). This was his first DUI. \nThough his blood alcohol content (BAC) was under the legal limit, he was convicted of \nDUI due to a zero tolerance violation for consuming alcohol as a minor. His driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for six months, he was ordered to complete a six-month alcohol \nprogram, and he was fined $100.3   \n \n \nIn July 2001, at age 20, Applicant was charged and convicted of underage \npossession of alcohol. He was in college and he threw a party where alcohol was \npresent. He was sentenced to one year probation, 50 hours community service, and \nalcohol counseling (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a). He completed individual alcohol counseling from \nAugust to December 2001. During this period, he consumed beer a few times weekly.4   \n \n                                                     \n1 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 20, 90; GE 1, 2. \n  \n2 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 7, 20-22, 44, 63, 78; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 22-23, 42-44, 61-62, 65, 78-81; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. \n \n4 Tr. at 23, 42-44, 62-63, 65, 80-81; GE 1, 2, 4, 6. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), \nBAC .15% to .20%, 1st offense. This was his second and last alcohol-related offense \nwhile driving. He had a few drinks while watching football at a bar. As he was driving to \nhis parents\u2019 home, he hit a patch of ice and his car slid into a ditch. A police officer \nasked him if he had been drinking and he said \u201cYes.\u201d He was convicted of reckless \ndriving and fined $250 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a). He consumed two to three beers three to four \ntimes weekly during this period.5  \n \n \nIn June 2012, Applicant was disciplined for reporting to work hungover and \nsmelling of alcohol. He had consumed alcohol the night before. This was his first and \nonly alcohol-related incident at work. He was consequently involuntarily terminated from \nemployment in August 2012 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 2.a). He consumed six beers daily during this \nperiod. He also started drinking hard liquor in October 2010, after his long-term \nrelationship of five years ended; he found himself battling depression; he isolated \nhimself; and he used alcohol as a coping mechanism. His mother testified that she \nobserved Applicant begin to binge drink on the weekends in 2010, which had not been \nhis normal behavior. He also withdrew from participating in family events and he did not \nanswer her telephone calls.6  \n \n \nIn October 2012, Applicant was charged and convicted of drunk in public (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.a). He was fined $25. He was walking to his residence from a convenience \nstore when the police stopped him because he was stumbling. When the police asked \nhim if he had been drinking, he said \u201cYes.\u201d The police arrested him, took him to the \npolice station, and advised him to pay the fine, which he did. He consumed two beers \ndaily and more on the weekends from June to October 2012. He was still in denial about \nhis alcoholism.7 \n \n \nBy March 2014, Applicant\u2019s level of alcohol consumption had escalated. He \nconsumed primarily hard liquor, and \u201cmore than the average person drinks in a sitting.\u201d \nHe asked his mother for help and she took him to the emergency room, where he was \nheld until a bed was available for him at an addiction treatment services program. His \nBAC was .392%. He disclosed his family history of alcoholism. For the first time and for \nfour days, he received inpatient alcohol treatment. He was diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 2.a).8 \n \n \nAfter completing treatment, Applicant was sober for one month. He then resumed \nconsuming alcohol. By his November 2014 background interview, he consumed alcohol \napproximately two times weekly (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 2.a). By April 2015, his alcohol \nconsumption had escalated to an average of eight to twelve drinks daily, prompting him \nto again contact his mother for help. She helped him enroll in a 28-day inpatient alcohol \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 23-24, 42-44, 63-65, 78-79, 82; GE 1, 2, 4, 6. \n \n6 Tr. at 24, 42-44, 51, 65-69, 83-85, 118-127; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 7. \n \n7 Tr. at 24-25, 42-44, 67-69, 82; GE 2, 4, 7. \n \n8 Tr. at 25-27, 42-44, 69-72, 81-83, 118-127; GE 3, 4, 7. \n\n \n4 \n \ntreatment program at an addiction treatment center. He received treatment through May \n2015, and he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, continuous (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 2.a).9  \n \n \nApplicant has been sober since the day he entered the April 2015 treatment \nprogram. Though he knew he had an issue with alcohol when he enrolled in the March \n2014 treatment program, he had neither accepted that he is an alcoholic nor taken \nresponsibility for such knowledge and his recovery until April 2015. He testified that the \nday he entered the April 2015 treatment program was: \n \n[A] pivot point for me . . . a moment of clarity, that there was a lot more to \nmy life that I could be doing, and that I needed to ask for help. I found \nstrength in asking for help, that I couldn\u2019t find within, and I sought \ntreatment that day. \n \nDuring his final week at the 2015 treatment program, he was elected the male \ncommunity representative--a role through which he helped the other men in the \nprogram.10 \n \n \nApplicant complied with the recommendations of his treatment counselor after his \n2015 discharge from the treatment program: he attended 90 Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) meetings in 90 days; he obtained an AA sponsor; and he saw a licensed \nprofessional counselor weekly. As of the date of the hearing, he was still attending AA \ndaily; he was in daily contact with his AA sponsor; he was also in daily contact as a \nsponsor for an individual in recovery; and he was seeing his licensed professional \ncounselor weekly to biweekly. In 2016, the counselor diagnosed him with alcohol \ndependence in full sustained remission. He intended to continue attending AA, \nremaining active in his AA community, and seeing his counselor, whom he viewed as a \ncoach that has taught him different coping strategies for life\u2019s stressors.11 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he learned through both the 2015 treatment program and \nAA that his previous failure to remain sober hinged on his thinking that he could handle \nhis alcoholism on his own, rather than reach out to others for help. He also learned that \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t drink safely or like other people could, and that I was fully alcoholic\u201d and \n\u201cthere are consequences when I drink.\u201d A friend from AA since 2016 testified that \nApplicant is a \u201crock\u2026 [h]e knows what to do and he does it consistently and he does it \nalways.\u201d12 \n \n \n \nApplicant signed a statement of intent in June 2018 to abstain from using alcohol \non penalty of losing his security clearance. He testified that he now has a social life, and \nhe enjoys fishing, playing guitar, and reading books. He is also a part of his family\u2019s \n                                                     \n9 Tr. at 25-32, 42-44, 72-74, 88, 116-127; GE 3, 4, 5. \n \n10 Tr. at 28-39, 41-42, 45-47, 52-60, 73-78, 85-98, 116-138; AE A, D, G. \n \n11 Tr. at 32-39, 41-42, 45-47, 52-60, 75-78, 85-98, 116-138; AE A, D, G. \n \n12 Tr. at 28-39, 41-42, 45-47, 52-60, 73-78, 85-98, 116-138; AE A, D, G. \n\n \n5 \n \nlives, talking to his mother often, spending a lot of time with his father, and he values \nbeing involved as an uncle to four minor children.13  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from September 2016 to December 2017 is a retired \nbrigadier general and a former deputy director for a federal government agency from \n2014 to 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he was the vice president for a business \nunit within the company. He testified that he first met Applicant in 2014, when Applicant \nworked for him as an executive assistant in a contractor capacity until 2015, when the \nwitness left the government agency. He then hired Applicant to work for him at their \ncurrent company in 2016. He described Applicant as an outstanding performer. He \nidentified Applicant as a high potential employee and gave him a top performance rating \nin 2017.14  \n \n \nThe witness testified that he first became aware of Applicant\u2019s challenges with \nalcohol in 2014. The witness testified that Applicant\u2019s mother also informed him about \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 treatment for alcoholism the day Applicant entered the program, and \nhe observed Applicant\u2019s impressive work performance when Applicant returned to work \nafter completing treatment. The witness also testified that he reviewed the SOR, and \nApplicant was forthright about his issues with alcohol and his efforts to address them. \nWhile the witness was aware of Applicant\u2019s history with alcohol, he testified that he did \nnot believe that anyone else at work was and that there was some speculation among \nseveral individuals at their prior job of Applicant\u2019s challenges. The witness testified that \nhe has seen Applicant on numerous occasions in social situations where alcohol is \npresent, and described Applicant as firm in his decision to not consume alcohol. The \nwitness indicated that he had no doubts that Applicant has turned his life around. \nNumerous professional and social character references describe Applicant as a superb \nemployee and a man of exemplary character, with demonstrated integrity and \ntrustworthiness.15 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n                                                     \n13 Tr. at 40-42, 44-45, 47-52, 54, 56, 58-60, 89, 91, 116-127; AE B, C, D, E, F. \n \n14 Tr. at 44-45, 74, 98-116; AE B, C, D, E. \n \n15 Tr. at 44-45, 74, 98-116; AE B, C, D, E. \n\n \n6 \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nconvictions. He was also terminated from employment in 2012 after reporting to work \nhungover and smelling of alcohol. He was diagnosed with alcohol dependence when he \nreceived inpatient alcohol treatment in 2014, yet he maintained sobriety for only one \nmonth before he began drinking again. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) \nare applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant relapsed after he received alcohol treatment in 2014 and was \ndiagnosed with alcohol dependence. As such, AG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. However, \nApplicant has been sober since his April 2015 entrance into a 28-day inpatient alcohol \ntreatment program. He accepted then that he is an alcoholic, and he took responsibility \nfor such knowledge as well as his recovery. He completed the 2015 treatment program \nand he complied with the counselor\u2019s recommendations upon discharge. He has seen a \nlicensed professional counselor weekly to biweekly since 2015, and the counselor \ndiagnosed him in 2016 with alcohol dependence in full sustained remission. He \nattended 90 AA meetings in 90 days, he has since attended AA daily, and he intends to \ncontinue to attend AA in the future. He has an AA sponsor and he is an AA sponsor for \nanother individual in recovery. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) are established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s  \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nconvictions, his 2012 employment termination after reporting to work hungover and \nsmelling of alcohol, and his relapse one month after his 2014 alcohol treatment and \nalcohol dependence diagnosis reflect questionable judgment and unreliability. His \nformer supervisor testified that Applicant\u2019s history with alcohol is not commonly known \nby others at work. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) apply. \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline G analysis, I find that \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the alcohol consumption and personal conduct security concerns.  \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009 which was dismissed in 2012, that he has 40 delinquent debts totaling $66,165, and that between 1990 and 2014, he was arrested and charged with fraudulently issuing worthless checks. The debts include: 25 medical accounts totaling $5,284; mortgage-loan arrearages of $9,376; deficiency balances on three repossessed vehicles totaling $37,498; an $8,222 judgment; and several small consumer accounts. In his Answer, Applicant admits the bankruptcy and the 25 medical debts and 8 of the other debts, denies 7 of the debts, and admits the worthless checks charges. The debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from July 2017 and February 2017. (GX 4; GX 3.) His admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 53-year-old program analyst currently employed by a defense contractor since October 2016, and periodically employed in the defense industry since 2007. He and his wife married in 1991 and have a 13-year-old son. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance. (GX 1.) After high school, Applicant worked for a local manufacturing plant for many years and was generally able to support his family on his income. In 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife opened her own business, which she continues to operate. Her income from the business is minimal and unreliable, and sometimes she does not generate any income.

However, Applicant did not \nintentionally issue worthless checks and repaid the amounts owed, and otherwise \nmitigated the financial concern by acting responsibly under the circumstances. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on November 3, 2016. \nOn July 25, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n03/19/2019\n\n \n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on August 8, 2017, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November 1, \n2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 6, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D were admitted without objection. I left the record \nopen until June 20, 2018, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. \nHe timely submitted AX D and AX E, which I have admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009 which was \ndismissed in 2012, that he has 40 delinquent debts totaling $66,165, and that between \n1990 and 2014, he was arrested and charged with fraudulently issuing worthless checks. \nThe debts include: 25 medical accounts totaling $5,284; mortgage-loan arrearages of \n$9,376; deficiency balances on three repossessed vehicles totaling $37,498; an $8,222 \njudgment; and several small consumer accounts. In his Answer, Applicant admits the \nbankruptcy and the 25 medical debts and 8 of the other debts, denies 7 of the debts, and \nadmits the worthless checks charges. The debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau \nreports (CBR) from July 2017 and February 2017. (GX 4; GX 3.) His admissions in his \nAnswer are incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old program analyst currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2016, and periodically employed in the defense industry since \n2007. He and his wife married in 1991 and have a 13-year-old son. This is Applicant\u2019s \nfirst application for a security clearance. (GX 1.)  \n \n \nAfter high school, Applicant worked for a local manufacturing plant for many years \nand was generally able to support his family on his income. In 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife \nopened her own business, which she continues to operate. Her income from the business \nis minimal and unreliable, and sometimes she does not generate any income. When the \nmanufacturing plant closed in 2003, Applicant was initially unemployed. He worked odd \njobs and used his savings to support his family. In an effort to increase his employability, \nApplicant enrolled in college in 2008. He graduated in 2012 with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and \nhas been taking master\u2019s degree level courses since June 2016. (GX 1; Tr. 18; Tr. 20-21; \nTr. 23.)  \n \n \nBetween 2007 and 2012, Applicant worked for a federal contractor in a low-paying, \nunskilled position. Due to ongoing financial strains, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin December 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). From 2009 until September 2012, Applicant paid \napproximately $1,500 a month on his bankruptcy payment plan through an automated \npayroll deduction. He was laid off from his federal contractor job in September 2012 and \nwas financially incapable of maintaining the payments while providing basic living \n\n \n3\nnecessities for his family. The bankruptcy was dismissed for noncompliance with the \npayment plan in April 2013. (Tr. 30; GX 3.) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from September 2012 to February 2013; from \nSeptember 2014 to March 2015, and from January 2016 to September 2016 (Tr. 19-20; \nGX 1.) He was unable to afford health insurance during the periods of unemployment, \nand primarily due to his wife\u2019s and his son\u2019s chronic medical issues, incurred numerous \nmedical debts. (Tr. 72-73.) \n \nApplicant denies liability for the $10,201 vehicle-loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.w. \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle was repossessed for nonpayment after he had been laid off for more \nthan 10 months. He initially negotiated repayment arrangements with the creditor, \nhowever, the creditor reneged on the agreement. (Answer.) Despite Applicant\u2019s position \nconcerning this debt, the creditor sent Applicant a 1099-C Cancellation of Debt, which \nApplicant properly filed and paid the appropriate taxes for the forgiven debt amount. (Tr. \n39-40.) This debt has been resolved. \n \nApplicant denies the $8,222 judgment entered against him in November 2010 by \na merchandise-franchising company. (SOR \u00b6 1.dd.) Applicant considered entering a \nbusiness venture with the company. The company requested Applicant\u2019s personal contact \ninformation for the stated purpose of sending Applicant an invitation to a vendor show. At \nthe show, Applicant collected information about the company, but did not sign a contract \nor make any other commitments to enter into a business venture with it. Without his \npermission, the company shipped merchandise and supplies to Applicant. He attempted, \nwithout success, to return the shipments. Applicant\u2019s calls and letters to the company \nwent unanswered or unreturned. The company eventually stopped sending merchandise \nto Applicant, but he received an invoice demanding payment for the merchandise he \nreceived and was unable to return. He refused to pay the invoice, but again stated his \nwillingness to return the items.  \n \n \nThe company sought a judgment against Applicant. Applicant was served by the \nsheriff, and began in earnest trying to reach representatives from the company in order \nto prevent the matter from going to court. Applicant did not appear in court because he \ndid not understand the process or the consequences of his failure to appear. (Tr. 47-48.) \nA default judgment was entered against Applicant for the full amount in November 2010. \nHowever, the company did not pursue collection of the default judgment and the judgment \ndoes not appear on Applicant\u2019s July 2017 CBR. (GX 4.) \n \n \nApplicant has paid $15,060, through garnishment of $200 per pay period, on the \n$16,367 judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ee. Applicant purchased a vehicle which never ran \nproperly. He voluntarily relinquished the vehicle to the seller, which sought and was \ngranted a judgment against Applicant for the vehicle-loan balance. (AX A; Tr. 48-49.) This \ndebt is being resolved. \n \n \nApplicant paid the past due balance of $9,376 (SOR \u00b6 1.hh) owed for his mortgage-\nloan through a six-month repayment agreement with the mortgage lender which was \n\n \n4\ncompleted in June 2017. He is occasionally late with his mortgage-loan payments, but \nhas not fallen into arrears since satisfying his repayment plan. (GX 4; Tr. 51- 52.) This \ndebt has been resolved. \n \n \nIn early 2018, Applicant contracted with the credit-repair firm in an effort to resolve \nhis delinquent accounts. Due to the high fees, Applicant terminated his relationship with \nthe firm and attempted to resolve his delinquent accounts on his own by contacting many \nof the creditors and attempting to enter repayment plans. His efforts were not particularly \nsuccessful, and he again retained the credit repair firm in May 2018. (Tr. 37-39.) The $762 \nand $527 consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.bb and 1.cc were paid through the credit-\nrepair firm. Applicant disputed the $424 consumer debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.gg and the \n$200 and $70 medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.ll and 1.mm through the credit-repair \nfirm and they have been removed from Applicant\u2019s CBR. (AX B; Tr. 32-33.) \n \n \nApplicant denies the $959 and $568 cellular-telephone services debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p. Applicant changed service carriers with the understanding that the \nnew service carrier would buy out any remaining contractual obligation Applicant had with \nthe previous service carrier, and that both service carriers were paid in full through such \nan agreement. Several months after changing carriers, Applicant received a list of \ncharges, but no explanation, from each of the carriers. He is disputing these debts through \nthe credit-repair firm. (Tr. 36-38; Answer.) \n \n \n  Applicant has contacted the creditors of the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.n, 1.q through 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.ii through 1.kk, and 1.nn, and will begin repayment \nof these accounts as soon he is able. (Tr. 35-36; Tr. 38; Tr. 42.) Applicant contacted the \ncreditor for the $10,930 delinquent vehicle-lease debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.aa, and stated \nthat it was his intention to enter a repayment plan once his medical debts were resolved. \n(Tr. 41.) Applicant contacted the creditor for the $588 payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.t) and is \nnegotiating payment arrangements. The $506 past-due debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.z is for \na one-month arrearage on the vehicle loan for Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s vehicle. She has regular \ncontact with the creditor and is working to bring this account current. (Tr. 41-42.)  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s wife periodically failed to timely file her quarterly tax \nreturns for her business and was delinquent on her tax payments. Applicant established \na payment plan with the IRS and the IRS also withheld Applicant\u2019s tax refunds for several \nyears to offset the balance due. The IRS contacted Applicant several years ago to inform \nhim that the account had been placed in a non-collectible status. Applicant recently \ncontacted the IRS and was informed that there is no current balance due. (AX F; Tr. 62-\n64.) \n \nIn 1990, 2009, and 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with fraudulently \nissuing worthless checks. In each instance, Applicant was experiencing financial strains \nand wrote checks for necessities, usually groceries, with the intention of depositing money \ninto his checking account to ensure that the checks would clear. However, he was unable \nto do so and the checks bounced. Applicant made full restitution and paid the requisite \ncourt costs. Applicant never intended to commit a fraudulent or illegal act, is remorseful \n\n \n5\nabout these mistakes and is actively more diligent about monitoring his checking account \nbalance. (Tr. 56-58.) \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts were incurred prior to Applicant\u2019s current employment, \nwhich began in October 2016. (GX 4.) Applicant lives within his means, has not incurred \nany recent delinquent debts, and is able to maintain his ongoing financial obligations as \nwell as unusual expenses such as uniforms or other costs associated with his son\u2019s \nextracurricular activities. (Tr. 73.) Applicant is also paying $100 a month for a $2,000 \njudgment for past-due homeowner\u2019s association dues. When Applicant purchased his \nhome, the seller did not disclose the requirement of homeowner\u2019s association dues, and \nit was several years before Applicant was aware of the requirement. (Tr. 24-25; Tr. 60-\n61.) Applicant works part time as a pastor and receives a biweekly donation of \napproximately $200. He also sporadically earns about $100 a week when working for a \nfriend with a lawn-care service. (Tr. 66-68.) Applicant intends to resolve his remaining \ndelinquent accounts. He was sincere and credible while testifying. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n \n6\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n7\n \nThe record evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(d): deceptive or illegal financial practices such as . . . check fraud. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past financial problems were attributable to matters largely beyond his \ncontrol. Specifically, he experienced a sustained period of underemployment and three \nperiods of unemployment that resulted in his inability to maintain his financial obligations. \nInitially, Applicant acted responsibly by reorganizing his debts through Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, into which he paid $1,500 a month between 2009 and 2013, until he could \nno longer afford the payments because he was unemployed. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s wife \nand son both have chronic medical conditions that require frequent medical treatment. \nBecause Applicant could not afford insurance while unemployed, he incurred substantial \nmedical debt. It is significant that all of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts were incurred prior to \nstarting his current employment in 2016 and that more than half of the delinquent \naccounts are medical debts. Applicant has not incurred any delinquent debts since \ngaining his current employment and health insurance coverage. \n \n \nAfter the manufacturing plant closed in 2003, Applicant invested in his future by \nearning a bachelor\u2019s degree and taking coursework towards a master\u2019s degree. Since he \ngained more lucrative employment, Applicant has begun addressing his delinquent \naccounts within his means. He engaged the services of a credit-repair firm to assist him \n\n \n8\nin resolving his past-due debts, and has paid had four debts and has had four debts \nsuccessfully removed from his CBR. He has contacted a number of his creditors on his \nown with the intention of establishing repayment plans. He entered and satisfied a six-\nmonth repayment plan with his mortgage-loan creditor and has resolved the $9,376 \narrearage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.hh.  The creditor for the $10,201 delinquent vehicle-lease \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.w) forgave the debt and Applicant properly filed the IRS 1099-C and paid \nthe appropriate taxes. He has paid over $15,000 through garnishment on the $16,367 \njudgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ee. Although this debt is being resolved through \ngarnishment, the fact that a debt is paid through garnishment does not bar mitigation of \nfinancial concerns. ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep 26, 2006). Applicant \nis also voluntarily paying a $2,000 non-SOR judgment. \n \n \nApplicant is working with a credit-repair firm to pay or dispute several of his \nremaining delinquent accounts and has resolved five SOR debts through its services. He \nwill pay the remaining delinquent accounts as soon as he is able. Applicant initially acted \nin good faith by filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy and maintaining his payments for nearly four \nyears. After incurring delinquent debt due to circumstances largely beyond his control, he \nhas continued to act in good faith by contacting his creditors, engaging a credit-repair firm \nand paying or successfully disputing a number of debts, rehabilitating his mortgage-loan, \nand otherwise addressing his delinquent debts. He also works part-time as a pastor and \nlawn-service worker to earn additional income.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \n \nApplicant has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2016 and is working to \nresolve those accounts which remain outstanding. Applicant now maintains health \ninsurance. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies were not due to frivolous or irresponsible \nspending. Although Applicant experienced past financial issues, he established and \ninstituted a plan to pay or otherwise resolve his delinquent debts, and lives within his \nmeans. Although Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, he has made a good-faith effort to \nrepay or successfully dispute his debts and has established a plan to resolve his financial \nissues within his means. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply.  \n \n \nOn three occasions between 1990 and 2014, Applicant unintentionally issued \nworthless checks. He made restitution and paid the requisite court costs. He is remorseful \nabout these mistakes and has instituted safeguards to prevent it from happening again. \nThe last instance of issuing a worthless check occurred nearly five years ago. This \n\n \n9\nconduct is was infrequent and occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on Applicant=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-person concept, \nan administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by \nconsidering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2, but have also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant invested in his future by graduating from college and working towards a \ngraduate degree. That investment resulted in more stable and lucrative employment. \nWhile Applicant and his wife have experienced some tax-related delinquencies in the \npast, they initially worked with the IRS and entered a repayment plan. That plan has since \nbeen suspended by the IRS and Applicant does not owe a balance on his tax account. \nApplicant is active in his community as a part-time pastor, and periodically works an \nadditional part-time job to help with the household finances.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his financial circumstances. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.rr:  \n \n \nFor Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 45 years old and married, with two children. He earned a GED in July 1991, and a certificate from a technical/trade school in February 2002. He has held his present employment with a defense contractor since February 2002, and is seeking to continue the security clearance he has held since 2005 in connection with that position. He has no military service or Federal Government employment. (Item 3.) Applicant admitted owing delinquent Federal income taxes for each year from 2012 through 2016, totaling $27,578, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. (Item 2.) The amounts due were based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts that he obtained on June 5, 2017, and submitted 14 days later in his response to DOHA interrogatories. (Item 4.) These delinquent taxes remain largely unpaid and outstanding according to all record evidence. Applicant entered into several short-lived installment/repayment agreements with the IRS concerning these taxes, which ended after his attempted payments were dishonored. He attributed his initial tax problems to an audit of his 2012 and 2013 tax returns, on which he had claimed and received substantial refunds, but actually owed a combined $12,658 in unpaid taxes. He blamed subsequent deficiencies on under-withholding and his family\u2019s routine spending in excess of available income. The five IRS account transcripts for 2012 through 2016 report total family joint adjusted gross income (AGI) of $701,395 over that ",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n01/04/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, that became effective for all Executive Branch \nagencies on June 8, 2017.1 \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 25, 2017, and requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.) On \nSeptember 5, 2017, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing eight Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on September 7, 2017, and received by him on September 18, \n2017. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of \nthe FORM. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney submitted five documents in response to the \nFORM, on Applicant\u2019s behalf, with an explanatory cover letter dated October 7, 2017. \nThis submission is marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, and Department Counsel had no \nobjection to its admissibility. Applicant did not submit any other response to the FORM, \ndid not file any objection to its contents, and did not request additional time to respond \nbeyond the 30-day period. AE A and Items 1 through 8 are admitted in evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old and married, with two children. He earned a GED in \nJuly 1991, and a certificate from a technical/trade school in February 2002. He has held \nhis present employment with a defense contractor since February 2002, and is seeking \nto continue the security clearance he has held since 2005 in connection with that \nposition. He has no military service or Federal Government employment. (Item 3.)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing delinquent Federal income taxes for each year from \n2012 through 2016, totaling $27,578, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. (Item 2.) \nThe amounts due were based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts \nthat he obtained on June 5, 2017, and submitted 14 days later in his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories. (Item 4.) These delinquent taxes remain largely unpaid and outstanding \naccording to all record evidence. Applicant entered into several short-lived \ninstallment/repayment agreements with the IRS concerning these taxes, which ended \nafter his attempted payments were dishonored. He attributed his initial tax problems to \nan audit of his 2012 and 2013 tax returns, on which he had claimed and received \nsubstantial refunds, but actually owed a combined $12,658 in unpaid taxes. He blamed \nsubsequent deficiencies on under-withholding and his family\u2019s routine spending in \nexcess of available income. The five IRS account transcripts for 2012 through 2016 \nreport total family joint adjusted gross income (AGI) of $701,395 over that period, for an \naverage annual AGI of $140,279. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5.) \n                                                 \n1 These guidelines were promulgated in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for use when rendering any final national \nsecurity eligibility determination. SEAD 4 \u00b6 D.7 defines \u201cNational Security Eligibility\u201d as, \u201cEligibility for \naccess to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, to include access to sensitive \ncompartmented information, restricted data, and controlled or special access program information.\u201d \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n   \nApplicant also admitted owing $4,540 in delinquent state income taxes for 2012, \n2013, and 2015, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.h, and that the state had entered a \ntax lien against him in May 2016 in the amount of $5,890. He made several payments \ntoward these state taxes under an installment plan, and provided a letter from the state \ncomptroller, dated June 5, 2017, reflecting that $4,540 remained unpaid as of that date. \nApplicant did not submit evidence of any additional payments toward his Federal or \nstate income tax debts in his October 2017 response to the FORM. (Item 2; Item 4; Item \n5; Item 7; Item 8.) \n  \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.j, that his home mortgage, with a \ntotal loan balance of $288,895, was past due in the approximate amount of $65,697.  \nThese figures were based on, and are documented by, Applicant\u2019s May 19, 2017 credit \nreport. Applicant and his wife opened this loan for $295,923 in November 2007, with \nscheduled \nmonthly \npayments \nof \n$1,984. \nThis \nwas \nan \nFHA-guaranteed \nrefinancing/equity-withdrawal loan to replace the $220,000 and $55,000 conventional \nfirst and second mortgages with which they had purchased their home in December \n2005. The first reported delinquency on the current loan payments was in July 2014, \nand the reported past-due amount comprises the succeeding 33 months of failure to \npay. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 6.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney filed a Chapter 13 petition for Applicant and his \nwife on July 12, 2017. The attorney explained: \n \nThe filing was prompted, in part, by the Debtors\u2019 inability to negotiate a \n\u201cshort sale\u201d with the lienholders on their former residence located at \n[address]. The purpose of the case is to manage debts resulting from the \nsurrender of that property and otherwise. \n \nHe reported that the five-year Chapter 13 plan had been confirmed on October 2, 2017; \nand that Applicant and his wife had been excellent clients who \u201chave every intention of \ncompleting their plan in the time allotted.\u201d Their first two $936 monthly payments were \nmade to the trustee in August and September 2017. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant did not document any financial counseling. He did not submit the \nincome and expense schedules from his bankruptcy filing, or any other budgetary \ninformation, from which to analyze his future ability to comply with the bankruptcy plan \nwhile meeting family living expenses and repaying his income tax delinquencies. \nApplicant offered no evidence concerning the level of responsibility his duties entail in \nhis defense contractor work, or his track record with respect to handling sensitive \ninformation and observation of security procedures. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing.  \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes five conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant incurred more than $32,000 in delinquent Federal and state income tax \ndebt since 2012, and about $66,000 in mortgage debt through failure to make required \npayments since July 2014. His home was foreclosed and will be surrendered to the \nlienholder under his recent bankruptcy plan. He provided insufficient financial \ninformation to clarify whether this financial irresponsibility stemmed from inability or \nunwillingness to pay these important financial obligations, despite earning over \n$700,000 during those five years. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the \nresulting security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt over the past six years is substantial, and \nhis financial irresponsibility is ongoing. His failure to demonstrate substantial progress \ntoward resolution of any of the SOR-alleged tax and mortgage debts in a meaningful \nway creates ongoing concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. He \noffered no reasonable basis to conclude that such problems will not continue or recur. \nMitigation was not established under AG \u00b6 20(a). \n  \nApplicant neither claimed that his debts arose from circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, nor showed that he acted responsibly under such circumstances, as required \nfor mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). He offered no evidence of effective financial counseling \nor budget information establishing solvency going forward, and admitted his inability to \nrepay his current delinquencies. He failed to demonstrate that these problems, in \naggregate, are being brought under control; or that a good-faith effort toward resolution \nhas actually been followed through upon for a meaningful period. This specifically \nincludes his failure to comply with several short-lived Federal and state income tax \nrepayment agreements, and insufficient evidence of payments under his most recent \nagreements if they survived his bankruptcy plan. Accordingly, Applicant did not \nestablish mitigation of financial security concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \n20(d), or 20(g). \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, \nwho is accountable for his choices. He continues to owe more than $32,000 in \ndelinquent income tax debt, and recently undertook a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan \nrequiring large monthly payments that he has no meaningful track record of being able \nto make. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished, and \nrehabilitation was not demonstrated. Overall, the evidence creates significant doubt as \nto Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He \nfailed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the Financial \nConsiderations guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a \nsensitive position is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nDAVID M.

Driskill, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Skyler Samp, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) on December 15, 2010, \nand February 24, 2016. On August 10, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline E, (Personal \nConduct). Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) on October 9, 2017, and requested a \ndecision on the record without a hearing. On December 21, 2017, a complete copy of the \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was mailed to Applicant.1 He \nreceived the FORM on December 27, 2017. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. On February 14, 2018, Applicant submitted a \nsupplemental Answer to the SOR and FORM, which I labeled Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \nThere were no objections to Items 1 through 6 or AE A, and they are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on May 7, 2018. \n1 The SOR and Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR were submitted by Department Counsel as Item 1. I labeled \nhis response as \u201cAnswer\u201d. \n04/03/2019\n\n \n \n2 \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He has been married since August 2015 and has no \nchildren. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. He has worked as a federal contractor \nsince September 2005 and has held a security clearance since approximately 2006 or \n2007.2 Applicant has worked for his current employer, as a system software engineer, \nsince October 2015. (Item 2)  \n \n \nBetween March 2000 and January 2014, Applicant was arrested or charged eight \ntimes with various crimes or infractions. He was charged with alcohol-related offenses \nfive times. He was also charged with a felony-level destruction of property offense, \nreckless driving, and driving without a license. He purchased drugs in 2010, while holding \na security clearance, and he used marijuana in 2014, while holding a clearance. \nAdditionally, Applicant falsified his February 2016 SCA regarding his criminal history and \ndrug use. In his initial Answer to the SOR that described these facts, Applicant denied all \nof the allegations, with explanation. (Item 1, Answer) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d allege that Applicant was charged with public intoxication \nfour times between March 2000 and December 2002, while he was in college. He was \ninvolved in a bar fight during one of those incidents. Applicant disclosed the September \n2000 and October 2002 incidents during his March 2010 personal subject interview (PSI). \nDuring that interview, he claimed he had no other alcohol-related incidents or arrests, \nwhich was untrue.3 Applicant disclosed all four arrests in his December 2010 SCA, but in \nhis February 2016 SCA, he did not disclose the December 2002 incident.4 In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted the underlying conduct, but denied the allegations. He argued that all \nof these SOR allegations should have been alleged under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption) or Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item 1, Answer at 4-7; Item 2 at 54-56; \nItem 3 at 6-7, 13, 22-23; Item 4 at 53-55) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged that, in February 2006, Applicant was charged with driving \nwithout a license, driving without registration, and driving on a suspended license. At the \ntime of the arrest, his license was suspended because he had several outstanding parking \ntickets and he did not have the funds to register his vehicle. He was found guilty and spent \nthree days in jail. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation, but admitted the \nunderlying conduct. (Item 1, Answer at 7-8; Item 3 at 5-6, 13, 21; Item 4 at 53) \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged that Applicant was arrested and charged with felony-level \ndestruction of property in July 2009. He claimed that early in the morning, after he left a \nclub, he was assaulted by a group of young men. His girlfriend, who was with him, called \n                                                          \n2 Applicant was briefly unemployed between July 2010 and October 2010. \n \n3 Because Applicant\u2019s failure to tell the truth to the investigator was not alleged in the SOR, I will only \nconsider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person factors. \n \n4 Because Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the December 2002 incident in his SCA was not alleged in the \nSOR, I will only consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person \nfactors. \n\n \n \n3 \nthe police, and they gave statements. After the police left the scene, the men returned, \nand Applicant broke the window of their vehicle. He was subsequently arrested, but the \ncharges were dismissed by a judge the next day. Applicant disclosed this arrest in his \nFebruary 2016 SCA. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation, and the underlying \ncriminal conduct. Additionally, he argued that the incident should have been alleged under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item 1, Answer at 8; Item 2 at 52-53; Item 3 at 4-5, 13, \n22; Item 4 at 52-53; Item 6 at 4) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged that, in September 2010, Applicant purchased cocaine in the \nform of a \u201cThai stick\u201d. He was not employed at this time, but he still held a security \nclearance. He disclosed information regarding this incident in his December 2010 SCA, \nand during his 2011 PSI, and 2017 PSI. While Applicant was in Las Vegas with his \ngirlfriend on vacation, they attempted to identify drug users on the street by the way \npeople appeared, and they decided to see if they could purchase drugs from a stranger. \nApplicant asked the strangest person he saw if he could purchase cocaine from him. \nWhen the person said yes, Applicant claimed he told the individual that he was just joking, \nbecause he did not really intend to purchase drugs. However, according to Applicant, the \nindividual made Applicant go to an ATM and withdraw money for the cocaine. After the \nsale was completed, Applicant claimed he destroyed the cocaine and did not use it. In his \nAnswer, Applicant admitted the underlying conduct, but claimed he was coerced into the \npurchase. Additionally, he claimed that this incident occurred in September 2012, which \nis inconsistent with his disclosures in his 2010 SCA and 2011 PSI. Applicant asserted \nthat this allegation should have been alleged under Guideline H (Drug Involvement or \nSubstance Abuse) (Item 1, Answer at 8-9; Item 2 at 57-59; Item 3 at 14, 24, 28) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleged that, in June 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndriving while intoxicated, first offense; driving under the influence (DUI); and operating \nwhile impaired. He did not disclose this arrest in his 2016 SCA. During his February 2017 \nPSI, the investigator confronted Applicant regarding his arrest history twice, before he \nquestioned Applicant about this arrest.5 Applicant told the investigator that after leaving a \nbar, he ran a red light, and was pulled over by law enforcement. According to Applicant, \nhe passed the field sobriety test, but was arrested and taken to the police station. He \nclaimed he never heard anything from the arresting agency after the arrest. Applicant told \nthe investigator that he thought the incident was outside the reporting period. Additionally, \nhe stated he was unaware that he was charged with an offense or that the arrest would \nbe on his record. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation, because he claimed he \npassed the field sobriety tests. (Item 1, Answer at 9-10; Item 3 at 28; Item 6 at 4-5) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleged that, in November 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith reckless driving. He pled guilty to this charge in March 2014, and was ordered to pay \na $500 fine and costs. Applicant did not disclose this arrest in his 2016 SCA, or during \n                                                          \n5 Because Applicant\u2019s failure to be truthful and forthcoming with the investigator was not alleged in the SOR, \nI will only consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person factors. \n \n\n \n \n4 \nthe January 2017 PSI or February 2017 PSI.6 In his Answer to the SOR, he denied the \nallegation, and claimed the arresting officer did not use a radar gun; therefore, there was \nno evidence that his speeding rose to the level of reckless driving. He asserted that the \nunderlying conduct should have been alleged under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). (Item \n1, Answer at 9-10; Item 3; Item 5 at 1) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleged that Applicant used marijuana, multiple times during the summer \nof 2014, while holding a security clearance. He told the government investigator that he \nused marijuana with his siblings and their spouses. In his Answer, he denied the allegation \nbecause he believed the underlying conduct should have been alleged under Guideline \nH (Drug Involvement or Substance Misuse). Additionally, he claimed he no longer uses \nmarijuana. (Item 3 at 23-24) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through 1.m alleged that in his February 2016 SCA, Applicant failed to \ndisclose the June 2012 DUI arrest, the January 2014 reckless driving arrest, and his 2014 \nuse of marijuana. During his February 2017 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he \ndid not disclose his 2014 marijuana use in his February 2016 SCA because he forgot that \nhe used marijuana in 2014. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegations, because he \nclaimed he was \u201crushing when he completed the form.\u201d (Item 3 at 28) \n \nIn his supplemental Answer to the SOR and FORM, Applicant claimed he did not \ndisclose the June 2012 DUI arrest and 2014 drug use in his 2016 PSA because he \nmisunderstood the term, \u201ccharged and convicted,\u201d which does not appear in the question \nto which he falsely responded. He also claimed he did not disclose the 2014 reckless \ndriving arrest because he did not know he was fined more than $300. (AE A) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s March 2010 PSI, Applicant discussed his earlier disclosure of \ndrug use that included use of marijuana approximately three times in October 2000, \nmushrooms two times in April 2001, and ecstasy twice in October 2001. Applicant told \nthe investigator that he did not intend to try or experiment with drugs ever again. During \nhis March 2011 PSI, Applicant reaffirmed the extent of his previous drug use, and claimed \nthat he did not intend to ever use drugs again.7 (Item 3 at 8-9, 14-15) \n \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant was confronted by an investigator regarding the full \nextent of his drug history. He admitted he used marijuana three times between 1995 and \n2003; he used mushrooms six times between March 2000 and March 2004; he used \necstasy five times between October 2001 and March 2003; and he used cocaine once in \n2000.8 (Item 3 at 23-24) \n                                                          \n6 Because Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose this arrest to the investigator was not alleged in the SOR, I will only \nconsider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person factors. \n \n7 Because Applicant\u2019s failure to be truthful regarding his drug use during his PSIs was not alleged in the \nSOR, I will only consider this information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person \nfactors. \n \n8 Because Applicant\u2019s involvement with drugs prior to 2010 was not alleged in the SOR, I will only consider \nthis information as a factor in evaluating credibility, mitigation, and whole\u2013person factors. \n\n \n \n5 \n \nApplicant submitted three employment-related awards and an October 2017 \ncertificate that he completed a drug and alcohol course. He also submitted two letters of \nrecommendation. There is no evidence as to whether Applicant disclosed his 2014 arrest \nand 2014 drug use to his facility security officer or company. (Item 1, Answer at 19, 20, \n22-25) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d9 As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the authority to \u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d10 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d11 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAdverse clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d12 Thus, \na decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing national security eligibility. \n \n                                                          \n \n9 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n10 Egan at 527. \n \n11 EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n12 EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.13 \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than \na scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d14 The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability.15 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nalleged facts.16 An applicant has the burden of proving a potential mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.17 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d18 \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d19 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern under Guideline E is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n                                                          \n13 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n14 See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n15 ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \n16 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n17 ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n18 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n19 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; See also AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n \n7 \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nApplicant intentionally failed to disclose adverse criminal information and drug use \nin his February 2016 SCA. He was either ticketed or arrested eight times between 2000 \nand 2014. He used drugs on more than one occasion while holding a security clearance. \nHis history of misconduct, when considered as a whole, raises serious security concerns \nand demonstrates his questionable judgment, lack of candor, and unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(c) are established.20 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstance that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressor, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nApplicant did not disclose two arrests, or his use of marijuana, while holding a \nclearance, in his February 2016 SCA. Additionally, he did not disclose the full extent of \nhis criminal history and drug use until he was confronted multiple times by investigators \nin 2017. Applicant did not demonstrate a prompt or good-faith effort to correct his \nomissions, concealment, or falsifications before he was confronted with the facts. There \nis insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG  \u00b6 17(a). \n \n                                                          \n20 Applicant denied the allegations alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j on the basis \nthat they should have been alleged under different guidelines. Based on the evidence, including the history \nand the pattern of Applicant\u2019s offenses, evaluating these security concerns under Guideline E is \nappropriate. \n\n \n \n8 \nApplicant asserted, in his February 2017 PSI, Answer, and supplemental Answer, \nthat he did not intentionally falsify his 2016 SCA. He claimed that he forgot about his \narrests and his drug use, even though the incidents occurred only two years before he \ncompleted his most recent SCA. Applicant was an educated and experienced \nprofessional when he completed the 2016 SCA. This was not his first security clearance \napplication, having completed one in 2010, and another prior to 2010. The evidence as a \nwhole reflects that he was aware of his arrest history and drug use when he completed \nhis most recent SCA. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent explanations for failing to disclose adverse \ninformation lack credibility, and do not alleviate concerns as to his trustworthiness, \njudgment, candor, integrity, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. His \nfailure to disclose requested information is serious, as is his pattern of misconduct over \nthe years. There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG  \u00b6 17(c). \n \nApplicant attended an eight hour drug and alcohol educational class in October \n2017, shortly after the SOR was issued. This provides minimal mitigation, due to the \ntiming of the counseling and the fact that Applicant used drugs while holding a clearance, \nand when he was in his mid-thirties. The evidence does not establish persuasive \nmitigation under AG  \u00b6 17(d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant is an educated and experienced professional, as evidenced by his letter \nof recommendation and performance awards. His lengthy history of questionable \njudgment, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and lack of candor when \ncompleting government forms and during government interviews, leaves me with doubt \nas to his ability to protect classified and sensitive information. He concealed derogatory \ninformation multiple times from the government, and his varied and inconsistent \nexplanations lack credibility. \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \nMany of the allegations are related to behavior that occurred when Applicant was \nyoung and immature. However, the criminal behavior continued until four or five years \nago, and Applicant made false statements to investigators as recently as two years ago. \nHis behavior established a lengthy pattern of rule violations, and a failure to cooperate or \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns at issue. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of the United States to grant him national security \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. National \nsecurity eligibility is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nerney, Esq.   \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. An Iranian citizen by birth and a U.S. citizen since \n2008, Applicant met his burden to present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern for foreign influence due to his minimal ties \nto Iran. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on November 3, 2015.1 This document is commonly known as \na security clearance application. After a background investigation, he was granted a \nsecurity clearance at the secret level, which his employer (via the Government \ncustomer) subsequently requested be upgraded to top secret.2 Thereafter, on March 6, \n1 Exhibit 1. \n2 Tr. 5. \n03/22/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, \nMaryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find \nthat it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual \nreasons for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline B for foreign \ninfluence due to his ties to Iran, the country of his birth.  \n \nWith assistance of counsel, Applicant answered the SOR on May 2, 2018. His \nanswers to the SOR allegations were mixed with explanations, and he provided \nsupporting documentation (marked as Exhibits A-N). He also requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place \nas scheduled on December 4, 2018. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Government Exhibits 1-5 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A-W.3 I took administrative or official notice, which is similar to judicial notice, of \ncertain facts concerning the country of Iran per Department Counsel\u2019s written request.4 \nThe essential facts about Iran are discussed below. The hearing transcript was received \non December 12, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, a native of Iran, is a 36-year-old employee who is seeking to upgrade \nan existing security clearance to the top-secret level for his job as a senior systems \nengineer for a company in the defense industry. He has never married and has no \nchildren. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 2003. He, along with his \nfather, mother, and sister, became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2008,5 and they all reside \nin the United States.  \n \nShortly after his arrival here, Applicant attended a local community college and \nthen a large state university during 2004-2006, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering. He was a graduate student at a private research university for \none semester in 2008 before he was admitted to a prestigious private research \nuniversity. He earned a master\u2019s degree in aeronautics and astronautics in June 2012. \nHe remained a student at the same university while on leave of absence from \nSeptember 2012 to August 2013.  \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer since late 2014. Before that, he \nhad a series of part-time jobs. He was self-employed as a research associate during \n2012-2014. He was self-employed as information technology specialist during 2013-\n2014. He was employed as a research assistant for the university during 2010-2012 \n                                                          \n3 Tr. 12-18. \n \n4 Exhibit 5.  \n \n5 Exhibits I, J, K and L.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwhile studying for his master\u2019s degree. Before that, he worked as an associate software \nengineer for a well-known research and development center during 2007-2008. This \nwas his first job after earning his bachelor\u2019s degree.   \n \nWith exception of an unnamed friend, the SOR concerns Applicant\u2019s family ties to \nIran via his father, mother, sister, aunt, and uncle, whom all have dual citizenship with \nthe United States and Iran. The relevant details are set forth below. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, age 63, a child psychologist with a master\u2019s degree from a \nU.S. university, was a kindergarten teacher or principal for a few years in Iran until the \nbirth of her second child. She has permanently resided in the United States since \nmoving here in 2003. She traveled to Iran periodically (e.g., once per year) to provide \ncare for her mother until her death after a long period of illness in 2011 or 2012. Since \nthe passing of her mother, Applicant\u2019s mother made three short trips to Iran to assist \nwith the shipping of household property to the United States.6 Applicant\u2019s mother is not \nemployed outside the home, and she has focused her time and energy throughout her \nmarriage on running the household and raising the children. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, age 69, has spent a career in academia, with teaching \npositions at the university level in both Iran and the United States. He earned his \ndegrees, including a Ph.D., from universities in the United States.7 He then worked for \nvarious companies in the United States. When they married, his wife was then a student \nat a U.S. university. After the revolution in Iran, Applicant\u2019s father and mother decided to \nreturn to Iran so she could be near her mother. They resided there from the early 1980s \n(Applicant was born in Iran in 1983) until they returned to the United States in 2003. In \nIran, Applicant\u2019s father worked as a professor of civil engineering at a technology \nuniversity and as a senior executive for the university. He never worked for the Iranian \ngovernment.8 He officially retired from the Iranian university in 2013 or 2014.9 Applicant \nunderstands his father is not entitled to receive a pension or other type of retirement \nbenefit. Applicant\u2019s father has worked for the last several years as a research professor \nfor the same state university where Applicant obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree. Before \nthat, he worked as an adjunct professor for the same university. Since retiring from the \nIranian university, Applicant\u2019s father has made two short trips to Iran in his capacity \nrepresenting the state university.10 Neither Applicant\u2019s father not mother intends to \nreturn to Iran.11  \n \n                                                          \n6 Exhibit N.  \n \n7 Tr. 89.  \n \n8 Exhibit N.  \n \n9 Exhibit N.  \n \n10 Exhibit N.  \n \n11 Exhibit N.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, age 32, recently earned a Ph.D. and she is now a research \nassistant in a post-doctoral program with the federal government.12 She traveled to Iran \non a single occasion in 2009 to visit her grandmother.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt (his mother\u2019s sister) and uncle are dual citizens who reside in \nthe United States. They have a son born in Iran and a daughter born in the United \nStates. Both of Applicant\u2019s cousins are U.S. citizens. Applicant has limited contact with \nhis aunt and uncle due to geographic separation. He knows that his aunt has always \nbeen a stay-at-home mother, and his uncle has a Ph.D. in civil engineering. As far as \nApplicant knows, neither his aunt nor his uncle have any connections to the Iranian \ngovernment.  \n \nApplicant believes the unnamed friend, alleged in the SOR to be a citizen of Iran, \nis a person with whom he had irregular social interactions with but none since 2015.13 \nApplicant was introduced to the person by a professor they had in common. The social \ninteractions consisted of hanging out, watching football, and having a beer or two.14  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests are solely in the United States.15 His annual salary \nis about $100,000, and he has a net worth of about $250,000, which is sizeable given \nhis age and work history. He volunteers in various constructive community activities.16 \n \nBased on documentary evidence and the testimony of two character witnesses, \nApplicant has a good employment record and is held in high regard. For example, the \ntechnical director of the program in which Applicant works described Applicant as hard \nworking, exceptional, and a high performer in the company.17 He further described \nApplicant as dedicated, trustworthy, and straightforward in following the rules and \ndealing with security matters.18 Even more impressive was the highly favorable \nendorsement from Applicant\u2019s program director, a retired Air Force colonel with 25 \nyears of active duty, including multiple combat tours. He described Applicant as one of \nthe company\u2019s top engineers.19 He described Applicant\u2019s work ethic as the very \nhighest.20 He described Applicant\u2019s character as one of unquestioned integrity and \n                                                          \n12 Tr. 70-72.  \n \n13 Tr. 72-74.  \n \n14 To his credit, Department Counsel acknowledged that he could not identify a specific named person \nand further acknowledged that the allegation was \u201cfairly settled.\u201d Tr. 77.  \n \n15 Tr. 85-88; Exhibits C and D.  \n \n16 Exhibit B.  \n \n17 Tr. 22.  \n \n18 Tr. 23.  \n \n19 Tr. 37.  \n \n20 Tr. 37-38.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \ntrustworthiness with a tremendous sense of honesty.21 He has zero reservations in \nvouching for Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. He further \ndescribed Applicant as \u201cthe best young engineer\u201d employed by the company.22 Going \neven further in his praise, he described Applicant as a national resource, among the \nbrightest of his generation, and whose contributions to the defense and security of the \nUnited States are essential.\u201d23 \n \nConcerning the country of Iran, the February 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, then a \nkey U.S. ally, opened a long rift in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United \nStates that continues to today. On November 4, 1979, radical Iranian students seized \nthe U.S. Embassy in Tehran, and then held hostages until shortly after President \nReagan\u2019s inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States severed relations with \nIran on April 7, 1980. As a result, in the United States the Iranian Interests Section is \nlocated in the Embassy of Pakistan, and the U.S. protecting power in Iran is \nSwitzerland. The U.S. Government has a number of special concerns regarding Iranian \nbehavior as outlined in Department Counsel\u2019s written request.24 The concerns include \nIran\u2019s efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction; its support for violent opposition \nto the Middle East peace process; its ongoing support of the Assad regime in war-torn \nSyria; and its dismal human-rights record. The United States has designated Iran as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism for many years.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.25 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.26 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d27 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \n                                                          \n21 Tr. 38.  \n \n22 Tr. 43.  \n \n23 Tr. 46-48; Exhibit A at 3.  \n \n24 Exhibit 5.  \n \n25 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n26 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n27 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n6 \n \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.28 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.29 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.30 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.31 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.32 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.33 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.34 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.35 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Iran should disqualify him from access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,36 the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern \nunder the guideline is: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \n                                                          \n28 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n29 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n30 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n31 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n32 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n33 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n34 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n35 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n36 AG \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, and 8 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.37 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.  \n \n \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of Iran. Suffice it to say, the U.S. \nGovernment views the behavior of the Iranian government as presenting a serious \nnational security concern. Given Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran, a country that is hostile to the \nUnited States, the Government has established its case under Guideline B. In practice, \nthe Iranian government considers dual citizens as Iranian citizens only, and the fact that \nApplicant and his family members obtained U.S. citizenship does not amount to a formal \nor legal renunciation of Iranian citizenship, which is at the discretion of Iranian \ngovernment. Nonetheless, I have given no weight to the evidence concerning the \nunnamed friend in the SOR. At best, the interaction was a casual, social relationship \nthat ended several years ago. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the \nevidence.  \n \n \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n                                                          \n37 AG \u00b6 6.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.  \n \n \nIran\u2019s hostility to the United States and the heightened risk it presents place a \nheavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, Applicant \nhas multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. He was \narticulate, serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. He cooperated fully and provided \ntruthful information about his ties to Iran during the security clearance process. He \nmade a highly favorable impression upon me during the hearing.  \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran, which can now be \ndescribed as minimal. Applicant, then age 20, and his family came to the United States \nin 2003, and he has since established and made his life here. His parents have a long-\nstanding connection to the United States, both having spent years here obtaining their \nacademic degrees before returning to Iran in the early 1980s. Now, Applicant\u2019s father, \nmother, sister, uncle, aunt, and cousins are citizens of and residents in the United \nStates. Applicant has spent the last 16 years living, furthering his education, and \nworking in the United States. His financial interests are solely in the United States. He is \nheld in high regard by many who know him. Indeed, the character evidence, both \ndocumentary and testimonial, was quite powerful.  \n \n \nIt is unclear what has changed since Applicant was favorably adjudicated for a \nsecurity clearance at the secret level within the last few years.38 Nonetheless, Applicant \nhas had more time to establish his ties and connections to the United States and to \ndemonstrate that he adheres to security rules and requirements for his employment with \na defense contractor. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is \nunlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests \nof the United States and the interests of the Iranian government, a terrorist organization, \nor his family members who have Iranian citizenship. I further conclude there is no \nconflict of interest, because Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States that he can be expected to resolve any \npotential conflict of interest in the favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially \napplicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \n                                                          \n38 To his credit, Department Counsel acknowledged in closing argument that he could not honestly say \nwhat had changed since the favorable adjudication.

Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 8, 2017. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOD adjudicators \ncould not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. It recommended \nthat his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether his \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nOn January 22, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 16, \n2019. On February 13, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling the case for \nMarch 7, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Department \nCounsel submitted two documents for admission that I marked as Government Exhibits \n(GEs) 1 and 2. Applicant submitted 13 exhibits, incorporated into the record as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through O. \n \nI took administrative notice, at Department Counsel\u2019s request, of the facts \nencapsulated within seven source documents, identified as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \nthrough HE VII. Also, I incorporated Department Counsel\u2019s corresponding memo and \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s discovery letter to Applicant, as HE VIII and HE IX, respectively. \nThe transcript was received on February 26, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old married man with a 13-year-old daughter.

(HE II at 1) Control of the West Bank is divided, \nper a 1994 agreement, between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. (HE II at 1) In \n2007, Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror organization, violently took over the Gaza Strip, \npart of the territory of the West Bank that the Palestinian Authority had governed.  \n \nThe U.S. State Department advises against travel to the West Bank because of \nthe risk of terrorism, civil unrest, and the potential for armed conflict. (Item III at 1) \nMultiple terrorist groups are present in the West Bank. (HE IV at 2) The Palestinian \nauthority continues to provide \u201cmartyr payments\u201d to the families of Palestinian \nindividuals killed carrying out terrorist acts. (HE V at 3) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n \nThe West Bank has a significant problem with terrorism. The potential for civil \nunrest is pervasive. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s contacts with relatives who live there \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b).  \n \n \nApplicant has been living in the United States for more than 25 years. In that \ntime, he has earned a Ph.D, started a family, and saved more than $1 million. He is a \npillar of his community, and a highly-respected scientist. Given the financial, familial, \ncommunity, and professional roots that he has cultivated during the 27 years he has \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nlived in the United States, I conclude that he would resolve any conflict, generated by \nhis relatives residing in the West Bank, in the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nIn reaching this decision, I was particularly cognizant of Applicant\u2019s stellar \nemployment and character references. \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Berry, Esquire \n05/01/2019 \nDecision \n \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns related to foreign influence raised by his family \nmembers who are citizens and residents of Egypt and his Egyptian property interests. His \nrequest for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \nOn March 10, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86). On \nOctober 30, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on \ninformation available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. Applicant answered the SOR on November 22, 2017, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June \n12, 2018. \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nJuly 13, 2018, scheduling the hearing for August 13, 2018. The hearing was convened as \n\n2 \n \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough R, which were admitted without objection. Applicant also called three character \nwitnesses. The record was left open until September 7, 2018, and Applicant timely \nsubmitted AE S, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 20, 2018. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nThe Government and Applicant both requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Egypt encapsulated in GE 3 and AE R. Those documents provide \nelaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included \nin the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, and not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 49 years old, married (since1997), and has two children, a daughter age \n20 (who attends an American university) and a son age 16 (who is in high school). Applicant \nwas born Egypt and took his bachelor\u2019s degree in Civil Engineering in 1991 from an Egyptian \nuniversity. He arrived in the United States in 2009 and promptly obtained a green card \n(Permanent U. S. Resident). He was naturalized in 2015. Because his children were minors \nliving with him when Applicant was naturalized, they are now U.S. citizens. Applicant took \na Master\u2019s in Business Administration from a U. S. university in 2016. From May 2012 until \nJuly 2016, he worked for a defense contractor. In July 2016, Applicant formed his own \ncompany and is now self-employed. He specializes in construction and project \nmanagement. He continues to do work for his former employer. Applicant has worked on \nfederal government projects, including embassy construction, since 1995. While working for \nhis former employer, Applicant surrendered his Egyptian passport in 2015 or 2016. When \nhe travels, he uses only his U. S. passport.1  \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has family members who are citizens and residents \nof Egypt and that Applicant has property interests in Egypt. More specifically, as to family \nmembers, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s: (1) mother is a citizen and resident of Egypt \nand a retired pharmacist for the department of health; (2) two sisters are citizens and \nresidents of Egypt and that one is a teacher at a technological academy and the other is a \ndiplomat for the Egyptian government; (3) mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Egypt \nand a retired pharmacist for the Ministry of Health ; (4) sister-in-law and brother-in-law are \nphysicians, the former employed by the department of health and the latter retired from the \ndepartment of health.2 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations, upon which \nhe elaborated at the hearing.3 \n                                                          \n1 GE 1; Tr.15-21, 58-59.  \n  \n2 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-g.  \n  \n3 Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-g. \n \n\n3 \n \n  \nAs to property interests in Egypt, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) owns two \napartments; (2) co-owns a home with his mother and two sisters; (3) has bank accounts \nand bank certificates of varying values; (3) has two bank accounts maintained by his \nspouse.4 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations, upon which he elaborated \nat the hearing.5 \n \nApplicant stated in his Answer that when he became a permanent resident in 2009, \nhis long-time goal and passion was to become a U. S. citizen along with his wife and children \nand to serve this nation with honor and dignity. He reiterated those sentiments in his hearing \ntestimony. Applicant wanted his children to live in the United States and be educated here. \nWhen he became a U. S. citizen, he pledged complete, undivided, and unconditional \nallegiance to this country. Applicant could never be manipulated, coerced, or induced to do \nanything that would be against the interests of the United States.6 \n \nIn all of Applicant\u2019s years working on federal government projects (since 1995), he \nhas never had any security violations or any disciplinary issues. If he learned that one or \nmore of his family members in Egypt were being exploited to compromise our national \nsecurity through him, Applicant would report it his Facility Security Officer (FSO) and other \nappropriate authorities. He has been briefed on the appropriate reporting requirements in \nsuch a situation.7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s character witnesses vouched for his exemplary character. The witnesses \neach had personal knowledge of Applicant. They had known him from as far back as 2006, \n2009, and 2012. They each knew the security concerns that prompted this hearing. \nApplicant was described as \u201chonest\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d \u201creliable\u201d with \u201cgreat integrity.\u201d Those \npositive qualities were also expressed in the character letters submitted by Applicant. 8 \n \nApplicant testified about his family members in Egypt. His mother retired as a \npharmacist about 15 or 16 years ago. She is 87. Applicant does not provide any financial \nsupport to his mother. She has no ties to the Egyptian government and was not required to \njoin any political party to work in the department of health. Applicant visits her about once a \nyear. His mother knows nothing about him seeking a security clearance. She only knows \nthat Applicant does construction engineering but not exactly what his job entails. She only \n                                                          \n4 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-p.  \n \n5 Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-p. The SOR also alleged that Applicant\u2019s spouse owned a vehicle in Egypt. SOR \u00b6 1.k. \nApplicant answered that this vehicle was sold in October 2017, which he confirmed in his testimony.

The Academy is a private school. Applicant\u2019s sister \nhas no ties to the Egyptian government or the military.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s other sister has an administrative position with the Egyptian consulate in \nBahrain. It is not a political appointment but is a civil service position. His sisters know \nnothing about him seeking a security clearance. They only know that Applicant does \nconstruction engineering but not exactly what his job entails. They only know that at some \npoint Applicant was working on an embassy project. He speaks to them about every two to \nfour weeks. Applicant sees them when he visits his mother about once every year.10 \n \nApplicant sees his mother-in-law about once a year, when he visits his mother. His \nmother-in-law has no ties to the Egyptian government or military. She does not know about \nApplicant seeking a security clearance and does not know about his work for the United \nStates government. He speaks to her about every two to three weeks. Applicant has never \ngiven his mother-in-law any financial support.11  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a physician with the Ministry of Health. She specializes in \ninfection control. Her spouse is a retired physician from the Ministry of Health. He has been \nretired for about seven to eight years. Applicant visits his sister-in-law when he visits his \nmother. Other than that he speaks with his sister-in-law about once a month or less. \nApplicant speaks only infrequently to her spouse. Applicant has never provided financial \nsupport to his sister-in-law or her spouse. She and her spouse have no ties to the \ngovernment or the military. They do not know about Applicant\u2019s application for a security \nclearance or the work he does for the United States government.12 \n \nApplicant testified about his real property and financial holdings in Egypt. He owns \ntwo apartments. The first apartment (Apt. 1) was alleged to be worth about $70,000.13 That \nis not currently an accurate evaluation of Apt. 1. Applicant sold that property in July of this \n                                                          \n9 Tr. 22-23, 61-62. \n \n10 Tr. 24-27, 63-65. When forward-deployed, the U. S.

The sale price was $49,000.14 \n \nThe second apartment (Apt. 2) was alleged to be worth about $125,000.15 That is not \ncurrently an accurate evaluation of Apt. 2. Because of the economic situation in Egypt and \nthe depreciation of the Egyptian pound, Applicant estimated that its current value is between \n$60,000 and $70,000. Apt. 2 was a gift from his father (now deceased). Egyptian custom is \nthat the father gives his son the gift of an apartment (if he can afford it). In any event, \nApplicant has not tried to sell Apt. 2, because he wants to keep it as a place to stay when \nhe and his family visit.16 \n \nAlong with his mother and his two sisters, Applicant is a co-owner of a home that was \nalleged to be worth approximately $15,000.17 That is not currently an accurate evaluation. \nBecause of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound and that the home\u2019s roof has collapsed, \nit is now worth about $8,000. Of that value, Applicant\u2019s mother would take the first one-\neighth, Applicant would take half of the remainder, with his sisters sharing the other half of \nthe remainder. That works out to be about $3,500 going to Applicant.18 \n \nApplicant testified about his two bank accounts alleged to have a value of about \n$40,000.19 Applicant testified that he closed those two accounts, one in 2016 and the other \nin 2017.20 \n \nApplicant testified about his bank certificates and savings bonds alleged to be worth \nabout $16,000.21 The value of those instruments have depreciated to less than half that \namount because of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound. They are now worth about \n$6,000. Those instruments are in Egyptian pounds, which makes it very hard to convert to \nU. S. dollars. When economic conditions improve, Applicant intends to close those \naccounts.22 \n \n                                                          \n14 Tr. 29-30, 72-73; AE S.  \n   \n15 SOR \u00b6 1.i.  \n \n16 Tr. 30, 78-79.

Again, because of the \ndepreciation of the Egyptian pound, those certificates are now worth about $7,000 or \n$8,000. Those certificates are in the name of his children.24 \n \nApplicant testified about the two bank accounts his wife maintains in Egypt, one \nalleged to have a value of about $14,000 and the second with a value of about $50,000.25 \nHis wife closed the first account in July of this year. The second account has been devalued \ndue to the depreciation of the Egyptian pound. It is now worth about $23,000 to $27,000.26 \n \nBy my calculation, Applicant\u2019s Egyptian assets alleged in SOR totaled $354,000. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s testimony, either by closing some of those accounts or by virtue of \ncurrency devaluation (or a combination of both), his current Egyptian assets total between \n$149,000 and $163,500.27 Of that amount, $7,000 to $8,000 are gifts (bank certificates) \nfrom his mother-in-law to his two children, which are held in their names, not Applicant\u2019s \nname.28 \n \nApplicant\u2019s average salary is between $180,000 and $190,000 annually, although \nthis year his business has picked up and he might make between $250,000 and $300,000.29 \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a civil engineer for a defense contractor, and she makes between \n$140,000 and $150,000 a year including a bonus.30 Applicant has a 401k plan with about \n$37,000 to $38,000 in it.31 He and his wife own their home, which is valued between \n$530,000 and $540,000. They are buying a new home, closing at the end of August this \nyear. It is valued at $950,000.32 Applicant\u2019s combined bank accounts (business and \npersonal) total between $512,000 and $519,000.33 He estimated that his U.S. assets total \n                                                          \n23 SOR \u00b6 1.n. \n \n24 Tr. 34-35.  \n \n25 SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.o and p. \n \n26 Tr. 35-36.  \n \n27 I did not include Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s vehicle, which was sold in 2017.  \n \n28 Applicant has no other assets in Egypt.

If Applicant lost all of his Egyptian assets, he testified credibly that it \nwould not have any impact on him financially.34  \n \nEgypt  \n \nEgypt is a geopolitical partner of the United States, and those two countries have \nhad strong economic and security relationships since 1979. They have worked in tandem \nto combat global terrorism and violent extremism. In 2015, Egypt and the United States \nheld a Strategic Dialogue to strengthen the security cooperation between them.     \n \nThe United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens of threats from terrorist \ngroups in Egypt and to consider the risks of travel to the country. U.S. citizens have been \nkidnapped and murdered by terrorist and extremist groups. Several terrorist groups, \nincluding ISIS, have committed multiple deadly attacks in Egypt, targeting government \nofficials, security forces, public venues, tourist sites, civil aviation and other modes of \npublic transportation, along with diplomatic facilities. U.S. citizens remain at risk as ISIS \nuses kidnapping for ransom to finance their operations. Due to security concerns, U.S. \ndiplomatic personnel are prohibited from travel to parts of Egypt and U.S. citizens are \nwarned to avoid those areas. \n \nExtremist organizations operate in Egypt and ISIS has called on supporters to \nattack U.S. citizens and coalition partners. ISIS media has threatened that places \nassociated with Westerners, Christians, the Egyptian military and police, and Egyptian \ngovernment facilities could be struck at any time. Authorities believe there is continued \nlikelihood of such potential attacks. These terrorist groups use conventional and \nnonconventional weapons to target U.S. Government interests and private interests. \n \nEgypt\u2019s human rights problems involve the excessive use of force by security \nforces, including unlawful killings and torture; and deficiencies in due process, including \nexcessive use of preventive custody and pretrial detention, use of military courts to try \ncivilians, trials of hundreds of defendants in which authorities did not present evidence on \nan individual basis, suppression of civil liberties, including societal and government \nrestrictions on freedom of expression, the press, and peaceful assemble and association. \nThere are also problems with arbitrary arrests; a politically motivated judiciary; restrictions \non academic freedom; impunity for security forces; limits on religious freedom; and \nviolence, harassment, and societal discrimination against women and girls.35 \n \n      \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n                                                          \n34 Tr. 41-43.  \n \n35 AE R; GE 3.  \n\n8 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded \non mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern under the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \u00b6 \n6: \n \n\n9 \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n     \nApplicant has connections to his mother, his two sisters, and his in-laws, who are all \ncitizens and residents of Egypt. There is an articulated heightened risk associated with \nhaving ties to family members in Egypt, due to the activities of terrorist organizations and \ninsurgents operating within its borders. In addition, Applicant had over $350,000 in assets \nin Egypt, between real estate and bank accounts, when the SOR was issued. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located , or the positions or activities of those persons \nin that are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position \n\n10 \n \nof having to  choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f)  the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property                                  \nis such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nI will address Applicant\u2019s Egyptian assets first. When the SOR was issued, Applicant \nhad over $350,000 of assets in Egypt. That was sufficient to raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7(f). Since that time and before the hearing, Applicant liquidated all but approximately \n$163,000 or more. The principal asset remaining is an apartment that was a gift from his \nlate father when Applicant reached manhood (worth about $125,000 today). He intends to \nkeep that to use when he and his family visit their Egyptian relatives. He intends to liquidate \nthe remaining assets when he is able to do so with the banks in question. Those remaining \nEgyptian assets constitute less than 1% of Applicant\u2019s U. S. assets. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies to \nmitigate any security concern.36 \n \nApplicant\u2019s closest connection is, understandably, with his mother, who is 87 years \nold. He communicates with her about weekly and visits her about once per year.37 She does \nnot know that Applicant is applying for a security clearance or that he does work for the \nUnited States government. She does not know specifically what Applicant does for a living, \nonly that he is an engineer. \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his two sisters are far less frequent than those with his \nmother. He speaks with his sisters about every two to three weeks. The same is true with \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law. He speaks with his sister-in-law less frequently, about once per \nmonth. He speaks with her spouse infrequently. Other than Applicant\u2019s sister who works in \nan administrative position with the Egyptian consulate in Bahrain, none these relatives have \nany ties to the government or military. Nor do any of these relatives (including the sister \nworking for the consulate) know that Applicant is seeking a security clearance or the details \nof what his job entails. Applicant has been very assiduous in not providing any details about \nhis work to his Egyptian relatives. I do not find the frequency of Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nhis Egyptian family members sufficient to raise security concerns. They are reasonable \n                                                          \n36 This case is unlike a financial considerations case, where post-SOR remedial efforts are often a sign of bad \nfaith. In fact, Applicant\u2019s efforts to liquidate his Egyptian assets shows prudence and his appreciation of the \nsecurity concerns that ownership of such assets might create.  \n \n37 When Applicant visits his mother, he often also sees his sisters, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law. \n  \n\n11 \n \nmeans to keep in contact with family members who live in a foreign country that is an ally \nof the United States.38 \nThose same contacts, however, need to be evaluated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b). \nApplicant arrived in the United States in 2009 and was granted permanent residency that \nsame year. He applied for citizenship, and it was granted in 2015 (very soon after the \nrequired residency in the U. S.). By that time, Applicant had been working on numerous \nfederal government projects since 1995. He testified credibly that his long-time goal was to \nbecome an American citizen and raise his children here and educate them. Applicant\u2019s \ndream came true in that his daughter is attending a prestigious American university, and \nhis son is in high school here. Applicant and his wife are in the process of buying their \nsecond home and selling the current home. Their first home is currently valued at over \n$500,000. Their new home is valued at $950,000. As noted above, Applicant estimated that \nhis U. S. assets total about $1.7 million. He was described as \u201chonest,\u2019 \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d and \nwith \u201cgreat integrity.\u201d Finally, Applicant testified credibly that if he learned that one or more \nof his Egyptian family members were being exploited to compromise national security \nthrough him, he would report it to his FSO and other appropriate authorities. Applicant has \nestablished himself as a solid United States citizen. I find that it is unlikely that he will be \nplaced in a position to choose between his Egyptian family members and the interests of \nthe United States. In addition, I find that Applicant has such a deep loyalty to the United \nStates that he would resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply.  \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed \nthe evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.39 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n           For Applicant \n \n                                                          \n38 I find nothing troublesome about Applicant\u2019s sister who works in an administrative position at the Egyptian \nconsulate in Bahrain. Bahrain is a nation friendly to the U. S. and hosts the U. S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet.  \n \n39 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \n \n\n12 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. National security eligibility is granted. \n \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Edmunds, Esq.  \n \n07/30/2019 \n____________ \nDecision \n \n______________ \n \n \n \n \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised by her \ncontacts to Iraq and by her prior employment as an administrative assistant at a Saudi \nArabian cultural mission in the United States. Accordingly, this case is decided for \nApplicant.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86 format) on September 23, 2016. This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. On December 18, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), \nexplaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to \n\n2 \n \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for \nthe action under the security guidelines known as Guideline B for foreign influence and \nGuideline C for foreign preference. Applicant answered the SOR on February 15, 2018, \nand requested a hearing.    \n \nThe case was assigned to me on July 20, 2018. After consulting with Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel, a hearing was scheduled for September 7, 2018. The hearing proceeded as \nscheduled. The Government submitted four exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and one Hearing \nExhibit (HE 1), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \n15 exhibits (AE) A through O, which were admitted without objection. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, and without objection, I left the record open until September 17, 2018, to allow \nApplicant to submit additional exhibits. Applicant timely submitted AE P through R, which \nwere admitted without objection. I received the transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and Iraqi-born. She arrived in the United States in \nSeptember 2007 and was naturalized in August 2013. Applicant earned her associate\u2019s \ndegree in Iraq. Applicant was married in 2009 (to a U. S. citizen), had her son in 2010, \nand was divorced in June 2016. Except for the period from April 2014 to December 2016, \nApplicant has worked for defense contractors since May 2003. She continues to be \nemployed by a defense contractor, but she has recently enlisted in the U. S. Navy. (GE \n1; GE 2; AE A; AE P; Tr. 83-84.)    \n \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged that: (1) Applicant\u2019s parents, two brothers, \nand her youngest sister are citizens and residents of Iraq; (2) two of Applicant\u2019s other \nsisters are citizens and residents of Iraq, worked as linguists for U. S. or coalition forces \nin Iraq, and in 2009 they were deemed by U. S. intelligence to be security risks to U. S. \nor coalition forces. Under Guideline C, the SOR alleged that as of April 2014, Applicant \nwas employed by the Cultural Mission of Saudi Arabia. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. and 2.)  \n \nApplicant identified the immediate family members who were subjects of the SOR \nin her April 2015 security clearance application and in her September 2016 security \nclearance application. The frequency of Applicant\u2019s telephone calls with those family \nmembers in 2015 and in 2016 was about the same. Except for one brother employed as \na medical technician by the Iraqi government, those family members have no ties to the \nIraqi government or military. (GE 1, pp. 32-43; GE 2, pp. 24-35.) \n \nApplicant admitted that her mother, her two brothers, and a sister are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq; she also answered that her father was a citizen and resident of Iraq but \nthat he died in October 2017. She admitted that two of her other sisters were citizens and \n                                                          \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. \n \n\n3 \n \nresidents of Iraq and had been linguists, but she denied with explanations that those two \nsisters assisted any anti-coalition forces in Iraq. Applicant answered that in April 2014 she \nwas employed as an administrative assistant with the Cultural Mission of Saudi Arabia \nlocated in the United States, but that employment ended in December 2016. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 \n1. and 2.) \n \nApplicant testified about her service as a linguist for U. S. troops in Iraq. She \nstarted working as a linguist in Iraq at about 18 or 19 years of age. Applicant is fluent in \nArabic and English. Because of force-protection requirements, Applicant had to live and \nwork on base with U.S. troops. She could not leave the base, and her relatives could not \nvisit her on base. She was not allowed to speak with her relatives while working as a \nlinguist. Thus, from 2003 to 2007, she had little contact with her relatives while working \nas a liguist. Although the durations of deployments varied, on average one deployment \nwas about 9 to 11 months straight. She left Iraq after having worked as linguist for U.S. \ntroops in Iraq from 2003 to 2007. Applicant came to the United States on a special \nimmigrant visa and was fast-tracked to naturalization due to her service as a linguist for \nU. S. troops. Applicant\u2019s resume details her six deployments to Iraq as a linguist from May \n2003 to present. Those six deployments add up to more than six years spent in Iraq in \nthe service of U. S. troops and coalition forces. From March 2012 to April 2014, Applicant \nworked for a defense contractor state-side training over 4,000 DOD and Department of \nState employees in Iraqi and Middle Eastern culture. (Tr. 17-20, 42, 75-78; AE A.) She \nwas on deployment to Iraq when she received the SOR and returned to the U.S. to \nprepare for this hearing. (Tr. 43-44.) Since Applicant\u2019s arrival in the United States in \nSeptember 2007, she has maintained her residences in the United States. (GE 1, pp. 12-\n15; GE 2, pp. 9-11.) \n \nApplicant testified about her contacts with her immediate family members. She   \nsaw her siblings that are the subject of the SOR, when Applicant left Iraq in 2007 and \nmore recently in 2008 or 2009. The last time Applicant saw her mother was in 2010 or \n2011, when Applicant and her then husband met her mother in Turkey, so that her mother \ncould meet Applicant\u2019s then new-born son. Before that meeting, Applicant saw her mother \nin 2007 and in 2008 or 2009. (GE 2, p. 42; Tr. 58-59, 78-79.) \n \nWhen Applicant completed her most recent security clearance application \n(September 2016), she was telephoning her mother and her oldest sister daily or every \ntwo or three days. Applicant spoke with her oldest brother and her younger sister about \nmonthly and her youngest brother annually. Applicant\u2019s calls to her mother and siblings \nbecame much less frequent. There are two reasons for that. First, Applicant and her \nmother had a falling out. Applicant believed that her mother delayed an unseemly length \nof time before notifying her that her father had passed away. Applicant missed her father\u2019s \nfuneral. It angered Applicant, and she decided to stop talking to her mother. She has not \nspoken to her mother since her father\u2019s death in October 2017. Second, in December \n2017, she received the SOR and interpreted it to mean that the U. S. Government did not \nwant her to talk to the family members identified in the SOR. Applicant did not want to \njeopardize her job, which she loves, and her life in the United States, which she loves and \nconsiders this country to be her home.  So, she decided to stop communications with her \n\n4 \n \nimmediate family. She has no problem with that. Applicant did not tell her family why she \nstopped communicating with them. Nor did she tell any family members that she was \nseeking a security clearance, and they do not know what she does for a living. (GE 1; Tr. \n24-25, 28-30, 37-38, 51-55, 60-62, 65-67.) \nApplicant testified about her oldest sister and her immediate younger sister who \nthe SOR alleged were deemed by an Army intelligence command in May 2009 to be \nsecurity risks. (GE 3 supports those allegations.) Applicant had no idea about those \nallegations. She hopes they are not true. The first Applicant ever heard of such allegations \nwas when she received the SOR. She was only told by family that one or both of those \nsisters were laid off. (Tr. 30-32, 63-64.) GE 4 reports on an October 27, 2016 \ncounterintelligence screening of Applicant that confirmed that those individuals were her \nsisters. Applicant had disclosed that fact in her \u201cRelatives and Associates\u201d form. As noted, \nApplicant also disclosed that fact in her 2015 and 2016 security clearance applications. \nThe frequency of telephone contacts Applicant had with those two sisters were \napproximately the same in 2015 and 2016. (GE 1, pp. 32-43; GE 2, pp. 24-35.) \n  \n The family member alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is Applicant\u2019s youngest sister. Applicant \nhas not seen her since about 2007. She is about 19 years old and is either a student in \nhigh school or in the first year of college. Applicant and this sister do not talk at all. (Tr. \n32-34.) Applicant explained that when filling out her security clearance applications she \nhad to call her mother, because Applicant did not have first-hand knowledge of her family \nmembers\u2019 ages, marital status, and whether there were any nieces or nephews. (Tr. 80-\n81.) \n \nApplicant testified about her employment by the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission \nfrom April 2014 to December 2016. She was an administrative assistant providing general \nadministrative and clerical support. Applicant said that the Cultural Mission and the Saudi \nArabian Embassy have different missions and have different locations in the United \nStates. Unlike the traditional embassy mission, the Cultural Mission provides assistance \nto Saudi Arabian students who are coming on a scholarship to study in the United States \nfor two years and then return home. Applicant left that job to take her current job with a \ndefense contractor. (Tr. 35-37; AE A.)  \n \nApplicant testified that she has no financial interests, real estate, or bank accounts \nin Iraq. Her mother does not own any land in Iraq. Applicant has no retirement accounts \nin Saudi Arabia. Applicant is not a member of any foreign groups or associations. \nApplicant rents her home here. She has checking and savings accounts in the U.S. \nApplicant also has 401(k) accounts with two former employers here. (Tr. 36-37, 42-47; \nAE M.) She submitted an affidavit stating her willingness to renounce any dual citizenship \nshe may be deemed to have with any foreign country. (AE E.) \n \nApplicant testified about her son, who is nine. He loves baseball and is on a team. \nEven if Applicant does not have her son on a weekend when he has a game, she attends \nanyway to show support. Also, Applicant is teaching him soccer. She has a good working \nrelationship with her ex-spouse about caring for their son. When Applicant is deployed, \nher ex-spouse cares for their son. When Applicant returns, they have joint custody and \n\n5 \n \nshare care-taking responsibilities. Applicant participates in the parent teacher association \nat her son\u2019s school. (Tr. 41-42, 46, 81-83; AE G, I, K, and R.) \n \nApplicant submitted a number of letters of recommendation. Each of the authors \nhad first-hand knowledge of Applicant\u2019s performance in the field as a linguist and cultural \nadvisor. One author is Applicant\u2019s current site manager where Applicant is posted in Iraq. \nHe described her as \u201creliable and trustworthy\u201d with \u201cexcellent and unmatched work ethic\u201d \nwho \u201cperforms her job flawlessly.\u201d Another unit leader who has known Applicant as a \nlinguist in Iraq since October 2017 called her \u201cprofessional and trustworthy.\u201d \n \nAnother one of Applicant\u2019s Iraq site managers wrote that he has worked with over \n300 linguists during his Army career and as a defense contractor in Iraq and that Applicant \nis the \u201cmost loyal, honest, and trustworthy\u201d one that he\u2019s ever worked with. He gave one \nexample. Once in the middle of the night an emergency arose that needed a linguist \nimmediately. He called Applicant who without a question jumped out of bed, handled the \nmission, which took about two hours, and still showed up the next morning to perform her \ndaily duties. (AE B.) \n \nAn officer-in-charge of a unit wrote that Applicant\u2019s \u201cduties have covered a vast \nnumber military subjects and cultural advisory roles.\u201d She \u201chas consistently exceeded \nexpectations.\u201d A Senior Counterintelligence Support Specialist wrote that Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cprofessionalism/expertise is in the top 10% of all the linguists I have worked with in the \nlast 12 years of being in the intelligence field.\u201d (AE J.)  \n \nA Marine Colonel commanding officer of a task force penned a handwritten note \non a Certificate of Appreciation awarded to Applicant for a job well-done as a Linguist, \nTranslator, and Cultural Advisor from March 2017 to August 2017: \u201cThank you for all of \nyour hard work for the S-4 [Logistics], but especially with medical. Your linguistic skills \nare exceptional and we will miss you.\u201d (AE N.)  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq as requested by \nthe Government: Iraq faces many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. \nNumerous terrorist groups and elements hostile to the United States remain active in Iraq. \nIraqi forces, with the assistance of the United States, have seen successes recently and \nmost of the territory previously held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL) has been \nretaken. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high, and the Department of State warns \nU.S. citizens that all but essential travel to Iraq should be avoided. Although the \ngovernment of lraq has made significant progress in its campaign to retake occupied \nterritory from ISIL, there remains a security vacuum in parts of Iraq.  \n \nThe State Department warns that anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten \nU.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and attacks by means \nof improvised explosive devices occur frequently in many areas of the country, including \nBaghdad. Methods of attack have included explosively formed penetrators, magnetic \nIEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed \n\n6 \n \nnear roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such \nattacks often take place in public venues such as cafes and markets. \nThe U.S. government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. \ngovernment personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under \nstrict security guidelines. All U.S. Government employees under the authority of the U.S. \nChief of Mission must follow strict safety and security procedures when traveling outside \nthe Embassy and Consulates.  \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that ISIL \ncommitted the overwhelming number of serious human rights abuses, including attacks \nagainst civilians, especially Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL, members of other \nreligious and ethnic minorities, women, and children. ISIL members committed acts of \nviolence on a mass scale, including killing by suicide bombings, improvised explosive \ndevices, execution-style shootings, public beheadings, and other forms of executions. \nSectarian hostility, widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of \ngovernment and society weakened the Iraqi government's authority and worsened \neffective human rights protections. (HE 1.) \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance. \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, \n994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance).  \n \n As noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly \nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 U.S. at 531. Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and \nthe Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. Directive, \n\u00b6 3.2. An unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any \nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level. \nDirective, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The \nGovernment has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR \nthat have been controverted. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n  \nAn applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven. In addition, an applicant has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. Directive, \nEnclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is \n\n7 \n \nless than a preponderance of evidence. 484 U.S. at 531. The Appeal Board has followed \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-\nevidence standard. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence  \nThe foreign influence security concern is explained at AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAn individual is not automatically disqualified from holding a security clearance \nbecause they have connections and contacts in a foreign country. Instead, in assessing \nan individual\u2019s potential vulnerability to foreign influence, an administrative judge must \ntake into account the foreign government involved; the intelligence-gathering history of \nthat government; the country\u2019s human-rights record; and other pertinent factors. ISCR \nCase No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007) (setting forth factors an administrative \njudge must consider in foreign influence cases).  \n \n \nThe United States and Iraq are allies in the war against ISIL and other terrorists \nand insurgents. The serious security threat posed by these terrorists and other elements \nhostile to the United States must be taken into account in assessing the security concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s relationship to her foreign \nrelatives, coupled with the facts administratively noticed, raise a heightened security \nconcern.  \n \n \nIn assessing the security concern raised by Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and \ninterests, I have considered the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7 and \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8:   \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nAn individual with family members and other connections in a foreign country faces \na high, but not insurmountable, hurdle in mitigating security concerns raised by such \nforeign ties. An applicant is not required, however, \u201cto sever all ties with a foreign country \nbefore he or she can be granted access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-\n13739 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2008). What factor or combination of factors will mitigate \nsecurity concerns raised by an applicant with family members in a foreign country is not \neasily identifiable or quantifiable. ISCR Case No. 11-12202 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2014). \n \nIn the present case, Applicant\u2019s mother, three sisters, and two brothers are \nadmittedly citizens and residents of Iraq. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to \na SOR require no further proof by the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve \nDepartment Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. \nBd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can \nprovide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge\u2019s findings\u201d). Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n(b) apply. The next inquiry is whether the security concern is mitigated. \n \n Applicant signed up as a linguist and a cultural advisor for U.S. and coalition forces \nin Iraq in 2003, when she was about 18 or 19 years of age. The conditions of employment \nwere, that because of force protection measures, Applicant was required to live and work \nalongside of U. S. and coalition troops in Iraq. She was not allowed to communicate in \nany way with her immediate family members in Iraq while she was deployed. On average \nher deployments to Iraq lasted between 9 and 11 months. Between 2003 and the present, \n\n9 \n \nApplicant served six deployments in Iraq for a cumulative six years or more. That is more \ntime than many U. S. active duty service members spend in Iraq.  \n \nIn 2007 Applicant came to the United States and was fast-tracked to naturalization \ndue to her service as a linguist in Iraq. She was naturalized in 2013. By that time, she had \nmarried (in 2009 to a U.S. citizen) and had given birth to her son (in 2010). Applicant \ncontinued to make deployments to Iraq as a linguist, returning to the United States after \neach deployment for a few months. Although her marriage ended in a divorce in June \n2016, the parting was amicable. Her ex-spouse accommodates Applicant\u2019s deployments \nby caring for their son, and sharing childcare duties with Applicant when she returns from \nher deployments to Iraq. When Applicant is back from Iraq she is active in the parent \nteacher association of her son\u2019s school. And she supports and encourages the baseball \nteam he plays for.  \n \nBecause of the restrictions placed on Applicant\u2019s communications with family \nmembers while she is deployed to Iraq, over the past 16 years communications have \nbeen limited to phone calls while Applicant is in the United States in between \ndeployments. Even those communications have been curtailed lately, for two reasons. \nFirst, Applicant and her mother had a falling out in October 2017 when Applicant\u2019s father \ndied. Applicant was angered because her mother did not tell Applicant promptly about his \ndeath. Applicant vowed not to call her mother or other family members. Second, Applicant \ninterpreted the SOR as signaling the Government\u2019s disapproval of such communications. \nThe first reason is a deeply personal and credible one.  A version of the second reason \nwas argued by Department Counsel, comparing Applicant\u2019s curtailment of phone calls to \na Guideline F (financial considerations) case where applicant makes post-SOR payments \nto try to clean up his finances. I respectfully disagree that the analogy is an apt one. The \nargument cuts against the DOHA jurisprudence discussed above, that an applicant need \nnot sever all ties to the foreign country of her birth before being granted a security \nclearance. In fact, Applicant\u2019s decision to cut back on phone calls to her immediate family \nshows her prudence and appreciation of the security concerns that such contacts might \ncreate.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s meetings with family members in Iraq have been rare. She last saw her \nsiblings in 2008 or 2009, about ten years ago. The last time Applicant saw her mother \nwas in 2010 or 2011, when Applicant and her then spouse traveled to Turkey, so her \nmother could meet their then newborn son.   \n \nApplicant has no financial interests, real estate, or bank accounts in Iraq. Her \nmother does not own any land in Iraq. Applicant has no retirement accounts in Saudi \nArabia. She is not a member of any foreign groups or associations. Applicant rents her \nhome here. Since Applicant arrived in the United States in 2007, she has maintained her \nresidences here. She has checking and savings accounts in the U.S. Applicant also has \n401(k) accounts with two former employers here. Applicant\u2019s family members do not know \nwhat she does for a living. Nor do they know that she is seeking a security clearance.  \n \n\n10 \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about two of her sisters who were deemed by an Army \nintelligence command in May 2009 to be security risks was credible. Applicant flatly stated \nthat she had no knowledge about that situation until she received the SOR in December \n2017. She also said that she hoped the allegations were not true but could shed no further \nlight on those allegations. Moreover, that intelligence finding is over a decade old.  \n \nThe letters of recommendation submitted on Applicant\u2019s behalf are uniform in their \nsuperlative praise of her professionalism, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s \nloyalty to the U.S. troops in Iraq has been manifestly shown. Even before Applicant \nbecame a United States citizen in 2013, by that time she had supported U. S. troops in \nIraq for ten years. And she is continuing that support to this day. I find that mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. \n \nGuideline C - Foreign Preference \n \n \nUnder Guideline C for foreign preference, suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt because he or she acts in such a way as to indicate a \npreference for a foreign country over the United States:  \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for \na foreign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, and 11 (setting forth the concern and the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions).) \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 10(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or \npolitical office in a foreign government or military organization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n \n\n11 \n \nAG \u00b6 11(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; \n \nAG \u00b6 11(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign                  \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; and \n \nAG \u00b6 11 (g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or \nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law. \n \nApplicant admitted that from April 2014 until December 2016 she was employed by \nthe Saudi Arabian cultural mission in the United States performing administrative tasks. \nThat period of employment began five years ago and at a time when Applicant had \nbecome a naturalized U. S. citizen. Nevertheless, AG \u00b6 10(d)(1) is sufficiently broad to \nencompass such employment as a potentially disqualifying condition. The next inquiry is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nIraq and the United States have been allies since 2003, when we invaded Iraq to \noverthrow the Hussein government.  That was the same year that Applicant signed up as \na linguist and cultural advisor supporting U. S. and coalition forces. At that time, \nApplicant\u2019s Iraqi citizenship, based on her parents\u2019 citizenship and being born in Iraq, was \napparently not deemed to be in conflict with U. S. national security interests. Applicant\u2019s \nmost evident preference, then and now, was to serve American interests. She has stated \nher intent to renounce any dual citizenship she may have with a foreign country. Finally, \nit is fair to assume that Saudi Arabia\u2019s cultural mission was authorized to employ U. S. \ncitizens, which Applicant was by 2014. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a) through (c), and (g) apply.  \n \n \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq does not raise doubts about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In \nreaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the \nfavorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due \nconsideration to the whole-person concept. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6).) \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n   For Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g:                   For Applicant \n \n\n12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C  \n   For Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:                    \n   For Applicant  \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information. \n  \n \n \nPhilip J.

Applicant is unable to meet her in Pakistan because he is worried about \nhis personal safety. She has never been to the United States. Applicant failed to disclose \nhis marriage to the Pakistani citizen during his September 30, 2013 counterintelligence \ninterview. Foreign influence and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 26, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 28, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

(HE 3) The Government \nrequested a hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 7; file) On April 18, 2018, Department Counsel was \nready to proceed. On April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to another administrative \njudge, and on October 16, 2018, the case was transferred to me. On November 7, 2018, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for January 23, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits, and Applicant \noffered eight exhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 22-29; GE 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-H).  \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of GE 2-6 because there was no authenticating \nwitness for the counterintelligence or security-related investigative documents. (Tr. 23-\n24) I deferred ruling on the admissibility of GE 2-6. (Tr. 25) After voir dire of Applicant \nconcerning the documents, Applicant posed no objection to them, and they were \nadmitted into evidence. (Tr. 85-96) All other proffered exhibits were also admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 25, 29-30, 84) On January 31, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing. The record was held open until February 22, 2019, and Applicant provided two \nadditional documents, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 182-183; AE I; AE J)  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Pakistan and \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 18-19; GE 7-8) Applicant requested administrative notice concerning \nadditional information about the positive relationship between the United States and \nPakistan. (Tr. 12-13; AE A) There were no objections to me taking administrative notice \nof facts concerning these two countries, and all requests for administrative notice were \ngranted. (Tr. 13-14; AE A; GE 7-8) Department Counsel\u2019s request for discovery was also \nadmitted. (Tr. 23; GE 9) \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 \n(3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts \nthat are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, \nSection 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). \nPortions of the administrative notice requests are quoted without quotation marks and \nfootnotes. I have also taken administrative notice of basic facts about the history, \ngeography, population, and diplomatic relationship between the United States and \n\n \n3                                                                                                                                             \nAfghanistan from the U.S. State Department Background Note for Afghanistan (Nov. 28, \n2011), https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/afghanistan/191350.htm. (HE 4) \n  \nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw SOR \u00b6 2.b. (Tr. 10) Applicant concurred \nwith withdrawal of SOR \u00b6 2.b, and I granted the motion. (Tr. 11)  \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e to allege \nthat Applicant\u2019s two stepchildren are citizens and residents of Pakistan (\u00b6 1.d), and \nApplicant had a relationship with an Afghan government official (AGO) (\u00b6 1.e). Applicant \nsaid he was from the same city as AGO, and he met AGO as part of his linguist duties. \n(Tr. 151) He frequently communicated with AGO while he was working as a linguist and \non his own initiative. He denied that AGO was his friend, and he said he has not \ncommunicated with AGO for about one year. (Tr. 151-152) Applicant did not tell AGO \nabout his family that may have been living in Afghanistan. (Tr. 153-154) He did not trust \nAGO with personal information about his family because Applicant was concerned that \nAGO might use pressure or extortion against Applicant. (Tr. 154) Applicant\u2019s counsel \nopposed the motion to amend the SOR, and I denied the motion. (Tr. 145-157) \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed \nfive circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApril 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s relationships with his \nstepchildren living in Pakistan will be considered for the five purposes listed above. His \nrelationship with AGO will not be considered because he has not contacted AGO for at \nleast one year, and this relationship was not sufficiently close to raise a security concern.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. He also provided extenuating and mitigating \ninformation. (HE 3) After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following findings of fact.  \n \n                                            \n1 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant is 51 years old, and he is seeking employment in Afghanistan as a CAT \nII linguist. (Tr. 31) He returned to Afghanistan shortly after his hearing to continue his \nduties as a CAT I linguist (no security clearance) supporting U.S. Forces.  \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan. (Tr. 31) The Russian soldiers occupying \nAfghanistan at that time abused him and his family. (Tr. 34) He received a high school \ndiploma in Afghanistan. (GE 6) He immigrated to the United States in 1995. (Tr. 31) In \n1997, he became a U.S. resident alien. (Tr. 39) He was married to a U.S. citizen from \n1997 to 2000, and he obtained U.S. citizenship through this marriage; however, he said \nhe did not commit immigration fraud. (Tr. 40-41, 88) In 2005, he became a U.S. citizen. \n(GE 1) \n \nFor about 14 years, Applicant worked in the fast-food industry in the United \nStates, and he was promoted to regional director of a large fast-food franchise. (Tr. 38, \n111-11) He believed his employer violated an agreement2 and did not pay him \nsufficiently, and left that employment and became a linguist. (Tr. 38)  \n \nIn 2009, Applicant began working as a linguist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 36) He was \nrepeatedly exposed to combat conditions including small arms fires, indirect weapons \nfires, improvised explosive devices (IED) and rocket-propelled grenades (RPG). (Tr. 42) \nSoldiers were killed in operations in close proximity to him. (Tr. 43) On one occasion his \nvehicle was hit with an IED and turned over. (Tr. 44) Applicant has experienced \nproblems with his sleep and memory, and he attributes his medical problems, in part, to \nhis service in Afghanistan. (Tr. 45) As recently as 2018, he was on patrols that \naccomplished the death of Taliban military personnel. (Tr. 47) \n \nForeign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen and \nresident of Pakistan (\u00b6 1.a); and his mother and brother are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c). \n \nAround 1999, the Taliban killed Applicant\u2019s father. (Tr. 35-36, 59, 138-139) \nAround 2001, the Taliban killed his sister. (Tr. 36, 138-139) Applicant\u2019s mother was a \nhousewife, and he has not heard from his mother since about 1998 or 1999. (Tr. 58, 61, \n146) He does not know if his mother is alive or dead. (Tr. 58) He does not know where \nhis mother lives. (Tr. 59) His brother was a farmer, and his most recent contact with his \nbrother was in 1995. (Tr. 60-61) He does not know where his brother currently resides. \n                                            \n2 The SOR did not allege that Applicant was addicted to gambling, or that he stole about $50,000 \nfrom his fast-food employer. (Tr. 113-123) He said in an interview that in 2013, he was addicted to \ngambling, and he lost about $200,000 gambling. (Tr. 122-126; GE 6) His fast-food employer claimed \n$50,000 was missing, and Applicant was responsible for the loss. (Tr. 114-122; GE 6) Applicant told his \nemployer that his employer could deduct the loss from the $200,000 debt his employer owed him. (Tr. \n114) Applicant said if his girlfriend stole the missing funds, he would take responsibility for the loss. (Tr. \n116) He denied responsibility for the loss of $50,000. (Tr. 157) No adverse inference is drawn against \nApplicant for having a gambling addition or the missing $50,000 because the record of this conduct is not \nsufficiently developed to establish whether he currently has a gambling addiction or that he stole from his \nfast-food employer. \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \n(Tr. 60) His mother and brother did not have any connections, such as employment, with \nthe Afghan government. (Tr. 62)   \n \nIn March 2013, Applicant married his wife, and then she went to Afghanistan and \nmet with Applicant. (Tr. 63, 65, 96, 142) She is 49 years old. (Tr. 140) In 2013, he spent \nabout two weeks with his spouse. (Tr. 65, 96) He most recently met with his spouse in \n2014. (Tr. 65) She resides in Pakistan. (Tr. 76) He communicates with his spouse using \nSkype. (Tr. 66) His spouse has an 8th grade-level education, and she lived with her \nbrother until he died. (Tr. 66) His spouse has two children who are ages 23 and 24, and \nApplicant provides financial support to her, and she uses the funds to support his \nstepchildren. (Tr. 67-68, 143) In 2018, he provided about $6,500 in support to her. (Tr. \n161)  \n \nApplicant applied to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) two or \nthree times in the last several years for his spouse to immigrate to the United States; \nhowever, each time \u201cpictures were lost or something.\u201d (Tr. 98) Applicant acknowledged \nthat he has not provided all of the necessary paperwork to the USCIS for the USCIS to \napprove her residence in the United States; however, he contended that he is close to \nobtaining approval of his spouse\u2019s immigration to the United States. (Tr. 67, 69, 99) For \nexample, he has not completed the required affidavit of support. (Tr. 99-100) For about 9 \nmonths or maybe 18 months, he was focused on his own medical problems and not on \nthe INS\u2019 requirements for his spouse\u2019s immigration. (Tr. 100-103, 141) However, she \nmay have wanted to delay her move to the United States. (Tr. 67, 69) He expects she \nwill move to the United States within one year. (Tr. 68) She has never been to the United \nStates. (Tr. 76) He communicates with her about twice a week. (Tr. 141; GE 5 at 1)  \n \nApplicant could not go to Pakistan to see his spouse because he was well known \nin Pakistan due to his work as a linguist, and \u201cit was very risky for [him] to go there . . . [it] \nwould be very risky for [his] life.\u201d (Tr. 141) The only time he met his wife in person after \ntheir marriage was in a third country (not Pakistan or the United States) in 2014. (Tr. \n141-142)  \n \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother was killed by the Taliban. (Tr. 140, 162) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and his stepchildren live in the house that was once owed by her \nbrother. (Tr. 162) Applicant\u2019s stepchildren now own the home in Pakistan that they \ninherited from Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brother. (Tr. 162)  \n \nApplicant has some bank accounts in the United States with about $15,000 in \nthem; however, he does not own any real estate in the United States. (Tr. 77) He owns a \ncar and rents an apartment in the United States. (Tr. 78) He was unsure of the status of \nsome land his father owned in Afghanistan, and he does not own any property in \nPakistan. (Tr. 79) Applicant renounced his Afghan citizenship. (Tr. 163) Applicant does \nnot have any relatives that live in the United States. (Tr. 163)  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant was terminated from \nemployment as a government contractor in April 2013 for job abandonment (\u00b6 2.a); \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant failed to disclose that he did not provide financial support to his second spouse \non his April 26, 2016 SCA (\u00b6 2.c); and Applicant failed to disclose that he was married to \nhis second spouse, a citizen and resident of Pakistan, during a counterintelligence \ninterview on September 13, 2013 (\u00b6 2.d).  \n \nIn April 2013, Applicant was on leave from Afghanistan in the United States. (Tr. \n49-50) An investigator was interviewing him, and he missed his flight back to \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 50, 105-106) He called his employer about missing his flight, and was \ninformed that he needed to report to Afghanistan as scheduled. (Tr. 50-52) He told his \nemployer he could not report on time. (Tr. 52) He waited for a follow-up response from \nhis employer for one week, and then he was informed he was terminated for not \nreporting on time to Afghanistan. (Tr. 52) In September 2013, he applied for employment \nwith the same employer, and in January 2014, he returned to Afghanistan, and he was \nemployed by the same employer that fired him in April 2013. (Tr. 53-55) After eight \nmonths working as a linguist with the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, the Marines and \nApplicant returned to the United States as part of the drawdown in U.S. Forces in \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 55) \n \nA copy of Applicant\u2019s 2013 SCA is not part of the record. The summary of \nApplicant\u2019s September 30, 2013 counterintelligence interview and a chart of relatives do \nnot contain any information about his spouse or stepchildren in Pakistan. (Tr. 128; GE 2; \nGE 3) His 2013 counterintelligence summary of interview indicates he disclosed that he \nresides with his \u201cex-girlfriend\u201d and her children, and he provides financial support to her \nand her children. (GE 2 at 13) He said his ex-girlfriend and best friend is a U.S. citizen. \n(GE 3) He also discussed his marriage from his previous spouse in 2001, and he \nprovided information about her U.S. citizenship. (GE 2 at 13; GE 3) In sum, the only \ninformation disclosed during his 2013 counterintelligence interview related to his \nrelationships with a girlfriend and former spouse, and both of these women were U.S. \ncitizens. He did not disclose his marriage to a citizen and resident of Pakistan. \n \nIn his April 26, 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he married his second spouse \nin July 2013, and she lived in Pakistan. (Tr. 74; GE 1) On his April 26, 2016 SCA he did \nnot disclose that he had two stepchildren as a result of his second marriage, and he said \nhe did not provide any financial support to a foreign national. (SOR \u00b6 2.c; GE 1) During \nhis May 2, 2016 counterintelligence interview, he said that he did not disclose his March \n2013 marriage to his second spouse on his previous SCA and counterintelligence \ninterview because he was worried about how it would look to be married to a Pakistani \nwoman while working for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. (Tr. 131-132; GE 4 at 9 (Item 35)) \nHe disclosed his two stepchildren during his May 2, 2016 counterintelligence interview. \nId.      \n \nApplicant\u2019s April 26, 2016 SCA asked Applicant whether he ever provided \nfinancial support for any foreign national, and he responded, no. (Tr. 69; GE 1) He said \nhe misinterpreted the question, as he believed it pertained to support of individuals other \nthan his spouse. (Tr. 71, 135) In June 2016, an Office of Personnel Management \ninvestigator interviewed Applicant, and he disclosed that he provided $500 to $1,000 \nmonthly to his spouse. (Tr. 133-134)  \n \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant said that during his 2013 counterintelligence interview, he did not \ndisclose his marriage to his spouse because he \u201cwas never asked any questions [about \nhis spouse], and it totally went out of [his] mind that [he] should put his wife at that time.\u201d \n(Tr. 73) He said he was unsure about what he was thinking when he was interviewed. \n(Tr. 165) He conceded he \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d (Tr. 74) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant worked for an employer providing overseas linguists from October 2009 \nto May 2013, from January 2014 to November 2014, and from September 2017 to \npresent. (Tr. 57; AE G) He received some unit coins from commanders for his \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. (Tr. 83; AE H) \n \nIn 2010, a first sergeant noted that Applicant \u201cplaced himself in personal danger \ncountless times.\u201d (AE C) He is an \u201cinvaluable force multiplier\u201d and will be an asset to \nmilitary units in the future. (AE C) The Army infantry unit suffered numerous casualties \nincluding 22 killed in action, and Applicant was present during dangerous combat \noperations, and he risked his life on a daily basis. (AE C) He received a certificate of \nappreciation for his exceptional contributions to mission accomplishment, diligence, and \n\u201ccan-do attitude\u201d in 2009 and 2010. (AE F)  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant received a National Guard Commendation Medal approved by \nthe Governor of a state. (AE I; file) He also received an excellent rating for his \ncontributions to an Army unit as a linguist in Afghanistan. (AE I) An Army brigade \ncommander indicated in his performance evaluation: \n \n[Applicant] is a tremendous interpreter, one of the best with whom I have \nserved. His performance as the interpreter of a forward deployed \nmultinational brigade in combat has been simply superb. He is a dynamic \nindividual who uses initiative and boundless energy to improve the \noperational effectiveness of all units within the command and the Soldiers \nin them through his interaction with . . . leaders. \n \nHe is a dedicated professional with an extremely positive attitude and a \nkeen ability to form cohesive teams in an international environment. \n[Applicant] is able to interact with ease to any Pashto or Dari speaking \nindividual - a trait essential to relationship building in [this area]. \n \n[Applicant] is a confident individual who understands operational and \nstrategic imperatives as he circulates in [this] battle space. During his \ntenure as the Commander\u2019s Interpreter for [this] Combined Team . . . , his \npersonal influence on Afghan interaction has enabled the team to \ndrastically improve the stability, security, governance and development \ncapabilities in [this area]. (AE I) \n \nApplicant received multiple certificates of appreciation and letters of support from \na linguist, a captain, a major, a sergeant first class, and his employer for his contributions \nto an armed counterintelligence screening team. (AE B; AE D; AE E; file) One certificate \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nof appreciation praised him for his professionalism, \u201ccalm demeanor and smooth talking \nability.\u201d (AE B) He is one of the most effective and dedicated linguists supporting the \nteam. (AE B) The contractor lauded his exceptional ability as a translator as well as his \ntrustworthiness, efficiency, reliability, and diligence. (AE D) He also received an excellent \nSoldier Performance Appraisal Report form service from November 1, 2010, to January \n2, 2011. (file)    \n \nAfghanistan \n \nAfghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia that is approximately the size of \nTexas (249,935 square miles). Pakistan borders it on the east and the south. Iran \nborders it on the west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country \nwhich has been fought over by powerful nations for centuries. In 2009, the population \nwas about 28 million people with about 3 million Afghans living outside Afghanistan, \nmainly in Pakistan and Iran, although over 5 million have returned since the removal of \nthe Taliban regime. \n \nAfghanistan is presently an Islamic Republic with a democratically-elected \npresident. Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the \nSoviet Union in 1979. After an accord was reached in 1989, and the Soviet Union \nwithdrew from Afghanistan, fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan, and \nreligious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of \nthe country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.   \n \nIn October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the \ncountry, forcing the Taliban out of power by November 2001. The new democratic \ngovernment took power in 2004 after a popular election.  \n \nA U.S. State Department Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan at \nTravel Advisory Level 4-Do not travel. The State Department warns U.S. citizens \nagainst travel to Afghanistan because of continued instability and threats by terrorist \norganizations against U.S. citizens. Travel to all areas of Afghanistan remains unsafe \ndue to the ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, suicide bombings, military \ncombat operations, landmines, terrorist and insurgent attacks, banditry, armed rivalry \nbetween political and tribal groups, militant attacks, direct and indirect fire, and \ninsurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other IEDs. Attacks may also \ntarget official Afghan and U.S. governmental convoys and compounds, foreign \nembassies, military installations, and other public areas. \n \nNo province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the \npotential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, \nagainst U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. Extremists associated with various \nterrorist networks and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout \nthe country and remain violently opposed to the Afghan government and Coalition \nForces. These terrorist groups have attacked Afghan, Coalition Forces, and U.S. targets \nwith little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties.  \n \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nAccording to the June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan, \nAfghanistan faces a continuing threat from insurgent and terrorist networks present or \noperating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Department Counsel\u2019s administrative \nnotice lists recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan resulting in the deaths of hundreds of \ncivilians and military personnel in 2017 and 2018. \n \nIn December 2016, the Department of Defense reported to Congress that, \nalthough al-Qaeda\u2019s core leadership in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region has \nbeen degraded, elements continue to seek safe haven on both sides of the border to \nregenerate and conduct attack planning.  \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Afghanistan is balanced against \nthe inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan to its citizens and residents \nand Afghan government problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top \nnational security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, \ntraining, and support of the Afghanistan Government and military in the ongoing war \nagainst terrorism. \n \nPakistan \n \nPakistan is a parliamentary federal republic with a population of more than 167 \nmillion people. After September 11, 2001, Pakistan supported the United States and an \ninternational coalition in Operation Enduring Freedom to remove the Taliban from power \nin Afghanistan. The United States and Pakistan have common interests in a peaceful, \nstable, and prosperous region. Despite this support, members of the Taliban and \nseveral terrorist groups are known to operate in several \u201csafe havens\u201d in Pakistan.   \n \nPakistan has numerous human rights issues including extrajudicial and targeted \nkillings, disappearances, torture, violations of the rule of law, mob violence, and limited \naccountability. Government restrictions, corruption, and a culture of impunity are serious \nproblems in Pakistan. Lack of accountability for violations of the law and human rights \nabuses are common. \n \nSome terrorist groups have had success raising funds in Pakistan. Taliban \nfinancing has been traced from Pakistan to Afghanistan, enabling the insurgency in \nAfghanistan to strengthen its military and technical capabilities. Pakistan has intensified \nits counterinsurgency efforts, but its record for dealing with militants has been mixed. \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has defined several areas of Pakistan to be \nterrorist safe havens. Although al-Qaeda in Pakistan has been seriously degraded, \nterrorist groups continue to operate in Pakistan. Attacks have resulted in hundreds of \ncasualties.   \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens of the risks of traveling to \nPakistan in light of terrorist activity. Terrorists have attacked numerous locations \nthroughout Pakistan.   \n \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nPakistan and the United States are allies in counterterrorism. Pakistan is \ncommitted to elimination of terrorist camps on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and sent \nthousands of troops and sustained hundreds of casualties in this effort. Overall, \nPakistan has intensified counterinsurgency efforts and demonstrated determination and \npersistence in combating militants. The United States is engaging in a substantial effort \nto bolster Pakistan\u2019s military forces and security.  \n \nPresident Obama said that Pakistan is an essential partner of the United States \nin South Asia, and he committed to the shared security and prosperity between these \ntwo great democracies. The United States is Pakistan\u2019s largest trading partner. In 2013, \nthe United States invested more than $2 billion in Pakistan. United States investments \nin the energy, research and development, and education sectors are particularly \nsignificant. In 2013, the United States and Pakistan committed to strengthening \nrelationships between the two countries. President Obama said that Pakistan \nAmericans living in the United States \u201care enormous contributors to the growth and \ndevelopment of the United States.\u201d The United States has increased investment in the \nU.S. Embassy in Islamabad, and this included hiring additional personnel and \nconstruction of a new embassy.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant admitted that his spouse is a citizen and resident of Pakistan; and his \nmother and brother were and possibly are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. He has \nfrequent contacts with his spouse, but not with his mother and brother. His frequent \ncontacts with his spouse in Pakistan are a manifestation of his care and concern for her. \nThe focus of the discussion must be on his family in Pakistan, and not on his family in \nAfghanistan because he has not had contact with his family in Afghanistan for more \nthan 20 years.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \u201cThe \npresence of close relatives in a country in which terrorists operate and/or which has a \npoor human rights record is significant in Guideline B cases.\u201d ISCR Case No. 11-06925 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2013) at 4 (discussing denial of access to classified information \nbecause of relatives in Pakistan). \u201cFactors such as the obscurity of foreign relatives or \nthe failure of foreign persons to contact those relatives do not provide a meaningful \nmeasure of whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances pose a security risk.\u201d Id. \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Pakistan primarily \nbecause of terrorists and criminals. Applicant has voluntarily shared in dangers from \nterrorists on behalf of the DOD when he was deployed to Afghanistan as a linguist for a \nDOD contractor, and he is willing to do so in the future. Numerous linguists, supporting \nU.S. forces, have family living in countries that have problems with terrorists and \ncriminals. Thousands of United States and coalition armed forces and civilian \ncontractors that have served in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan have \nbeen and are targets of terrorists, along with their families, located in those countries.   \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Pakistan is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or \nher spouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMar. 13, 2017)). These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Pakistan and Afghanistan with the United States, and the situations in \nthose countries places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate \nthat his relationships with any family member living in or visiting those countries does \nnot pose a trustworthiness or security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a \ndesire to assist a relative living in or visiting Pakistan or Afghanistan.3  \n \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \n                                            \n3 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n14                                                                                                                                           \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Pakistan or Afghanistan seek or have sought classified or economic \ninformation from or through Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule \nout such a possibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Pakistan \nand Afghanistan have a significant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family \nin Pakistan \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those \nwho seek U.S. information or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon \nhim.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-\n02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife who is a citizen and resident of Pakistan \ncreates a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on her in \nan effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. This relationship \ncreates \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d \nunder AG \u00b6 7. Her citizenship and residence in Pakistan, and Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith her, has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of \nany mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n\n \n15                                                                                                                                           \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nApplicant has not had any contact with his brother since 1995 and his mother \nsince 1998 or 1999. He does not know if they are alive or dead. Assuming one or both of \nthem are alive, he does not know if they still live in Afghanistan or have moved to \nanother country. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c). Foreign \ninfluence security concerns relating to his mother and brother will not be further \ndiscussed in this opinion.   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies to his relationships with his spouse and stepchildren \nliving in Pakistan. Applicant has frequent contacts with and provides financial support to \nhis spouse and stepchildren, who are citizens and residents of Pakistan.4 A key factor in \nthe AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S.\u201d Applicant resided in the United States from 1995 to present, except for his \n                                            \n4 See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd.

He is renting his residence and has bank accounts in the United \nStates. He honorably served as a linguist in Afghanistan.  \n      \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Afghanistan, including the dangers that service \nentailed, weighs heavily towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant seeks a security \nclearance to enable him to continue serving the Middle East providing assistance to \nDOD. He has shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his \nsupport to DOD while serving in Afghanistan.   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

He is \nunable to travel to Pakistan to visit his family because he will be subject to risk of injury \nor death from terrorists and criminals. \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Pakistan are too \nsignificant to mitigate in the circumstances Applicant presented. His connections to the \nUnited States taken together are not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose that he did not provide financial support to his spouse \non his April 26, 2016 SCA, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. This mistake was not intentional \nand was not made with intent to deceive. He disclosed the existence of his spouse in \n\n \n18                                                                                                                                           \nPakistan on his April 26, 2016 SCA. It was reasonable to assume that he was providing \nfinancial support to her, and his failure to disclose such financial support was an \nunintentional error. See also AG \u00b6 20(f), infra.   \n \nApplicant presented extenuating information relating to his termination from \nemployment as a government contractor in April 2013 for job abandonment. He missed \nhis flight due to needing to complete a security-related interview. He showed poor \njudgment when he failed to take the next available flight to report for duty. However, this \npoor judgment did not recur, is not recent, and his employer rehired him. The record \ndoes not establish AG \u00b6 19(e) because his termination from employment did not create \na vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is established because he intentionally failed to disclose information \nabout his marriage to his spouse, who was a citizen and resident of Pakistan, as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 2.d. Consideration of mitigating conditions is required. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \n\n \n19                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant failed to disclose that he was married to his spouse a citizen and \nresident of Pakistan during his counterintelligence interview on September 13, 2013. \nDuring his May 2, 2016 counterintelligence interview, he said that he did not disclose his \nMarch 2013 marriage on his counterintelligence interview because he was worried \nabout how it would look to be married to a Pakistan woman while working for U.S. \nForces in Afghanistan. His omission of information about his marriage to a citizen and \nresident of Pakistan during his 2013 counterintelligence interview was intentional. His \nclaim at his hearing that the investigator did not ask him about his marriage is not \ncredible. AG \u00b6 2.d is not mitigated. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is 51 years old, and he is seeking employment in Afghanistan as a CAT \nII linguist in Afghanistan. He was born in Afghanistan, and in 1995, he immigrated to the \nUnited States. In 2005, he became a U.S. citizen.  \n \nApplicant worked for several years in Afghanistan as a linguist. He was \nrepeatedly exposed to combat conditions including small arms fires, indirect weapons \nfires, IEDs, and RPGs. Soldiers in his vicinity were killed in combat. On one occasion, \nhis vehicle was hit with an IED and turned over. Applicant has experienced problems \nwith his sleep and memory, and he attributes his medical problems in part, to his service \nin Afghanistan. As recently as 2018, he was on patrols involving the death of Taliban \nmilitary personnel. Applicant\u2019s employer and Soldiers that served with Applicant in \nAfghanistan lauded his diligence, professionalism, intelligence, and contributions to \nmission accomplishment in an evaluation, letters, statements, certificates, and a medal.  \n \n\n \n20                                                                                                                                           \nConnections to foreign countries must be balanced against connections to the \nUnited States. Applicant resided in the United States from 1995 to present, except for \nseveral years when he was serving in Afghanistan as a linguist and brief visits to other \ncountries. He is renting an apartment in the United States, and he has bank accounts in \nthe United States. He took the oath of allegiance to the United States when he became \na U.S. citizen. He does not have any relatives that live in the United States. \n \nApplicant served U.S. interests as a linguist in Afghanistan. He made \ncontributions at personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan. All these \ncircumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report \nany attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit \nhim. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past honorable \nservice in Afghanistan weighs heavily towards mitigation of foreign influence security \nconcerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming grant of \nsecurity clearance and commenting \u201cApplicant has served as a translator and as a \ncultural liaison between Americans and Afghan citizens, diffusing tensions and \nfacilitating transactions between the two groups. . . . Applicant put his life in danger on \nat least one occasion to protect American lives and interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nA Guideline B decision must take into consideration the geopolitical situation and \ndangers of the country involved.6 Pakistan is a dangerous place due to violence from \nterrorists and criminals, and Pakistan\u2019s government does not respect the full spectrum \nof human rights. Terrorists continue to threaten Pakistani citizens and residents, the \nPakistan government, the interests of the United States, and those who cooperate and \nassist the United States. The United States and Pakistan are democracies, allies in the \nwar on terrorism, and trading partners. They have numerous important common \ninterests.  \n \nApplicant has frequent contact with or cares for his wife and stepchildren, who \nare citizens and residents of Pakistan. They have never been to the United States. He \nprovides financial support to his spouse and stepchildren. Applicant is well known in \nPakistan, and he believes he cannot safely visit his family in Pakistan. Frequent \ncontacts with and financial support for family in foreign countries are manifestations of \none\u2019s care and concern for relatives living in those foreign countries. There is no \nevidence that his relatives are current employees of foreign governments or foreign \nmilitary personnel. His relationships with residents and citizens of Pakistan raise \nimportant foreign influence security concerns. \n \nApplicant intentionally omitted information about his spouse in Pakistan during \nhis counterintelligence interview in 2013. He told the truth in his 2016 \ncounterintelligence interview when he admitted this omission was designed to conceal \nhis relationship with his spouse because of its security or employment ramifications. At \nhis hearing, he falsely claimed that in 2013, the counterintelligence investigator did not \nask him about his marriage.    \n \n                                            \n6 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). \n\n \n21                                                                                                                                           \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence and \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAgainst APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 26, 2016. On \nJune 26, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 26, 2017, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \n02/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nwritten case on September 10, 2018, and sent a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He did not \nrespond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2019.  \n \nThe FORM included Item 4, a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) \nconducted on March 8, 2017. The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, \ndeletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summary by \nfailing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like \nlawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights \nunder the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old electrical designer employed by a defense contractor \nsince February 2005. He graduated from high school and attended college from \nSeptember 1981 to May 1985 but did not receive a degree. He has never married, but \nhe has lived with a cohabitant for 16 years. He and his cohabitant have resided in their \njointly owned home since June 2000. He has no children. He has never held a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2005 and received a discharge in \nAugust 2005. In his answer to the SOR, he attributed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy to a \nperiod of unemployment. Since receiving a discharge, he has accumulated 11 \ndelinquent debts totaling about $13,000 that are reflected in credit reports from April \n2017 (Item 5) and September 2015 (Item 6). In his answer to the SOR, he attributed his \ncurrent financial situation to the expense of adding an in-law suite to his home to \naccommodate his cohabitant\u2019s ailing mother. His cohabitant\u2019s mother provided funds for \nthe construction until his cohabitant\u2019s sister stopped the funding, under circumstances \nnot reflected in the record. Applicant completed the construction by using credit cards \nand cash advances. The delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.m are credit-card \naccounts and loans. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m is a medical bill. Applicant provided \nno information about the circumstances in which the medical bill was incurred. \n \n \nIn the March 2017 PSI and his answer to the SOR, Applicant declared his \nintention to file another petition for bankruptcy. As of the date the record closed, he had \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nnot done so. He has submitted no evidence of efforts to resolve the debts alleged in the \nSOR. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) \n(\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n5 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the 2005 bankruptcy, which is mitigated by the \npassage of time. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.l, which are \nrecent, numerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the bankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s loss of employment was \na circumstance beyond his control, and bankruptcy was a legal and prudent course of \naction. The loss of funding for the in-law suite was a condition beyond his control, but he \nhas not demonstrated responsible conduct in resolving the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-\n1.l. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not established. Applicant presented no \nevidence of financial counseling beyond what would have been required for the \nbankruptcy in 2005. He presented no evidence of contacts with creditors, payments, or \npayment plans for his delinquent debts. He has not disputed any of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.l: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nRemand Decision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate Common Access Card (CAC) credentialing concerns \nraised under the criminal or dishonest conduct and intentional false statement \nsupplemental adjudicative standards. CAC eligibility is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 29, 2016, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive \nPositions (SF 85). On November 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing concerns for CAC eligibility pursuant \nto Homeland Security Presidential Directive \u2013 12, Policy for Common Identification \nStandard for Federal Employees and Contractors, dated August 27, 2004 (HSPD-12). \nDOD was unable to find that granting Applicant CAC eligibility posed an acceptable risk.  \nThe action is based on the Supplemental Adjudicative Standards found in DOD \nInstruction 5200.46, DOD Investigative and Adjudicative Guidelines for Issuing the \nCommon Access Card, dated September 9, 2014, and the procedures set out in \nEnclosure 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The concerns raised under \nthe Supplemental Adjudicative Standards of DODI 5200.46 are criminal or dishonest \nconduct and material, intentional false statement. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 13, 2017, and follow-up email dated \nJanuary 26, 2018, and requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \n10/11/2018\n\n \n2 \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the \nSOR and stated that she wanted \u201cto discuss further in court.\u201d The case was forwarded \nto the Hearing Office and assigned to me on March 8, 2018. On August 22, 2018, a \nNotice of Hearing was sent out scheduling the hearing for April 12, 2018. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) were not available for the hearing.1 I left the \nrecord open until April 26, 2018, for Department Counsel to provide the GEs to \nApplicant. She did not object and GE 1 through 4 were later admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. After the hearing, Applicant also submitted a one-page document \nentitled closing statement that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A) and admitted \nwithout objection. At the hearing, Applicant testified on her own behalf. Based on the \nrecord evidence and testimony presented in this case, CAC eligibility was denied.  \n \nI issued my original decision on June 15, 2018, denying Applicant\u2019s CAC \neligibility. Applicant appealed that decision. On September 19, 2018, the Appeal Board \nremanded the case for a new decision based on the fact that I applied the wrong \nstandard for adjudicating CAC eligibility. I erroneously stated that \u201cany doubt concerning \npersonnel being adjudicated for CAC eligibility should be resolved in favor of the \nnational interest.\u201d (Policies section of original decision) In the Conclusion section, I \nstated that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant CAC \neligibility.\u201d The correct standard is set forth in Paragraph 4 of the CAC Adjudicative \nProcedures (DOD Instruction 5200.46, Encl. 4 \u00b6 4), which states \u201cThe determination will \nbe unfavorable . . . when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that derogatory \ninformation or conduct relating to the supplemental CAC credentialing standards \npresents an unacceptable risk for the U.S. Government [,]\u201d and is repeated in the initial \nparagraph of each supplemental adjudicative standard. Although the correct \n\u201cunacceptable risk\u201d standard was repeatedly referenced in the original decision, the \nerroneous references to \u201cconsistent with the national interest\u201d left confusion. I have now \napplied the correct standard and reach the same result for the same reasons.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Her SOR answer is incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. She contends that she would not deliberately or intentionally falsify a \ngovernment form, and she has not been arrested for over five years, and has worked on \na military installation with a CAC credential for over one year.  \n \nBackground Information \n \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. She has been employed - using her CAC since \nDecember 12, 2016 by a federal contractor, aboard a military installation. (AE B, Tr. 24) \nApplicant graduated high school in 1996 and had some college courses. She was \n                                                          \n1 Department Counsel\u2019s briefcase was sidetracked en route to the hearing. I left the record open for him to \nsubmit the GEs, which had already been provided in discovery, to Applicant. I also allowed time for \nApplicant to object. She did not raise an objection.  \n \n\n \n3 \nmarried in 2004, and recently separated in 2015. She had no children by that marriage, \nbut she has a 25-year old son who still lives with her. (Tr. 24-25) She is profoundly \ndisabled. She seeks CAC eligibility as a condition of her continued employment. (GE 1; \nTr. 10) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6 1 several minor offenses or infractions committed by \nApplicant between 2008 and 2013. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges she was charged with reckless \ndriving on March 29, 2013. Applicant admitted this and testified that she drove off at a \nhigh rate of speed after a dispute with her husband. (Tr. 24) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege \nApplicant was arrested on April 27, 2012, for theft by deception for passing bad checks \nunder $50, and other bad checks under $10. She admitted to both and testified that it \nwas one arrest but she was subsequently found guilty on all counts. (Tr. 15-16) SOR \u00b6 \n1.d alleges that on January 14, 2011, Applicant gave a false name to a police officer, \nand she was also charged with possession of marijuana (MJ) and drug paraphernalia. \nShe admitted these allegations and she was sentenced to 20 days (served over 10 \nweekends) in jail. (Tr. 28) Applicant testified that she went out to walk her dog in the \nmiddle of the night and discovered a police officer hiding in her bushes. She was scared \nand refused to provide her correct name and address. (Tr. 29) Within minutes, several \npolice officers showed up and entered her home to find a remnants of an MJ cigarette, \nand MJ residue in an ashtray. (Tr. 31) She claimed that the MJ belonged to her \nhusband and cousin. I did not find this testimony to be credible. She pled guilty to all \ncharges. (Tr. 31-32)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant was arrested for cruelty to animals on May 21, 2010. \nShe testified that she came home from work to discover her dog missing. She conferred \nwith her son and they determined that the dog was mysteriously taken by animal control \nofficers, from inside the home, because it was deprived of water. (Tr. 33-34) Applicant \noffered few details of this taking, and I did not find her to be complete or credible. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s earliest arrests were for harassing communications on April 14, 2008, \nand again on April 30, 2008. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g) She testified that both arrests \nstemmed from a dispute with another woman with whom Applicant\u2019s husband was \ncheating. (Tr. 36) This interloper supposedly followed Applicant everywhere. So, \nApplicant threatened to beat her up and the woman reported this to police. (Tr. 37-38) \nApplicant testified that a restraining order was entered mandating that she stay away \nfrom the woman for six months and then the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 38). \nApplicant has no additional arrests since 2013. Applicant provided two positive \ncharacter-reference letters attesting to her hard work and kindness. (AE A and B) She \nnotes that she is in good standing with her employer, which made special \naccommodations for her. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed her Declaration for Federal Employment (Form 306) \non December 12, 2016, she answered yes to item 9, which asked \u201cDuring the last 7 \nyears, have you been convicted, been imprisoned, been on probation, or been on \nparole?\u201d (GE 2, Tr. 40) However, she only disclosed the 2012 check offenses and the \n2011 arrest for providing false information to a policeman. She filled out the Form 306 in \na classroom setting. She testified that it was not her intent to falsify a government form. \n\n \n4 \n(Tr. 19-20) She simply forgot about all the various misdemeanors. In particular, she \nforgot to list the only offense for which she went to jail at SOR 1.d. The only reason \nApplicant could ascribe for her omissions was \u201csimple forgetfulness.\u201d (Tr. 42)  \n \n    Policies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nissues raised are listed in DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative \nStandards, and Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards. The overriding factor \nfor all of these conditions is unacceptable risk. \u201cThe determination made will be \nunfavorable . . . when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that derogatory \ninformation or conduct relating to the supplemental CAC credentialing standards \npresents an unacceptable risk to the U.S. Government.\u201d2   \n \n \nThe objective of CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. Each case must be judged on its own merits, \ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, \nmature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; \n(3) the recency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or \npresence of efforts towards rehabilitation. (DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, paragraph 1) In \nall adjudications, the avoidance of unacceptable risk is the paramount consideration.  \nTherefore, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for CAC eligibility should \nbe resolved against the Applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, Paragraphs 2.a., and 2.b(1)(3)(4) and (7) articulate the CAC concern: \n \n                                                          \n2 DOD Instruction 5200.46, Enclosure 4 \u00b6 4 (Sep. 9, 2014). \n\n \n5 \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s criminal or dishonest conduct, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.  \n \n \nDODI Instruction 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards lists the following conditions that raises a CAC concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n2.a An individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about his or her reliability or trustworthiness and may \nput people, property, or information systems at risk. An individual\u2019s past \ncriminal or dishonest conduct may put people, property, or information \nsystems at risk.  \n \n2.b Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include: \n \n           (1) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses which put the safety  \n \nof people at risk or threaten the protection of property or information; \n \n(3) Dishonest acts (e.g., theft, accepting bribes, falsifying claims, perjury,     \nforgery, or attempting to obtain identity documentation without proper \nauthorization); and \n \n(4) Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, or other intentional financial breaches of \ntrust. \n \n \nThe Government established this disqualifying condition through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented in the criminal history reports (GE 4).  \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, Paragraph 2.c provides a list of circumstances relevant to the determination \nof whether there is a reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. In \nparticular, Paragraph 2.c.(1) is applicable: \n \n2.c.(1) \u2013 The behavior happened so long ago, was minor in nature, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.  \n \n           The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g concern a minor personal dispute that \noccurred over 10 years ago, and the charges were dismissed. I find that these \nallegations have been mitigated by the passage of time and are not likely to recur. \nHowever, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f have not been mitigated.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \nIntentional False Statement, Deception or Fraud \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, Paragraphs 3, 3.a., and 3.b. articulate the CAC concern: \n \n \n3. A CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to believe,  \nbased on the individual\u2019s material, intentional, false statement, deception, or  \nfraud in connection with federal or contract employment, that issuance of a CAC  \nposes an unacceptable risk.  \n \n \nDODI Instruction 5200.46, Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards \nlists the following conditions that raise a CAC concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n3.a The individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s honesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nput people, property, or information systems at risk; and \n \n3.b Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include material, \nintentional falsification, deception, or fraud related to answers or \ninformation provided during the employment process for the current or a \nprior federal or contract employment (e.g., on the employment application, \nor other employment, appointment or investigative documents, or during \ninterviews). \n \n3.c Circumstances relevant to the determination of whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk include: \n \n    (1) The misstated or omitted information was so long ago, was minor,   \n     or happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to  \n     recur; and \n \n    (2) The misstatement or omission was unintentional or inadvertent  \n    and was followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation.  \n \n \nApplicant answered yes to a question in section 9 of her Declaration for Federal \nEmployment (Form 306) that asked about any convictions during the last seven years. \nHowever, she only listed two of her misdemeanor arrests, for check fraud and providing \nfalse information to a police officer. She omitted the most serious offenses, for \npossession of MJ and drug paraphernalia and cruelty to animals. Applicant\u2019s only \nexplanation was that she forgot to list these offenses. I did not find her explanation to be \nforthright or candid in this regard. The disqualifying condition in \u00b6 3.b above is \napplicable. She did not provide sufficient information to mitigate her lack of complete \ndisclosure on her Declaration for Federal Employment.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nDODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, CAC Adjudicative Procedures, Paragraph 1, \nGuidance For Applying Credentialing Standards During Adjudication provides the \nfollowing factors: \n \na. As established in Reference (g), credentialing adjudication considers \nwhether or not an individual is eligible for long-term access to federally \ncontrolled facilities and/or information systems. The ultimate determination \nto authorize, deny, or revoke the CAC based on a credentialing \ndetermination of the PSI must be made after consideration of applicable \ncredentialing standards in Reference (c); and \n \nb. Each case is unique. Adjudicators must examine conditions that raise \nan adjudicative concern, the overriding factor for all of these conditions is \nunacceptable risk. Factors to be applied consistently to all information \navailable to the adjudicator are: \n \n \n(1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct. The more serious \nthe conduct, the greater the potential for an adverse CAC determination. \n \n \n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Sufficient \ninformation concerning the circumstances of the conduct must be obtained \nto determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the conduct \nposes a risk to people, property, or information systems. \n \n \n(3) The recency and frequency of the conduct. More recent or more \nfrequent conduct is of greater concern.  \n \n \n(4) The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct. \nOffenses committed as a minor are usually treated as less serious than \nthe same offenses committed as an adult, unless the offense is very \nrecent, part of a pattern, or particularly heinous. \n \n \n(5) Contributing external conditions. Economic and cultural \nconditions may be relevant to the determination of whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk if the conditions \nare currently removed or countered (generally considered in cases with \nrelatively minor issues). \n \n \n(6) The absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation, if \nrelevant, to address conduct adverse to CAC determinations. \n \n \n   (a) Clear, affirmative evidence of rehabilitation is required for a \nfavorable adjudication (e.g., seeking assistance and following professional \nguidance, where appropriate; demonstrating positive changes in behavior \nand employment). \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n   (b) Rehabilitation may be a consideration for most conduct, not \njust alcohol and drug abuse. While formal counseling or treatment may be \na consideration, other factors (such as the individual\u2019s employment record) \nmay also be indications of rehabilitation. \n \n  \n Applicant has overcome tremendous physical challenges and disadvantages. \nHer last offense was committed in 2013, so her misconduct has been partially mitigated \nby the passage of time. However, she has established a pattern of minor violations of \nthe law. This undermines any assurance that she will be trustworthy and reliable in \ncomplying with responsibilities of her fiduciary relationship with the government. Her \nfailure to provide a completely honest response to item 9 of her Form 306 occurred \nrecently in December 2016. It is hard to imagine how she could forget about the animal \ncruelty conviction and drug possession arrest \u2013 for which she spent 20 days in jail. \nThese were her most significant offenses. Applicant provided no explanation other than \nher forgetfulness for this glaring omission. She provided no evidence of restitution for \nthe cold checks, and her explanation for the MJ possession conviction is unavailing.  \n \n \nHaving carefully considered the facts of this case, I find \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. (1), (4) and (7) of \nthe credentialing standards are applicable. Applicant\u2019s minor violations were frequent, \nand her falsification of the Form 306 was recent.

She did not provide sufficient evidence to explain and \nmitigate her history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against \nApplicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non February 9, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on July 10, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2017. Her answers were mixed. She \nalso requested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 17, 2017. The hearing scheduled for \nJanuary 23, 2018, was postponed due to a government shutdown. The hearing took \nplace as rescheduled on April 17, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. \nDepartment Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-\n5. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-F. No \nwitnesses were called other than Applicant.  \n  \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. She is employed as a security guard for a company doing \nbusiness in the defense industry. She has been so employed since November 2015.  \nShe has been steadily employed other than a period of unemployment from October \n2010 to August 2012.  \n \nApplicant has married twice and has three minor children from her first marriage. \nShe married the first time in October 2003 and divorced, after a separation, in January \n2014. She married the second time in July 2014 and separated in February 2017. A \nJanuary 2014 child-support order required the father to provide medical insurance for \nthe children, and the costs of medical, dental, and vision expenses not paid by \ninsurance were shared equally between Applicant and the father.2 That was modified in \nMarch 2015 with Applicant and her ex-husband having joint legal custody of the three \nchildren; neither is obliged to pay the other child support; and she is responsible for \nproviding medical, dental, and vision insurance for the minor children.3 \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems, including a joint Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy case with her first husband ending in discharge of more than $250,000 in \nliabilities4 and 42 delinquent accounts ranging in amounts from $57 to $6,341 for a total \nof approximately $33,751. The 42 delinquent accounts in the SOR consist of 2 unpaid \njudgments, 34 medical collection accounts, and 6 consumer accounts. Several of the \nmedical collection accounts are for relatively small or minor amounts (e.g., $57). The \nSOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from 2016 \nand 2017.5 Other than the consumer account in SOR \u00b6 1.dd for $618, the delinquent \n                                                          \n2 Exhibit A.  \n \n3 Exhibit A.  \n \n4 Exhibit B.  \n \n5 Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \naccounts have not been paid, settled, placed into a repayment arrangement, forgiven, \ncancelled, or otherwise resolved. The $618 consumer account was reduced to a \njudgment in March 2015, which was satisfied after making a series of payments for a \ntotal of $1,507 in December 2016.6 In addition, the delinquent consumer accounts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.l for $1,171 each are duplicates.7 And the delinquent consumer \naccount for $238 in SOR \u00b6 1.jj was included in the bankruptcy.8 \n \nConcerning the 34 medical collection accounts, Applicant explained she denied \nthe medical collection accounts in her answer to the SOR because she believes her first \nhusband is responsible for those debts.9 She admitted that she had not \u201ctouched\u201d the \nmedical collection accounts, and she was unaware of how much medical debt she \ncurrently owes.10 She presented medical billing information addressed to her that shows \nshe owes or is past due on more than $5,000.11 A review of the February 2016 credit \nreport, which was obviously relied on in drafting the SOR, shows the medical collection \naccounts are described as individual accounts.12 \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial situation is less than stable. She described her \nfinancial situation as living paycheck to paycheck and her husband\u2019s work history as \n\u201cvery rough.\u201d13 She has no cash savings of any kind.14 In addition to the indebtedness \ndiscussed above, she owes approximately $15,291 in student loans, which are in \nforbearance.15 She stated that she is current with filing state and federal income tax \nreturns.16 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n                                                          \n6 Exhibit C.  \n \n7 Tr. 55.  \n \n8 Tr. 58-59.  \n \n9 Tr. 50-51. \n \n10 Tr. 52-53.  \n \n11 Exhibit D.  \n \n12 Exhibit 3.  \n \n13 Tr. 62-63; 65.  \n \n14 Tr. 61.  \n \n15 Exhibit E; Tr. 62.  \n \n16 Tr. 63-64. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.17 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d18 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.19 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.20 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.21 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.22 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.23 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.24 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.25 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.26 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n17 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .27 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute of provides \nevidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The two \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n                                                          \n27 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConcerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant is in a difficult \nsituation, and I certainly have empathy for her. But even if I set aside the numerous \nmedical collection accounts, she still has two unpaid judgments for about $8,000 and \nsome delinquent consumer debt for which she has done nothing to resolve. Her \nhousehold income is now limited to what she earns due to her marital separation. She \nhas no cash savings or financial reserve and no plan to address her delinquent debts. \nGiven the facts and circumstances of her financial situation, it is likely that most of the \nindebtedness in the SOR will remain unpaid regardless of the outcome of this case. It is \nalso likely that the financial strain she is under will increase when her student loans exit \nforbearance. Although I have credited Applicant for circumstances largely beyond her \ncontrol (the marital difficulties in particular), her evidence is not sufficient to fully explain \nand mitigate the security concern stemming from her long-standing history of financial \nproblems, which is ongoing and likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she has not met her \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m -- 1.ee: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.dd: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.ee -- 1.ii:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.jj:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.kk -- 1.qq: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. 3 Applicant is 61 years old and not married. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree conferred in 1978 and a master\u2019s degree conferred in 1991. He has been employed by a defense contractor in purchasing since January 2016. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 34.) Applicant worked as a senior associate in business and purchasing services for a college from October 2005 to October 2014. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) He resigned from his employment under imminent threat of discharge following incidents of sexual harassment or inappropriate conduct involving women. After informal counseling to increase his awareness of the impact of his comments on co-workers, Applicant was suspended without pay from July 14, 2009, to July 28, 2009, for violation of the college\u2019s sexual harassment policy and state regulation.1 A 20-year-old student employee (Ms. X) complained that he had looked up her skirt during inventory work. He was kneeling on the floor managing paper lists and metal tags to attach to items, and she was standing to pull the equipment and attach the metal tags. He claims that he was incapable of looking up her skirt because he was faced away from her and had neck problems. However, the college\u2019s investigation revealed that he had behaved inappropriately toward the student during the inventory and over the previous two years, and that the conduct had persisted despite counseling and warnings from his supervisor.",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant resigned from his job at a college in October 2014 after being repeatedly \ndisciplined for inappropriate comments and conduct toward female staff members and \nstudents since 2009. Personal conduct concerns also exist because of his lack of candor \non his security clearance application about his disciplinary infractions at the college. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 1, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n08/16/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 7, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nOn February 9, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On February 26, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for March 20, 2018.  \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were admitted in evidence. A \nFebruary 8, 2018 letter forwarding discovery of the GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs \nwere marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I-II), but were not admitted as evidentiary exhibits. \nTen Applicant exhibits (AEs A-J) were admitted in evidence, and Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 28, 2018. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant was suspended from his job at a \ncollege for ten days without pay in July 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and for five days without pay in \nJuly 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) for violating the college\u2019s sexual harassment policy; that he received \na disciplinary notice and was suspended for ten days without pay by the college in \nDecember 2012 for having inappropriate conversations with a female student (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \nand that he resigned from his position at the college in August 2014 following a complaint \nof inappropriate behavior toward a female contract employee (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Additionally, \nApplicant is alleged to have falsified his December 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (SF 86) by responding negatively to an inquiry about whether he \nhad been warned or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace in the last seven years \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he had been suspended as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but he \ndenied any validity to the female\u2019s complaint in that he was physically incapable of the \nmisconduct. Applicant also acknowledged his employment suspension alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, but he asserted the discipline was unwarranted because his behavior consisted of \nplayful interaction and harmless social comments to a friend. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.c \nbecause he had no recall of any disciplinary action in December 2012. Regarding SOR \u00b6 \n1.d, he explained that the accusation was a defensive action taken by a contract employee \nin an attempt to keep her job. In response to the alleged falsification of his SF 86, Applicant \nadmitted that he had not disclosed that he had received discipline or warnings, but he \ndenied deliberate falsification. He claimed that he had responded \u201cYes\u201d but then did not \nhave the specific details to complete the section and was not allowed to progress without \nthe information.

He has a bachelor\u2019s degree conferred in \n1978 and a master\u2019s degree conferred in 1991. He has been employed by a defense \ncontractor in purchasing since January 2016. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 34.) \n \nApplicant worked as a senior associate in business and purchasing services for a \ncollege from October 2005 to October 2014. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) He resigned from his \nemployment under imminent threat of discharge following incidents of sexual harassment \nor inappropriate conduct involving women. \n \nAfter informal counseling to increase his awareness of the impact of his comments \non co-workers, Applicant was suspended without pay from July 14, 2009, to July 28, 2009, \nfor violation of the college\u2019s sexual harassment policy and state regulation.1 A 20-year-old \nstudent employee (Ms. X) complained that he had looked up her skirt during inventory \nwork. He was kneeling on the floor managing paper lists and metal tags to attach to items, \nand she was standing to pull the equipment and attach the metal tags. He claims that he \nwas incapable of looking up her skirt because he was faced away from her and had neck \nproblems. However, the college\u2019s investigation revealed that he had behaved \ninappropriately toward the student during the inventory and over the previous two years, \nand that the conduct had persisted despite counseling and warnings from his supervisor. \nApplicant maintains that Ms. X initiated flirtatious behavior, and he reciprocated. Applicant \nwas warned that any subsequent violations could result in more severe disciplinary action, \nup to and including termination. He was required to have counseling through the Employee \nAssistance Program (EAP) and to attend a session of his state\u2019s sexual harassment \ntraining. He was also moved to a different building for three months. (GE 3; AE A; Tr. 40-\n47, 62.) Applicant completed the sexual harassment training and approximately six \nsessions of EAP counseling. Applicant testified, with no evidence to the contrary, that the \nEAP counselor did not see the need for further treatment. (Tr. 50-52.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal at the college for 2009 to 2010 indicates that \nApplicant worked hard \u201cto remedy the discomfort of some female staff members cited in his \nlast evaluation.\u201d2 (GE 3.) Yet, in June 2010, an associate personnel manager at the college \nobserved Applicant flick the ponytail of a female cleaning contractor. Concerned about the \nbehavior due to his history, she spoke to Applicant about the inappropriate behavior and \nreported the incident to Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who was also the college\u2019s administrative \n                                                 \n1 Section 46a-60(8) of the state\u2019s general statutes defines sexual harassment as follows: \n \n(8) For an employer, by the employer or the employer's agent, for an employment agency, by \nitself or its agent, or for any labor organization, by itself or its agent, to harass any employee, \nperson seeking employment or member on the basis of sex or gender identity or expression. \n\u201cSexual harassment\u201d shall, for the purposes of this section, be defined as any unwelcome \nsexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when (A) \nsubmission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an \nindividual's employment, (B) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is \nused as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (C) such conduct \nhas the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or \ncreating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation for mid-2008 to mid-2009 is not in evidence. \n\n4 \n \nofficer and chief financial officer. Applicant\u2019s supervisor spoke with Applicant but did not \ndiscipline him at that time. Over the next month, the supervisor received a complaint from \nthe same cleaning contractor that Applicant had asked her if she had a friend for him for a \npossible dating relationship. Then, at a welcome party at work, when a new employee \nrepeatedly told him that he looked familiar, Applicant responded to her that it appeared to \nhim that she was trying to pick him up. On another occasion, Applicant commented to a \nstaff member, who was dangling her feet, that she had nice feet. (GE 3; AE A.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor scheduled a pre-disciplinary meeting for July 9, 2010, to \nprovide Applicant an opportunity to provide reasons why the college should not dismiss him \nfrom employment for his failure to maintain appropriate behavior in the workplace. At the \nmeeting, Applicant initially indicated that his behavior was not worthy of mention.  Applicant \nwas suspended without pay from August 4, 2010, through August 10, 2010, for violating \nthe college\u2019s sexual harassment policy for having inappropriate physical contact with the \nhair of the cleaning contractor. Applicant filed a grievance, although he eventually \ncompleted additional EAP counseling mandated by the college. (GE 3; Tr. 52-57.) \nAccording to Applicant, the EAP counseling resulted in \u201cno findings of any issues.\u201d (Tr. 57.) \n \nOn August 24, 2010, an administrator with the state\u2019s employment security appeals \ndivision ruled that Applicant had been suspended for reasons other than willful misconduct \nin the course of employment. The college appealed, and on October 29, 2010, an appeals \nreferee affirmed the administrator\u2019s decision. Had the college chosen to suspend Applicant \nshortly after his intentional contact with the hair of the female contractor, the appeals \nreferee would have denied unemployment compensation as the physical contact violated \nthe proper boundaries between the female contractor and Applicant, who was in a position \nto affect her livelihood. The college\u2019s appeal was denied because it suspended Applicant \nafter he made two \u201charmless comments\u201d to other staff, and the college did not prove a \n\u201cspecific and final incident of willful misconduct\u201d triggering the discharge or suspension that \nwould have disqualified Applicant from receiving unemployment benefits. (AE A.)  Applicant \ndoes not view his conduct with the female contractor to have been problematic. He testified \nthat she was a \u201cdear friend\u201d with whom he had a very good relationship. They were \n\u201chorsing around\u201d that day, and she had no problem with it. (Tr. 58-60.) \n \nIn early December 2010, a female staff member at the college complained that \nApplicant was giving her unwelcome compliments and inappropriately asking her about the \nstatus of her personal relationships, including whether she had a boyfriend. She indicated \nthat such comments had persisted after she told him that she did not consider them \nappropriate at work and had asked him to desist. When confronted about the behavior by \nhis supervisor, Applicant explained that he learned that the female co-worker was divorced \nand so he had asked her in 2009 whether they would like to get together. She told him that \nshe wanted to keep her personal and work relationships separate. He admitted that, in \nDecember 2010, he \u201cmay have mentioned\u201d to the co-worker that her boyfriend was \u201ca lucky \nguy.\u201d He considered the conversation social chit chat and nothing more. (GE 3.) Applicant \ndoes not believe \u201cthat sort of behavior is something that should make anybody \nuncomfortable.\u201d (Tr. 48.) The incident was resolved without any disciplinary action. (GE 3.) \n \n\n5 \n \nAvailable performance evaluations for Applicant\u2019s work at the college show a record \nof competence, timely completion of tasks, and productivity. Applicant showed some \nimprovement in his interpersonal relations with staff from 2010 to 2011, but there were also \noccasions when his communications took on a perceived tone of authority. He had a \npositive attitude toward the discharge of his work responsibilities, however, and his \nperformance was considered superior in July 2012. (GE 3.) \n \nOn December 14, 2012, a college staff member observed Applicant having a \nconversation with a 17-year-old student worker, who appeared to be uncomfortable. The \nstudent worker expressed that there had been other conversations with Applicant where he \nhad shared information about his search for a young wife in the Ukraine and had told her \nthat he would have liked to have dated her if he was younger. Additionally, he had given \nher some candy with a comment that it was a \u201csweet for a sweet,\u201d and when she gave the \ncandy to another student, he told her that she broke his heart. Applicant does not recall, \nand he cannot imagine that he said \u201ca sweet for a sweet,\u201d but he admits that he probably \ntold the student that she broke his heart because he \u201chorses around.\u201d On December 20, \n2012, the college\u2019s administrative officer held a pre-disciplinary meeting at which Applicant \nexpressed surprise that the student worker might have been uncomfortable with his \ninteractions. He claimed the student encouraged the conversation about his search for a \nUkrainian wife because of their shared experience with Ukraine. She had a Russian name \nand had relatives in Ukraine, and he had traveled to Ukraine. The college suspended \nApplicant for ten days without pay because of his inappropriate interactions with the \nstudent worker and his failure to heed warnings to discontinue such behavior with staff \nmembers. Applicant filed a grievance. His defense was that the student worker was not \nbothered by the conversation and the issue was blown out of proportion. Applicant denied \nthat he had any romantic interest in somebody as young as the female student. (GE 3; Tr. \n61-68.) \n \nOn March 28, 2013, the college\u2019s president upheld the ten-day suspension. \nApplicant had been previously disciplined for similar misconduct and formally warned under \nthe college\u2019s disciplinary process not to engage female employees in conversations that \nwere not work related. The president concluded that Applicant was seemingly incapable of \ndistinguishing between safe personal conversation and intrusive, inappropriate topics. \nApplicant was advised that the onus was on him to avoid personal conversations with co-\nworkers that do not involve work-related topics, and that another, substantiated complaint \nof inappropriate personal conversations with female staff members would result in his \ntermination from employment. (GE 3; Tr. 67-68.) \n \nFor 2012 to 2013, Applicant\u2019s performance in acquiring a sustainability grant for the \ncollege was noted as exceptional. He showed competence in his work with contracts, bids, \nfacility maintenance, and summarizing financial information. He needed improvement in his \ninteractions with a female employee and with follow up on assigned tasks. He performance \noverall was rated as competent. He continued to be a very productive employee for the \ncollege over the next year. (GE 3.) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nOn August 4, 2014, a female contract employee of the college complained that \nApplicant had made inappropriate comments to her; that he was \u201ccoming on\u201d to her; and \nthat he had invited her to his home. Applicant\u2019s supervisor confronted him about the \ncomplaint on August 12, 2014. Applicant offered his resignation, but he was told to wait for \nthe college to complete its investigation. Applicant chose not to rebut the complaint, and \nadmitted during a pre-disciplinary hearing that he had engaged in flirtatious behavior with \nthe contract employee. At a meeting held in mid-September 2014 with his supervisor, \nApplicant again tendered his resignation and it was accepted.3 Applicant continued to work \nuntil October 17, 2014, the effective date of his resignation. He resigned from his \nemployment before the college completed its investigation, believing that he would be \ndischarged because he had been told that another incident would result in his termination. \nIn his opinion, any charge made by a female would have a negative result for him no \nmatter what he said or did, or whether it was accurate or not. (GE 3; Tr. 70-73.) \n \n \nApplicant filed for unemployment compensation and received benefits for the weeks \nending October 25, 2014, and November 1, 2014. On November 17, 2014, an \nadministrator for the state\u2019s employment security appeals division disqualified Applicant \nfrom unemployment compensation finding that Applicant had been discharged for willful \nmisconduct in the course of employment. Applicant appealed, and on December 29, 2014, \nan appeals referee found that Applicant had voluntarily left his position at the college, and \nthat he was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Applicant appealed the \ndecision of the referee. Although he admitted that he had flirted with the female contract \nemployee, he maintained that she initiated the contact and that their interactions were \nconsensual. The college\u2019s witness was unable to provide sufficient information about the \ncomplaint to establish that Applicant had engaged in any unwelcome sexual advances or \nthat he created a sexually objectionable environment. The Board of Review accepted \nApplicant\u2019s version of consensual flirtatious behavior and, on March 6, 2015, reversed the \ndenial of unemployment benefits. (GE 3; AE B; Tr. 74-76.) Applicant denies that he \ncommitted any sexual harassment and submits that the female contractor wrongly accused \nhim in an effort to get her job back. (Tr. 80.) \n \n \nApplicant was still unemployed when, on December 3, 2015, he completed and \ncertified to the accuracy of an SF 86 for his current employer. He listed his previous \nemployment at the college, and indicated, \u201cLeft by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct.\u201d He added, \u201cAccused of harassment for which I was absolved of \nany wrong-doing post-separation.\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to the following inquiries: \u201cIn \nthe last seven (7) years do you have another reason for leaving to report for this \nemployment?\u201d and \u201cFor this employment, in the last seven (7) years, have you received a \nwritten warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined, for misconduct in \nthe workplace, such as a violation of security policy?\u201d (GE 1.) Applicant began working for \nhis defense contractor employer on January 12, 2016. (GE 2; Tr. 35.) \n \n                                                 \n3 Applicant now denies that he offered to resign a second time. He testified that his supervisor came to him \nand told him that his resignation was accepted. (Tr. 79.) However, the board that reviewed his appeal of the \ndenial of unemployment benefits found that Applicant submitted his resignation again during a meeting with \nhis supervisor in mid-September 2014. (AE B.) \n\n7 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on March 3, 2016. Concerning the circumstances under which he left \nhis employment with the college, Applicant indicated that the college subcontracted \njanitorial services, and he was required to oversee the janitorial staff. Applicant explained \nthat a female janitor hired in the summer of 2014 had addressed him as \u201choney or Papi,\u201d \nand he had told her it was unacceptable and could not continue. After her work continued \nto suffer, he raised the issue of her work performance with her supervisor, and she was \nreplaced. Only then did she file a sexual harassment complaint against Applicant.4  \nApplicant explained that he offered his resignation because he knew that the college had a \nzero-tolerance policy. He considered himself to be absolved of all wrong doing after he \nprevailed in his appeal of the denial of unemployment benefits. Nonetheless, he was \nembarrassed by the incident, which he asserted was known about by his supervisor at the \ncollege, his neighbors, and his twin brother. The OPM investigator then asked him whether \nthere were any other issues involving his employment with the college to disclose, and he \nanswered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 2; Tr. 86.) \n \n \nOn April 26, 2016, Applicant was re-interviewed to discuss information developed \nafter his March interview concerning his record of disciplinary infractions at the college. \nApplicant did not dispute that he had been suspended three times. He claimed he did not \ndisclose the information because he did not know the specific dates of the suspensions \nand \u201cthought the best way for him to grow was to move on.\u201d He had not kept any records \nregarding his disciplinary issues and was unable to provide all the information required on \nhis case papers. Applicant then detailed that he had a conversation with \u201ca young lady\u201d \nabout dancing for which he was issued a verbal warning (not alleged in SOR). Regarding \nthe sexual harassment that led to his first suspension, Applicant explained that he was \nworking on inventory and handing tags to a student worker, who complained that he had \nlooked up her skirt. Applicant asserted it was physically impossible for him to have done so \nbecause he had neck issues,5 but he was suspended for two weeks. According to \nApplicant, he and the student worker had a flirtatious relationship. About his second \nsuspension, Applicant admitted that he had touched the hair of the subcontractor, but he \nasserted that the woman had laughed at the time. As for the incident that led him to resign \nfrom the college, the OPM investigator asked Applicant to address a complaint of the \nfemale contractor that he had asked her to clean his home. Applicant told the OPM \ninvestigator that he thought the woman might need the work. About general complaints \nfrom female staff at the college avoiding him because he had habit of asking them for \ndates, Applicant denied any validity to their claims. He explained that his friendliness was \nmistaken by some women who assumed there was more to it. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant was given an opportunity to review the summaries of his OPM interviews.6 \nOn October 16, 2017, he provided a detailed response in which he corrected some \ninaccuracies and offered some explanations. About his failure to disclose his employment \n                                                 \n4 Applicant testified similarly about the circumstances at his security clearance hearing. (Tr. 78-79.) \n \n5 Applicant submitted as AE J medical records from 1996 showing some damage to cervical discs. (AE J.) \n \n6 The signature page was not included in GE 2, so it is unclear when he responded to the interrogatories. \n\n8 \n \nsuspensions on his SF 86, Applicant indicated that he had destroyed all related records \n\u201cfollowing discharge from the employer,\u201d and did not think this employment history would \never be required in the future. Regarding the incidents themselves, Applicant indicated that \nenthusiasm about dancing should hardly be cause for verbal discipline. About student Ms. \nX\u2019s complaint that he had looked up her skirt during inventory, he denied that he had any \ninterest in that type of behavior and that he had ever made any sexual overtures toward \nthis student or other former co-workers. He added that even though the student worker \nknew that inventory work was scheduled and what it required, she showed up wearing a \nskirt. He asserted that he would have made a request for another co-worker to assist, but \nno one was available. Applicant explained that the incident of flicking a co-worker\u2019s ponytail \nwas innocent and not offensive to the female co-worker. About the August 2014 complaint, \nApplicant indicated that it involved him asking about house-cleaning services, and he \ninquired only because she had left business cards for such services in his office. Applicant \ndescribed himself as \u201ca friendly, gregarious person who apparently has his friendly \nintentions misinterpreted by others.\u201d (GE 2.) \n \n \nAt his hearing in March 2018, Applicant admitted his disciplinary record at the \ncollege. He attributed the incidents to him being an \u201cold-fashioned individual\u201d and to his \nlack of awareness that close proximity or a touch of an arm is considered offensive to \nsome persons. He denied any intention of untoward behavior and any intention to mislead \nduring the security clearance process. (Tr. 30-33.) \n \n \nApplicant found the need to isolate himself at his present job to avoid unintentionally \ncausing offense. (Tr. 32.) Within two months of his employment with the defense \ncontractor, he received \u201can informal written warning\u201d for inappropriately touching a young \nfemale on the hand. Applicant testified about the incident that, after a period of being \ncomfortable with her, he touched her on the hand as they were talking because he uses his \nhands expressively, or it was \u201cmaybe just totally unconscious sorts of interactions.\u201d \nApplicant denied realizing that the woman found his touch offensive until it was brought to \nhis attention at a meeting with human resources. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant received a second \nwritten warning early in 2018 for inappropriate physical contact with another co-worker. He \ndescribed the incident as follows: \n \nAnd then there was a second event earlier this year where one of my \nassociates that regularly plans my travel services and I were sitting side by \nside and we were working on some travel arrangements and I felt we were \ngood friends. And we were horsing around and then again, I had physical \ncontact with her that was unintentional and apparently somebody witnessed \nthat and filed a complaint on her behalf. . . .Allegedly, I touched her on the \nleg while we were sitting side by side. (Tr. 36-37.) \n \n \nApplicant denied any further incidents in his present job and added, \u201cAnd I want to \nunderscore that this young lady and I have regular interactions, consider ourselves friends. \nSo the whole thing came as a surprise to me.\u201d Applicant thought he was being extra-\ncareful, but he also admitted that he had felt \u201ca high degree of comfort around them.\u201d (Tr. \n\n9 \n \n36-38.) Applicant was required by his employer to watch a sexual harassment video. (Tr. \n88.) \n \n \nConcerning his failure to report on his SF 86 or discuss during his first OPM \ninterview that he had been disciplined by the college in 2009, 2010, and 2012, Applicant \ntestified in March 2018: \n \nAgain, as I shared earlier that I did not have any of the records that are \npresented here in this employee package that was secured from [the \ncollege]. And I would not have been able to have spoken accurately about \nany of those things. And at course at this point, I didn\u2019t know what to do. And \nsince the department representative was acting on your behalf, again I did \nnot know how to proceed. I didn\u2019t have anyone to ask to inquire what to do. \nAnd again, it wasn\u2019t for the sake of trying to hide anything. It just was a lack \nof information on my part. (Tr. 83.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not think at the time to look for the decisions of the \nstate\u2019s employment security appeals division (AEs A-B) that could have helped him recall \nthe details. He did not even remember that he had them until he was preparing for his \nsecurity clearance hearing and stumbled upon them in a box of old files. When asked to \nexplain his negative response to the investigator\u2019s inquiry about whether there were any \nother issues at the college to disclose, Applicant reiterated that it was a lack of knowledge \nand not for lack of disclosure. He did not want to \u201copen the door to something that [he] \ncouldn\u2019t provide all the details about.\u201d He had destroyed his records and tried to move on. \n(Tr. 83-87.) \n \nCharacter references \n \n \nApplicant presented character references from a neighbor and some church friends, \nwho attest to his voluntary, active involvement in the church\u2019s community outreach efforts.7 \nApplicant has been honest and trustworthy in his interactions with them. (AEs D-G.) The \nexecutive director of the church\u2019s outreach program indicated that Applicant has had good \nrelationships with other volunteers and with the people served by the program. (AE F.) A \npastor who has known Applicant for more than 30 years opined that Applicant has the \nhighest moral caliber and is entirely reliable. (AE I.) The neighbor, a licensed master social \nworker, indicates that Applicant shows good judgment and determination when presented \nwith a difficult task. Applicant has an \u201cold school\u201d personality in that he does not hesitate to \ncompliment others. However, the social worker also indicated that some people \u201ccould and \nmay interpret that kindness in a negative manner.\u201d In her opinion, Applicant \u201cis always \nsincere and caring along with personable and professional at all times.\u201d  She has trusted \nApplicant with sensitive information, and she has had no issues about his ability to keep \nsensitive matters to himself. (AE G.) A longtime friend, who met Applicant 32 years ago \nthrough their interactions as church youth counselors, indicates that Applicant cannot be \n                                                 \n7 It is unclear to what extent, if any, the character references are aware of the issues concerning Applicant\u2019s \nemployment at the college, since none mention any issues. \n\n10 \n \ncoerced into committing a wrong act. In this friend\u2019s opinion, Applicant is very patriotic. (AE \nH.) \n \n \nA former co-worker in the college\u2019s distance learning department attests that \nApplicant performed his duties reliably and effectively. He worked to maintain relationships \nwith vendors and keep contractual agreements current. He was also trustworthy with \nregard to confidentiality requirements. (AE C.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n\n11 \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nEven when viewed in a light most favorable to Applicant, the evidence establishes \nthe security concerns underlying AG \u00b6 15. Applicant was suspended by his then employer, \na college, for ten days without pay in July 2009 for violating the college\u2019s sexual \nharassment policy. He behaved inappropriately toward a 20-year-old student worker over \nthe previous two years and conducted himself inappropriately while performing inventory. \nIn August 2010, he was suspended for five days, again for violating the college\u2019s sexual \nharassment policy after he inappropriately touched the hair of a female cleaning contractor \nin June 2010. He was suspended by the college for ten days for having inappropriate \ncommunications with a 17-year-old student in December 2012 concerning his search for a \nUkrainian wife and expressing to the student that he would have liked to have dated her if \nhe was younger. In August 2014, Applicant engaged in what he termed as flirtatious \nbehavior with a cleaning contractor, but she filed a complaint with the college of unwanted \ninteractions with him that he has discrepantly explained were in response to her flirtatious \nbehavior toward him and in retaliation for her losing her job. He resigned from his \nemployment believing he would be discharged because he had been repeatedly warned by \nhis then employer to avoid personal conversations with female staff. The evidentiary record \nis not very detailed with regard to the unwanted and inappropriate conversations that led \nthe college to suspend Applicant on three separate occasions. Even so, his record of \nfailing to conform his behavior to workplace requirements implicates disqualifying condition \nAG \u00b6 16(d), which states: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n\n12 \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified his December 2015 SF 86 by \nresponding negatively to an employment inquiry concerning whether he had received any \nwritten warnings, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in \nthe workplace in the last seven years. A reasonable inference of deliberate falsification \ncould be inferred because he was suspended three times from his employment at the \ncollege before the 2014 incident that factored into his decision to resign from his job. \nApplicant denies any intention to mislead, claiming that he answered \"no\u201d to the SF 86 \ninquiry because he did not have the details of the suspensions, including the specific dates \nand circumstance that led to him being suspended. He had destroyed his copy of his \ndisciplinary record at the college, and did not recollect that he had kept the decisions of the \nstate\u2019s employment security appeals division on his unemployment claims that contained \nrelevant and material information about his employment discipline. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n  \nApplicant disclosed on his SF 86 that he left the employment of the college after \naccusations of sexual harassment for which he was absolved. In reversing the denial of \nunemployment benefits to him in March 2015, a state review board made a finding that \nApplicant engaged in consensual, flirtatious behavior with the female cleaning contractor \nwho lodged the August 2014 sexual harassment complaint. During his March 2016 \ninterview with the OPM investigator, he explained that he took the \u201cappeal adjudicator\u2019s \ncomment regarding the unwarranted discharge as being absolved of any wrongdoing after \nhe left the company.\u201d \n \nNothing about the review board\u2019s decision could reasonably be read as vitiating his \nprevious work suspensions or absolving him from all misconduct in the previous incidents \nthat led to his suspension on three separate occasions. Applicant\u2019s SF 86 representation \nthat he had been absolved of all wrongdoing, coupled with his negative response to the \ndiscipline question on his SF 86, leave an inaccurate impression about his employment at \n\n13 \n \nthe college. His credibility on this issue is also undermined by his lack of candor during his \nMarch 2016 interview when, after discussing the circumstances in 2014 that led him to \nresign from his employment at the college, he falsely denied that he had any other issues \nat that employment.8 Applicant knew he had been suspended. He was able to recall some \ndetails about the circumstances underlying the suspensions when he was re-interviewed in \nApril 2016.  Applicant\u2019s desire to move on from the problems at the college and to avoid \nhaving to discuss them does not justify his knowing omission of his work suspensions from \nhis SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. It provides: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is also established. Sexual harassment or unwelcome flirtatious behavior \nis conduct that, if known, could affect a person\u2019s professional, or community standing. It is \nunclear to what extent his current employer and his friends, including his church \nacquaintances and friends, know about his disciplinary issues at the college. Applicant \ndemonstrated a willingness to conceal his disciplinary record in response to legitimate \ninquiries during the security clearance process. He indicated during his March 2016 \ninterview that the 2014 incident was embarrassing to him. AG \u00b6 16(e) provides: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n                                                 \n8Applicant\u2019s knowing false statement to the interviewer could have been disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(b), but it \nwas not alleged. AG \u00b6 16(b) provides: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical or mental health professional involved in making a recommendation \nrelevant to a national security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative. \n \nConduct not alleged can still be considered for other purposes, such as assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility and factors in mitigation. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal \nBoard listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive \nSection 6.3. \n\n14 \n \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the \npotentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Five of the seven disqualifying conditions \nwarrant some consideration and could potentially apply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant had an opportunity to correct the SF 86 \nfalsification about the employment discipline imposed by the college during his March 2016 \ninterview. Instead, he falsely denied that he had any other issues at that employment. AG \u00b6 \n17(c) has limited applicability in that some of the accusations made against him by female \nco-workers, which factored into one or more of his suspensions, were not particularly \negregious. A state appeals referee considered some of the comments that factored into \nApplicant\u2019s suspension in August 2010 to have been harmless and not harassment, such \nas the comment to a then co-worker that she had nice feet. \n \nHowever, the appeals referee also indicated that Applicant\u2019s intentional contact with \nthe hair of the female contractor in 2010 violated the proper boundaries between the \nsubcontractor and Applicant, who was in a position to affect her livelihood. Had the college \nsuspended Applicant after that incident, the referee would have denied unemployment \nbenefits for Applicant. Applicant\u2019s sexual harassment may not have been particularly \negregious, but he does not deny that he flirted with female co-workers (some decades \nyounger) after he had been told to avoid personal, non-work related communications. His \nrepeated inability or unwillingness to maintain an appropriate separation between work and \npersonal matters is viewed seriously. He was suspended from the college in July 2009 for \nsexual harassment involving a 20-year-old student. After being warned that any further \ninappropriate behavior with female staff members would result in more severe disciplinary \naction, he had inappropriate physical contact with a female contactor in 2010. He made a \n17-year-old student uncomfortable in December 2012 by his conversations about dating \nand looking for a wife. Regarding the August 2014 complaints made by a subcontract \n\n15 \n \nfemale cleaning employee, it is noted that the state review board was provided no evidence \nto counter Applicant\u2019s assertion that he and the complainant engaged in consensual, \nflirtatious behavior. Whether or not Applicant believed that his comments would not be \nunwelcomed by the cleaning contractor, he exercised poor judgment by engaging in \nflirtatious behavior with her after he had been told by his employer to avoid such behavior. \nMore recently, in December 2015, Applicant certified to the accuracy of his SF 86 \nstatements after being informed in writing that a knowing and willful false statement could \nbe punished by a fine or imprisonment or both under Title 18, Section 1001, of the United \nStates Code. His false response to the employment discipline question constituted criminal \nconduct that raises serious concerns about his judgment and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant has not shown adequate reform under AG \u00b6 17(d), either of his \ninappropriate conduct with female co-workers or of his SF 86 falsification. He has yet to \nmeaningfully acknowledge his responsibility for his personal conduct. Despite his \nmandatory completion of EAP counseling and sexual harassment training, he blames the \nstudent worker for the 2009 inventory incident, claiming that they had a flirtatious \nrelationship, and she arrived for work wearing a skirt, despite knowing the requirements of \ninventory work. He shows little recognition of the fact that he violated the boundaries that \nhe had to maintain because he was in a position to affect the livelihood of the female \ncontractors in the 2010 and 2014 incidents. Perhaps most significantly going forward, he \nhas been disciplined twice by his current employer for similar concerns involving female co-\nworkers, most recently in early 2018 for improperly touching a female co-worker\u2019s knee \nwhile sitting beside her. Applicant is seemingly incapable of understanding the effects of \nhis personal behavior on his co-workers. Regarding his SF 86 omission, Applicant shows \nlittle reform by continuing to assert that his omission was somehow justified because he did \nnot have the records of his suspensions. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 17(e), Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to detail his work \nsuspensions and the conduct that led to the disciplinary action to friends and associates \nthat may have no legitimate need to know. At that same time, he has admitted that the \n2014 complaint that led to his resignation is embarrassing for him. Even taking Applicant at \nhis word that his brother and neighbors know about the 2014 incident, it is not clear that \nthey know about his earlier suspensions. None of his character references commented \nabout the suspensions, although a neighbor indicated that Applicant\u2019s friendliness and \nkindness could be interpreted by some in a negative manner. Issues of vulnerability are \nminimized somewhat, however, because the Government is aware of some of the details \nabout his personal conduct involving female former and present co-workers and \ncontactors. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) has minimal applicability. It is unclear whether Applicant committed \nsexual harassment of the cleaning contractor in August 2014. She complained that \nApplicant came onto her and invited her into his home. Applicant has variously asserted \nthat he flirted with her in response to her advances because he was flattered by her \nattention, but also that he told her it was inappropriate to call him honey and she filed an \nunfounded sexual harassment complaint in an effort to regain her job. He exercised \nquestionable personal judgment, given he was in a position to affect her livelihood, and he \n\n16 \n \nhad been told not to engage female co-workers in personal conversations. For the reasons \nnoted, Applicant\u2019s personal conduct remains a security concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).9 Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under \nGuideline E, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work for the college was competent and in some aspects superior. He is \nwell regarded by his neighbors, church friends, and church clergy. Yet, it is well settled that \nonce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Sexual harassment can substantially interfere \nwith a person\u2019s work performance or create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work \nenvironment. Unwanted comments or inappropriate behavior at the workplace need not \nmeet the legal definition of sexual harassment to engender security concerns. In that \nregard, Applicant\u2019s record of suspensions in his previous employment and his discipline in \nhis present job for inappropriate behavior toward female co-workers cast serious doubt \nabout his current security worthiness. His lack of candor about his disciplinary record when \ncompleting his SF 86 reflects an unacceptable tendency to act in self-interest and creates \nsignificant doubt about whether the Government can rely on his representations. After \nconsidering all the evidence, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                                                 \n9 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n17 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information in a public trust position is \ndenied. \n Statement of the Case \nOn January 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) effective within the DOD for \nSORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR on February 16, 2018, and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 16, \n2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \non November 20, 2018, scheduling the hearing on December 4, 2018. I conducted the \n01/24/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing as scheduled and Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 5 were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A - O were also admitted without objection. I left the \nrecord open until January 14, 2019, for the parties to submit supplemental \ndocumentation. (Tr. 71) Department Counsel submitted a supplemental credit report \ndated January 15, 2019. This was marked as GE 6 and admitted without objection. \nApplicant did not submit post-hearing documents during this period. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 2, 2019. \n \n \n \n                      \n \n  \nApplicant is 41 years old. She obtained a general equivalency diploma (GED) in \n2003 and had some college courses. She was married in 2010, and she has four \nchildren, ages 16, 18, 20, and 27. (Tr. 64-66) The three youngest children reside with \nApplicant and she also provides for her 1 \u00bd year-old grandson. Applicant\u2019s husband is \nincarcerated and has provided no child support. She reports no military service. She \nhas been working as a customer-service advocate in a position of trust at a federal \nhealth-care provider since December 2016, with no problems. (Tr. 64, 99) Applicant was \nunemployed for a period of eight or nine months when she had two back surgeries in \n2014-2016. (Tr. 80) After she submitted a worker\u2019s compensation claim to a previous \nemployer, she was terminated. (Tr. 95)  \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied most of the alleged delinquent debts \nplaced for collections, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h through 1.l. The \nalleged delinquent debts total $29,221. In addition to the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nApplicant has three charged-off delinquencies, and eight consumer or medical debts \nplaced for collection. She claims in her answer that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f is \ndisputed. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she used a template obtained on the internet and sent \nseveral letters to creditors by certified mail requesting validation of her various debts \npursuant to the Fair Debt Collections Procedure Act (FDCPA). (Tr. 15, AE N) She sent \ncertified letters to the creditor corporation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g requesting validations \nregarding two accounts placed for collection. (AE C and D) The creditor responded with \na June 14, 2018, letter that said Applicant\u2019s request for validation was not specific \nenough and it was frivolous. (AE E) Applicant also sent three letters requesting \nvalidation to the medical creditor at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k. (Tr. 30-31) That creditor \nresponded with a letter validating the debts and confirming the amounts owed. (AE H)   \n \n \nApplicant testified she had a telephone conversation August 10, 2018, with \nConstance, who assured her that all of the accounts for medical debts with the creditor \nat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k would be removed within 30 days. The creditor was supposedly \nunable to validate these debts as requested by Applicant. (Tr. 36-38, AE I) The letter \nfrom this creditor to Applicant concerning a debt for $159 contains a handwritten \nannotation by Applicant about the conversation with Constance. (AE I) That \nconversation followed Applicant\u2019s June 30, 2018 letter to the medical creditor requesting \nvalidation. Another similar letter referred to a $22 debt owed to the same creditor. (Tr. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n45-47) SOR \u00b6\u00b61.j and 1.k are for medical debts, which the creditor validated and \nconfirmed in a response to Applicant\u2019s letter. (Tr. 74, AE M)    \n \nApplicant waived her requisite 15-days\u2019 notice at the outset of the hearing as the \nnotice of hearing was dated November 20, 2018, for a December 4, 2018 hearing. (Tr. \n7-8, 39) The record was left open until January 14, 2019, specifically so that Applicant \ncould provide follow-up documentation showing that these medical debts were removed \nfrom her credit report. (Tr. 39, 42) She also expressed an interest in consulting with an \nattorney during the interim. (Tr. 42) She produced no supplemental documentation or \nnotice of appearance from an attorney. However, department counsel produced an \nupdated credit report dated January 15, 2019, post-hearing. This was admitted without \nobjection. The medical debts alleged in the SOR do not appear on this updated credit \nreport. (GE 6)  \n \nApplicant testified that the judgment alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a in the amount of \n$6,079 is the result of her eviction from her home in 2013. (Tr. 55) The judgment was \nentered against Applicant in June 2013. (GE 2, 4) Applicant testified that she called the \nproperty-management company in an effort to compromise this judgment, to no avail. \n(Tr. 56) She also claims that she called the court where the judgment was entered, but \nshe produced no documentation addressing her efforts to compromise this judgment or \npay it off.  \n \nThe charged-off debt in the amount of $8,294 alleged in SOR \u00b61.b was for an \nautomobile loan, which Applicant co-signed with her daughter. Applicant admits it is a \nvalid debt. (Tr. 56) Her daughter stopped making payments and the vehicle was \nrepossessed after the daughter\u2019s boyfriend used it in a high-speed chase while fleeing \nfrom police. (Tr. 57-58) SOR \u00b61.c is also for an automobile repossession in March 2018. \n(Tr. 59) This account was opened in August 2015. (GE 3) Applicant\u2019s husband bought \nher a car for her birthday. Then, he lost his job and stopped making payments. \nApplicant disputed this debt and the creditor has removed this debt from her credit \nreport by a June 2, 2018 letter. (AE J)   \n \n \nApplicant testified that she also purchased a used car, which turned out to be a \nlemon, and this resulted in the debt placed for collection in the amount of $4,010 at \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 60) The vehicle had a cracked engine block that the dealer refused to \nfix. So, she stopped making payments and it was also repossessed. (Tr. 60) SOR \u00b6 1.e \nand 1.f arose from Applicant\u2019s supposedly fraudulent personal loans, in the amount of \n$1,740 and $589, obtained from the same lender. (Tr. 61) Applicant never received the \nmoney promised from these personal loans and she has requested validation. (Tr. 91) \nShe has contacted somebody named \u201cBaby\u201d who is supposed to validate these debts. \n(Tr. 62) The debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.e was sold to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Her most \nrecent credit report reflect a zero balance owed on these accounts and states \u201cpaid and \nsold.\u201d (GE 6) \n \n \nApplicant testified she has not reached out to contact the creditor in SOR 1.g \nconcerning the past-due debt in the amount of $79. (Tr. 61-63) She simply has no extra \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmoney as a single mother feeding and housing four children and a grandson on her \nsalary of $11.78 per hour. (Tr. 95)  SOR \u00b61.h is a delinquent medical debt in the amount \nof $545. Again, Applicant testified that she asked the creditor for validation. (Tr. 68) The \ncreditor produced a letter in response dated August 28, 2018, which validated the debt \nand confirmed the amount. (AE H) SOR \u00b61.i is a delinquent debt in the amount of $538 \nresulting from Applicant\u2019s cancelled automobile insurance. She testified that she has not \nreached out to the creditor or taken any action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 73) She does \nnot know anything about the medical debt for $18 in SOR \u00b61.l. (Tr. 75)  \n \n \nAppellant testified that she earns $1,600 a month after taxes and she does have \nsome semblance of a budget. (Tr. 82) She has no residuary income after paying \nexpenses. Her rent is $560 per month and she receives no general assistance except \nfor her subsidized housing. (Tr. 86-87) She had no financial counseling beyond the \ncredit-builder\u2019s information publicly available on the internet. (Tr. 81) Applicant also \nowes over $100,000 in student loans for which she received a hardship deferral, \naccording to her most recent credit report. (GE 6) It is unclear how she will ever repay \nthem. She provided no evidence of any repayment plans with her remaining creditors or \nperformance evaluations from her employer. She provided two very positive character \nreferences from co-workers attesting to her work ethic, trustworthiness and honesty. \n(AE A \u2013 B) One noted that Applicant turned in approximately $10,000 dollars that was \napparently stolen in a robbery and hidden in a commode in their workplace.              \n  \n \n \n         \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the government\u2019s exhibits support the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR total approximately $29,221. The \ngovernment exhibits admitted at the hearing, and post-hearing supplemental \ndocuments, together with Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony substantiate these \ndebts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant provided testimony and documentation to show that she successfully \ndisputed or satisfied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. \n  \n \n \nIntentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct 23, 2013). Applicant sought a financial hardship deferral of her substantial \n\n \n7 \n \n \nstudent loan debts. They have not been removed from her credit report. Otherwise, she \nproduced limited documentation sent to her creditors, requesting validation of her \nvarious delinquencies. While Applicant did not deny that she incurred these debts, she \ndid not provide documentation to show payments or progress on resolving any \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. \n \n \n \n The delinquencies alleged in the SOR are longstanding and ongoing. Applicant\u2019s \nsurgeries and period of unemployment were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, but \nshort-lived. She has not demonstrated that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She provided no evidence of financial counseling (beyond the internet), \nor good-faith efforts to repay a judgment, student loans, or other creditors to show that \nher financial problems have been resolved and are under control. The mitigating \nconditions enumerated above apply only partially except for \u00b6 20(e) in connection with \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f.  \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Applicant is the mother of four children and she \ncares for her grandson. She has endured medical setbacks and a brief period of \nunemployment and struggled to raise a family as a single mother.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a trustworthiness concern. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f:               For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a,1.b,1.d,1.g -1.l:            Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a  \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n                                                      Robert J.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 4, 2014. On \nAugust 11, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline M, use of information technology and Guideline E, personal conduct. The DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided a four-page response to the SOR on September 1, 2017, denying \nall of the SOR allegations and including a two-page typed explanation of events. Applicant \nalso requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 3, 2018. On December 3, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n02/22/2019\n\n2 \n \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for December 20, 2018. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 4 were admitted into evidence without objection. I left \nthe record open until January 15, 2019, for Department Counsel and Applicant to provide \nany post-hearing documents. On January 10, 2019, Applicant provided an e-mail with three \nattachments: the court disposition from his step-son\u2019s incident; a recent Questionnaire for \nPublic Trust Position (SF-85); and a recent Declaration for Federal Employment. These \nwere marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A\u2013C respectively and admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel asked to leave the record open for an additional week and I granted \nher request over Applicant\u2019s objection. An e-mail chain marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 \nreflects the back-and-forth colloquy. At the hearing, Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nbut submitted no documentation. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 4, 2019.  \n \n Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1991 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2002. (Tr. 10-12) Applicant was married in 1992, divorced in 2006, and he \nremarried in 2009. He reports two children and two stepchildren from his wife\u2019s first \nmarriage. He previously served as a police officer in a small town from 1995 to 2002. \nApplicant has been employed as an information technology (IT) professional by a federal \ncontractor since September 2015. Applicant reports no military service, and he has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2006. (Tr. 18-20) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges under Guideline M that in 2015, Applicant violated his employer\u2019s \ninformation protection acceptable-use policy by viewing child-pornography images on his \ncompany\u2019s laptop computer. A second allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a asserts that Applicant was \nterminated from his employment on August 20, 2015, as a result. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that \nApplicant failed to disclose this derogatory information during an interview on December \n19, 2016, with an authorized investigator for DOD. SOR \u00b6 2.c cross-alleges the same \nmisconduct under SOR \u00b6 1.a and raises a concern under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe basis for these allegations is an August 19, 2015 letter of termination from the vice \npresident of his company (GE 4), and Applicant\u2019s answers to interrogatories dated July 31, \n2017, with an attached two-page statement clarifying the summary of his personal subject \ninterview (PSI) conducted by an authorized investigator on December 19, 2016 (GE 3).  \n \nApplicant was terminated from his employment by a previous federal contractor on \nAugust 19, 2015. (Tr. 21) He testified that he was called in by his supervisors in June 2015, \nand told that inappropriate images had been found on his work laptop computer. Applicant \nadmitted he had viewed adult pornography on this laptop. They took his laptop away and \nprovided him with another loaner laptop. (Tr. 34) Applicant was called in again on August \n19, 2015. He vehemently denied ever downloading, accessing, or viewing child \npornography-images on his work laptop computer. (Tr. 45) He did not ever see the offensive \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s June 4, 2014 security \nclearance application (SCA) (GE 1).  \n \n\n3 \n \nimages obtained by his employer, but was told that his laptop contained inappropriate \nimages. He was terminated after 13 \u00bd years with that employer, and he did not appeal. (Tr. \n45) Applicant had taken computer-security courses and training and he knew that the \ncompany prohibited viewing adult pornography on work computers. (Tr. 50, 83)  \n \nApplicant lived with his wife and four children in 2015. Local police obtained and \nexecuted a search warrant at his house in March 2016 seeking evidence of a computer \ncrime. (Tr. 36) Since the internet service provider (ISP) subscription at that address was in \nApplicant\u2019s name, he was interviewed first by the police. He vehemently denied viewing or \ndownloading child-pornography images on his laptop computer. When Applicant\u2019s 17-year-\nold stepson was interviewed separately, he admitted downloading the compressed files of \npornographic images of his minor girlfriend on his computer. (Tr. 39, AE A) The stepson \nwent to court and pled guilty to a reduced charge of computer harassment. He was \nsentenced to two years of probation and therapy, which he completed, and the conviction \nwas expunged. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant never gave anybody else his password or computer \naccess card (CAC) card to access his work laptop computer. (Tr. 43)  \n \nIn a December 19, 2016, personal subject interview (PSI), a clearance interviewer \nwent through the various sections of Applicant\u2019s June 2014 SCA and asked Applicant \nquestions. Applicant told her that he voluntarily resigned from his employment in 2015 \nbecause he did not like the contract. (Tr. 56) Applicant testified that this was a snap decision \nand he lied to her because he was embarrassed. Applicant wholeheartedly regrets this and \nthe ensuing falsifications in sections 13 (c) (employment record) and 27 (use of information \ntechnology systems) of the same SCA. (Tr. 57) Applicant was not forthcoming with the \nclearance interviewer about derogatory information in his background. Applicant testified \nthat he viewed adult pornography on his work laptop for three years starting in 2012, and \nhe last viewed adult pornography in 2015. (Tr. 77, 81)  \n \n \n \n                                     Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is \nan examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing of a number of variables of an \nindividual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the individual is an acceptable \nsecurity risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \n \nThe Concern. Failure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness \nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. \nInformation Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, or wireless \ndevice used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, protect, or move \ninformation. This includes any component, whether integrated into a larger \nsystem or not, such as hardware, software, or firmware, used to enable or \nfacilitate these operations.2 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6 40: \n \n          (e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not authorized. \n                                                          \n2 AG \u00b6 39. \n\n5 \n \n \nApplicant has admitted in his response to the SOR that he improperly downloaded \npornography onto his work computer without authorization and in violation of his employer\u2019s \nIT policy. This meets the government\u2019s burden in establishing application of the above-\nmentioned disqualifying conditions, and shifts the focus to potentially mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 41(a) could potentially mitigate the use of information technology concerns: \n \nso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened    \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant viewed pornographic images on his work laptop computer for three years \nfrom 2012 to 2015. Applicant testified credibly that he has refrained from this behavior for \nalmost four years. He is contrite and he has been punished by this former employer when \nhe was terminated and unemployed for a period. However, he was not forthcoming with the \nclearance interviewer about the termination. He told her he voluntarily resigned because \nhe did not like the contract. He repeatedly violated his employer\u2019s IT policy by viewing the \npornography. Under the circumstances, I am not convinced that this violation and lapse in \njudgment won\u2019t recur in the future.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n. \n           The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or  \n            omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator \n            security official, competent medical or mental health professional, involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility              \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n     \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \n         I find that the evidence and testimony presented, implicate AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (b) and \n16 (f). Applicant acknowledges having computer training with the company and being \n\n6 \n \naware of his company\u2019s zero-tolerance policy for downloading pornography on \ncompany computers, and he admits to violating it. Moreover, Applicant was terminated \nby his employer for this behavior. He exacerbated matters by failing to disclose the truth \nabout his termination from his employer in 2015 to the clearance investigator.  \n \n \n Conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could potentially mitigate security concerns \ninclude: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nMy analysis under adjudicative guideline M above, is the same under this this \nadministrative guideline E and is herein incorporated by reference. Applicant lied to the \nclearance investigator in December 2016 about his termination. He has not been \ncandid and forthright throughout the security clearance process. Insufficient time has \npassed to conclude that his misconduct in viewing pornography and his falsifications \nto the investigator occurred under unique circumstances and are not likely to recur. \nApplicant has taken positive steps to acknowledge his mistakes, and he no longer \nviews pornography but he has not had counseling. The mitigating conditions above do \nnot apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \n\n7 \n \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines M and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant has a demonstrated record of over \n20 years of service in law enforcement and as a federal contractor with a security clearance.  \nHe is a father of two children and two stepchildren. Most importantly, Applicant deliberately \ndeceived the clearance investigator about his reason for leaving employment in 2015. He \nhas not met his burden of persuasion.  \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant has violated the company\u2019s \nrules, regulations, policies or procedures pertaining to use of IT, and that he lied about it to \nthe investigator. He has not met his burden of persuasion. I am not convinced that these \nwere isolated incidents. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guidelines M and E.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:                     \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                       AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c:    \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n             Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.

I was assigned the case on May 10, 2018.  \nA notice was issued on June 19, 2018, setting the hearing for August 23, 2018. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled, during which time the Government offered six \nexhibits (Exs.), noted as Exs. 1-6, plus two hearing exhibits (HE), accepted as HE 1-2. \nApplicant rendered testimony relevant to the case. On September 4, 2018, post-hearing \nsubmissions from Applicant were accepted into the record without objection as Exs. A-\nB. The record was then closed. In the interim, the transcript (Tr.) was received on \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/21/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nSeptember 4, 2018. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old mother of two children in their mid-20s. She has been \nserving as a system controller for the same defense contractor for over a year and a \nhalf. Applicant has earned an associate\u2019s degree. She served on active duty in the \nUnited States military honorably from 1989 through 1996, where she maintained a \nsecurity clearance without incident. Upon discharge, she returned to her home state \nwith plans to start college. Instead, she started to work.  \n \n \nIn 2004, friends encouraged Applicant to seek a contractor job abroad, which she \ndid. From there, she served multiple employers over the year, often in lateral moves \nrather than promotions. Her current position, accepted in 2017, was a lateral move. \nDuring this time, she enjoyed the freedom of quick trips to neighboring regions as a \ntourist. She enjoyed this life. Overtime, debt was acquired while most of her accounts \nand obligations were left to her family in the United States to manage for her. (Tr. 37). \n \n \nAt issue in the SOR are eight allegations concerning delinquent debts, 1.a-1.1.h, \nrepresenting approximately $51,000. Much of her debt delinquency dates to about \n2013, when there was an interruption of payments on her accounts despite sufficient \nincome to honor her obligations. (Tr. 37-38, 41) This while family members managed \nher bill on her behalf. Applicant admits two debts owed to a credit union (SOR allegation \n1.a-1.b) representing approximately $36,591.2 Applicant said she has made \u201ca couple\u201d \nof payments toward this debt, but provided no documentary evidence to that effect. (Tr. \n48) After the hearing, however, she provided documentation reflecting confirmation of \nprescheduled monthly payments in the amount of $200 to begin two months after the \nhearing. (Ex. A-B) No copy of the referenced agreement was attached.   \n \nThere is also one account debt owed to a collection agency for a lender Applicant \ndoes not recognize from 2016 (SOR allegation 1.c) for $4,421. She presented no \ndocumentary evidence regarding this account, although the Government\u2019s credit reports \nsuggest it may be in repayment. (Tr. 28). After the hearing, Applicant wrote that she had \nbeen in contact with this entity and worked on a repayment schedule, but provided no \ndocumentary evidence indicating any action had been taken or any documented \npayments had yet been paid.  \n \nThe majority of the delinquent debt alleged is credit card debt, but the SOR also \nreflects debts related to state taxes and medical balances. Of the medical debts (SOR \nallegations 1.d., 1.g), Applicant does not recognize the first debt, but suggests it could \nbe for care given to her daughter. She contacted her former insurer, which she has not \nused in several years, and it did not recognize her or her membership number. (Tr. 31) \n                                                          \n2 Applicant does not recall the account at 1.b, but notes family members had power of attorney and that \nshe had what he believed was a smaller second account with this entity. (Tr. 45-48) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nShe offered to pay the $218 at issue in 2017, but her offer was declined. (Tr. 29-30) She \nexperienced the same problem addressing a second medical debt for $570. \n \nThe tax liability (SOR allegations 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h) was mostly acquired due to \nmishap, as the state taxing authority had been sending Applicant notices of tax liability \nto an incorrect address for at least a year. (Tr. 23) Once discovered, Applicant had her \nfamily make the necessary address correction for her while she was abroad. Applicant \nnow manages the situation overseas via the Internet. Those debts, amounting to about \n$8,580, were satisfied in January 2017. (Ex. 6; Tr. 24) In about 2016, she received word \na garnishment had been attached to her pay. (Tr. 61) By that point, Applicant took over \nmanagement of all her debts. (Tr. 53) \n \nApplicant is presently in charge of her finances and able to honor her daily \nexpenses under a manageable budget (Tr. 58-59) One child is about to graduate from \ncollege and \u201cprobably\u201d be independent financially. (Tr. 54) Applicant\u2019s mother has since \npassed away, so there is no parental financial assistance extended by Applicant. \nApplicant has had telephonic financial counseling from abroad and is expecting to \nreceive a session in person in the near future. \n                                               \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance-related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue, some dating back to 2013. It \nappears her initial buildup of delinquent debt was the result of inaction by her family, to \nwhom she had entrusted the maintenance of her accounts and affairs during the many \nyears while she lived abroad. When she discovered there was a problem, she \nimmediately had them give the state tax entity her current address and began \ncontrolling the situation herself by Internet. She then assumed control of all of her \naccounts in the same way, shifting the obligation for her accounts to herself through the \never increasingly ubiquitous Internet technology. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant has received telephonic financial counseling, taken control of her state \ntax situation, and apparently tried to repay the two smaller medical accounts. She \ntestified orally that payments on the medical accounts were actively refused by the \ninsurer because they no longer had information on her or the balances. The lion\u2019s share \nof her remaining delinquent debt (approximately $37,000 of $51,000), and the related \nsecurity concerns, remain in the form of the notably large credit card balances.  \n \nApplicant apparently made arrangements to make monthly $200 payments \ntoward the debts at 1.a and 1.b, but not until well after the hearing was adjourned. No \ncopy of the underlying financial arrangement was offered. There is scant documentation \nwith regard to what she has done or plans to do with regard to the debt from 1.c. The \nsubstantial financial balances owed and the last-minute efforts regarding these debts \nare not insignificant, and they limit complete application of AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the her \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those \nfactors. I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old system controller who has worked for the same \ncontractor for over a year and a half. She served in the military honorably on active duty \nfrom 1989 through 1996, and worked abroad as a defense contractor since about 2004. \nApplicant is the mother of two grown children. Until a few years ago, her family based in \nthe United States monitored her affairs and financial contractors on her behalf.  \n \nAt issue in this case is approximately $51,000, of which, nearly $37,000 concerns \ntwo recognized commercial credit card balances. When first aware she owed state \ndelinquent taxes that had gone unnoticed because the state did not have her most \ncurrent contact address, Applicant had her family correct the address confusion and she \n\n \n \n \n \n6\npersonally made sure the arrearage of about $8,500 was satisfied in January 2017. She \nhas also tried to pay the delinquent debts to a former medical provider amounting to \nalmost $800, but the provider is said to have refused payment because neither the \naccounts nor Applicant are in its records. No documentary evidence was provided \nconcerning what Applicant has since identified as a commercial debt of about $4,000, \nalthough she indicated she has spoken with the entity. \n \nThat leaves the approximately $37,000 owed to her former commercial credit \ncard. After the hearing, Applicant forwarded copies of paperwork showing she had \nmade arrangements for future monthly $200 payments on a referenced, but not offered, \nrepayment arrangement. While this suggests effort, no complete documentation has \nbeen offered to show a full repayment package has been finalized and implemented, \nnor is there evidence that such action was commenced before the SOR was issued.  \n \nThis process does not demand that an applicant pay all of one\u2019s delinquent \ndebts. It does, however, expect an applicant to describe a workable and manageable \nagreement and demonstrate by documentary evidence that a meaningful track record of \ntimely and notable payment has been established. Here, with regard to the \noverwhelming majority of the delinquent debt at issue, Applicant simply waited too late \nto enact the appropriate steps to provide documentation that the brunt of her debt has \nbeen brought under control. In light of the above, I find that at this time, Applicant\u2019s \nefforts and documentation fail to mitigate financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since December 2015. She attended college for a period without earning a degree. She is married for the third time, but she and her husband have been separated for more than ten years. She has two adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 30- 32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) Applicant has a history of criminal behavior, primarily related to substance abuse. She started smoking marijuana in about 1978 while in high school. She continued periodically using marijuana until about 2014. She told a background investigator in September 2016 that she smoked marijuana on a weekly basis, off and on, from 1978 until she stopped smoking marijuana in 2014. She was interviewed again in May 2017, and provided similar information. She stated that she did not use marijuana at all between 1992 and 1995, and then smoked marijuana, with some breaks of weeks or months, until 2014. In her response to the SOR, she wrote that she stopped using marijuana in 1984, and then resumed after decades of abstinence \u201cfor medicinal purposes only\u201d for her bad back. She testified that she only smoked marijuana occasionally, maybe once every year or two with her friends, with her most recent use in about 2012. She later testified that her marijuana use varied from about once a month to about once every two to three months, with a period of abstinence of about eight to nine years. (Tr. at 25-28",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 10, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E, F, H, and \nJ. Applicant responded to the SOR on August 28, 2017, and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 18, 2017, she changed \nher request to a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me \non May 23, 2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non June 18, 2019, scheduling the hearing for July 11, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and called her son as a witness. She submitted documents \n\n \n2 \n \nwith her response to the SOR that will be considered, but she did not submit any \nadditional documents at her hearing.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since December 2015. She attended college for a period without \nearning a degree. She is married for the third time, but she and her husband have been \nseparated for more than ten years. She has two adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 30-\n32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \n \nApplicant has a history of criminal behavior, primarily related to substance abuse. \nShe started smoking marijuana in about 1978 while in high school. She continued \nperiodically using marijuana until about 2014. She told a background investigator in \nSeptember 2016 that she smoked marijuana on a weekly basis, off and on, from 1978 \nuntil she stopped smoking marijuana in 2014. She was interviewed again in May 2017, \nand provided similar information. She stated that she did not use marijuana at all \nbetween 1992 and 1995, and then smoked marijuana, with some breaks of weeks or \nmonths, until 2014. In her response to the SOR, she wrote that she stopped using \nmarijuana in 1984, and then resumed after decades of abstinence \u201cfor medicinal \npurposes only\u201d for her bad back. She testified that she only smoked marijuana \noccasionally, maybe once every year or two with her friends, with her most recent use in \nabout 2012. She later testified that her marijuana use varied from about once a month \nto about once every two to three months, with a period of abstinence of about eight to \nnine years. (Tr. at 25-28, 51-57; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \n \nApplicant was arrested in 1990 and charged with possession of a controlled \nsubstance. The controlled substances were marijuana and methamphetamine. She was \nconvicted of the charge and sentenced to 30 days in jail, which was suspended, and \nprobation for 24 months. (Tr. at 23-24, 34-38; GE 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for assault in 2000. She stated that she was drunk, got in \na fight with her ex-husband, and \u201cpoked\u201d him with a pair of scissors. The District \nAttorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute. (Tr. at 23, 38-40; GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2004 and charged with criminal mischief and disorderly \nconduct. She testified that she had been drinking, and she set her ex-husband\u2019s clothes \non fire on the lawn. She thought the charges were dismissed. However, the FBI \nidentification record indicates that she was convicted of the offenses. She was \nsentenced to six months in jail (suspended) and a $500 fine for the criminal mischief \noffense; and ten days in jail and a $100 fine ($50 suspended) for the disorderly conduct \noffense. (Tr. at 23, 40-41; GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2006 for injury to property. She stated that she \naccidently broke her sister\u2019s window. Her sister was angry at her for an unrelated matter \nand called the police. Applicant paid for the window, and charges were either never filed \nor dismissed. (Tr. at 22-23, 42-43; GE 3) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2011 and charged with driving under the influence \n(DUI). She pleaded guilty to impaired driving. She was sentenced to 180 days in jail, \nwith 178 days suspended; probation for 12 months; 48 hours of community service; and \na fine. Applicant does not believe she was too drunk to drive. She asserted that she \nonly had one beer. She admitted it was a large beer of about 32 ounces. She stated that \nher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .04%. (Tr. at 20-22, 43-47; GE 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 2015 and charged with disorderly conduct and \ntrespassing on private property. She paid a fine, and was ordered to complete \ncommunity service. The charges were then nolle prosequi (dismissed). She stated that \nshe and a friend were in a bar in a resort town. Her friend became extremely intoxicated \nand was yelling and screaming. The hotel they were staying at attempted to kick them \nout. They were subsequently arrested. (Tr. at 20, 47-49; GE 2, 3) \n \nAlcohol played a significant role in Applicant\u2019s criminal record. She stated that \nshe rarely drinks anymore, and then only in moderation. She has not been arrested or \ncharged with anything since the June 2015 arrest. Applicant moved to her current \nlocation in 2014 to live with her son who is in the military. He has been a positive \ninfluence on her, and she no longer associates with a bad crowd. He has noticed a \nchange in her and believes that she is honest, loyal, and not a threat to national \nsecurity. (Tr. at 28-29, 49, 58-62; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nApril 2016. She reported her 2011 DUI and her 2015 arrest for disturbing the peace \n(disorderly conduct). She denied any involvement with illegal drugs in the previous \nseven years. Applicant told the background investigator that it was unintentional, and \nshe must have misread the question. She testified that she did not list her marijuana \nuse because she \u201cwasn\u2019t a big-time marijuana smoker. It was an occasional thing, and \n[she] didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal.\u201d She also indicated that she is \u201cnot good with \nwords . . . . [She] didn\u2019t leave it out on purpose. [She] just didn\u2019t know how to word it.\u201d \n(Tr. at 25-27; GE 1) \n \nThe SOR alleges two defaulted student loans and a $370 delinquent medical \ndebt. Applicant rehabilitated the student loans, and they are in good standing. She was \njointly responsible for her ex-husband\u2019s medical debt. He was supposed to pay it. It is \nnot reflected on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. (Tr. at 33-34; GE 4-6) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n\n \n4 \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n5 \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nApplicant provided inconsistent explanations for why she did not report her \nmarijuana use on her SF 86. She was not a credible witness. I find that she intentionally \nprovided false information about her marijuana use on the SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is \napplicable.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant discussed her marijuana use with the background investigator in \nSeptember 2016 and again in May 2017. She then provided completely different \n\n \n6 \n \naccounts in her response to the SOR and during her testimony. I am unable to conclude \nthat Applicant now understands the importance of truthfulness in the security clearance \nprocess. There are no applicable mitigating conditions.  \n \nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nAll of the Guidelines H allegations are cross-alleged under Guidelines J. The two \nguidelines will be discussed together. The security concerns for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and criminal conduct are set out in AG \u00b6\u00b6 24 and 30:       \n \n24. The Concern. The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the \nmisuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n30. The Concern. Criminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and \nregulations. \n \n \nApplicant has multiple arrests and convictions, including a conviction for \npossession of a controlled substance. She used marijuana for many years. The \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under Guidelines H and J are established: \n \n25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n31(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26 and 32 describe conditions that could mitigate drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and criminal conduct security concerns. The following are potentially \napplicable: \n \n26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility;  \n \n32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n32(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant was either convicted or admitted culpability for all the arrests, with the \nexception of the 2006 arrest for injury to property (SOR \u00b6 1.c). I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.c for \nApplicant. \n \n \nThere is no evidence of marijuana use after 2014 or arrests after June 2015. I \nbelieve Applicant\u2019s son is a positive influence on her. Nonetheless, I still have significant \nconcerns, primarily related to her credibility. As discussed above, Applicant intentionally \nprovided false information throughout this process. I am unable to determine that \nadditional drug abuse or criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The \n\n \n8 \n \nabove mitigating factors, individually or collectively, are insufficient to dispel the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse and criminal conduct security concerns.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant rehabilitated the student loans, and they are in good standing. She \nwas jointly responsible for her ex-husband\u2019s medical debt. He was supposed to pay it. It \nis not reflected on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. Concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, F, H, and J in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations), but she did \nnot mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct), H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse), and J (criminal conduct).  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him by the Defense Department in 2006. He has worked as an engineer technician for a company in the defense industry since about 2005. His formal education includes some college in 2008. His employment history does not include military service. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2006. He married his current spouse in 2010. He has an adult child from a previous relationship, a minor child from his first marriage, and two minor stepchildren from his current marriage. The three minor children live with Applicant and his spouse. His spouse is employed outside the home as a human-resources manager for a private company. Applicant has a history of involvement with marijuana going back to the early 1990s, which he does not dispute. The SOR is concerned about three particular incidents in 1992, 1995, and 2017. Each is discussed below. Applicant was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, a marijuana pipe or bong, in March 1992. The arrest stemmed from a police investigation of a domestic disturbance at the home where Applicant was living at the time. The county attorney declined to prosecute the case due to possible problems with the search, resulting in insufficient evidence to ensure a reasonable likelihood of conviction.2 Applicant was arrested about three years later in June 1995 for the misdemeanor offenses of possession of marijuana and driving on ",

He did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate his \ninvolvement with marijuana. The most recent incident occurred in January 2017, when \nhe knowingly used marijuana at a New Year\u2019s Day party while holding a security \nclearance. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on June 15, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a \nsecurity clearance application. Thereafter, on July 28, 2017, after reviewing the \napplication and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guidelines known as Guideline H for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and Guideline E for personal conduct. The sole allegation under \nGuideline E is simply a cross-allegation of the matters alleged under Guideline H.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 16, 2017. He admitted the SOR \nallegations under Guideline H while not addressing the Guideline E allegation. He \nprovided brief explanations for his admissions. And he requested an in-person hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on December 13, 2017. The hearing was \nconducted as scheduled on April 19, 2018. Both Department Counsel and Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Government Exhibits 1-4 and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A-Q. The record closed on April 23, 2018, when Applicant \nsubmitted a post-hearing exhibit, which was admitted without objections as Exhibit R. \nThe hearing transcript was received on May 3, 2018.   \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \npreviously granted to him by the Defense Department in 2006. He has worked as an \nengineer technician for a company in the defense industry since about 2005. His formal \neducation includes some college in 2008. His employment history does not include \nmilitary service. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2006. He married his current \nspouse in 2010. He has an adult child from a previous relationship, a minor child from \nhis first marriage, and two minor stepchildren from his current marriage. The three minor \nchildren live with Applicant and his spouse. His spouse is employed outside the home \nas a human-resources manager for a private company.  \n  \nApplicant has a history of involvement with marijuana going back to the early \n1990s, which he does not dispute. The SOR is concerned about three particular \nincidents in 1992, 1995, and 2017. Each is discussed below. \n \nApplicant was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, a marijuana pipe or \nbong, in March 1992. The arrest stemmed from a police investigation of a domestic \ndisturbance at the home where Applicant was living at the time. The county attorney \ndeclined to prosecute the case due to possible problems with the search, resulting in \ninsufficient evidence to ensure a reasonable likelihood of conviction.2 \n \nApplicant was arrested about three years later in June 1995 for the misdemeanor \noffenses of possession of marijuana and driving on a suspended license.3 At the time, \n                                                          \n2 Exhibit A.  \n \n3 Exhibit B.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nhe was using marijuana once or twice a week.4 His arrest stemmed from a traffic stop \ndue to an expired registration. The vehicle was searched and a small amount of \nmarijuana in a container was discovered. He subsequently pleaded guilty and the court \nimposed a fine, which he was supposed to pay over time. He failed to make timely \npayment and ended up serving about 40 days in jail in lieu of the fine.5 \n \nThe third incident occurred on January 1, 2017, when he smoke marijuana (three \nto four puffs off a joint) while attending a New Year\u2019s Day party unaccompanied by his \nspouse.6 He tested positive for marijuana on a random drug screening test on January \n26, 2017. His employer was notified of the positive test on January 31, 2017, and he \nwas suspended without pay. He had not reported the marijuana use before the positive \ndrug test result. Subsequently, his employer decided that his continued employment \nwas contingent upon successful completion of an approved substance-abuse program \nand a negative drug test result. He completed the approved substance-abuse program \nwith no further services recommended on March 23, 2017. He had drug testing on \nMarch 27, 2017, which produced a negative test result, and he returned to work the \nfollowing day under a last-chance agreement with his employer.7 \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant attributed his January 2017 marijuana use to a lapse in \ngood judgment.8 He described the incident as \u201ca weak, stupid moment,\u201d \u201ca stupid move \non [his] part,\u201d and he deeply regrets it.9 He stated that he had not used marijuana since \nhis arrest in 1995.10 He has no intention of using marijuana or any other illegal drug in \nthe future. He submitted a signed statement of intent setting forth his intention to abstain \nfrom all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.11   \n \nIn addition to the signed statement of intent, Applicant submitted a number of \ndocuments in support of his case.12 The documents include highly favorable letters of \nrecommendation from two co-workers as well as a letter of reference from the senior \nminister of his church.13 He submitted proof of his attendance at multiple sessions of \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 45.  \n \n5 Tr. 44-45.  \n \n6 Exhibits 2, G, and I; Tr. 37-40.  \n \n7 Tr. 57-58.  \n \n8 Tr. 47-48.  \n \n9 Tr. 39-40.  \n \n10 Tr. 45.  \n \n11 Exhibit R.  \n \n12 Exhibits C \u2013 Q.  \n \n13 Exhibits C, D, and E.  \n\n \n4 \n \nNarcotics Anonymous (NA). And he submitted multiple documents as evidence of his \ngood employment record and job-related training.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.14 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.15 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d16 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.17 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.18 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.19 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.20 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.21 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.22 An \n14 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n15 Department of the Navy v.

In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance abuse; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; \n                                                          \n23 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n24 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n25 AG \u00b6 24.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana, which \nincludes two arrests, one conviction resulting in some jail time, and the recent January \n2017 marijuana use while holding a security clearance. Indeed, his January 2017 \nmarijuana use was about six months after he submitted his June 2016 security \nclearance application. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a \nperson\u2019s security worthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs while granted \naccess to classified information. Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana during the early \n1990s is easily mitigated as youthful indiscretions that are common among some people \nin their early 20s. The fact that he was granted a security clearance in 2006 bears this \npoint out. The same cannot be said for his marijuana use in January 2017 as a working \nengineer technician for a company in the defense industry. More is expected given his \nage and maturity in January 2017. And Applicant should have known better in light of \nhis decade of employment with a defense contractor while holding a security clearance \nand being subject to random drug tests.  \n \n \nApplicant presented a good case in reform and rehabilitation. It is apparent that \nhe now understands the seriousness of his January 2017 marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that he is an acceptable security \nrisk. I reached that conclusion for a couple of reasons. First, his January 2017 \nmarijuana use was clearly forbidden conduct that he chose to engage in despite \nknowing the potential negative consequences. In addition to being a serious lapse in \ngood judgment, his marijuana use demonstrated a willingness to engage in high-risk \nbehavior, which does not make him a good candidate for a security clearance. Second, \nI doubt Applicant\u2019s January 2017 marijuana use would have come to light but for the \nrandom drug test. He did not report his January 2017 marijuana use to his employer, \nbut instead hoped to avoid detection by having the substance pass through his system \nbefore the next random drug test. His reluctance to voluntarily self-report such adverse \ninformation further undermines his suitability for a security clearance.  \n    \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \n\n \n7 \n \nevidence or vice versa. In particular, I considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s employer \nelected to continue his employment after his January 2017 marijuana use. I also \nconsidered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant26  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

His drug use has been mitigated. Based on a review of the pleadings, testimony, \nand exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 28, 2016. (Government Exhibit 1.) On July 25, 2017, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and H (Drug Involvement). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on or after June 8, 2017.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 14, 2017, with \nattachments and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on December 22, 2017. The case was assigned to me \non January 4, 2018. Due to a family medical emergency the case was reassigned to \nanother administrative judge on January 25, 2018. The case was reassigned to me on \nMarch 20, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice \nof Hearing on March 20, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 3, 2018. The \nGovernment offered Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A, B, D, \nE, H, K, L, and M. There are no Applicant Exhibits C, F, G, I, or J. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere also admitted without objection. Applicant requested the record remain open for \nsubmission of additional exhibits. He submitted Applicant Exhibits N and O, which were \nalso admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May \n11, 2018.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old software engineer.

(Tr. 45, 66.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted all three allegations under this \nparagraph.  \n \n \n2.a and 2.b. Applicant purchased marijuana once, and used it several times during \na single month in 2013. At that time Applicant was in severe pain from his knee and back, \nand prescription painkillers were not working for him. He used marijuana between two \nand four times during that period. The marijuana did nothing for his pain, so he stopped \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nusing it. (Government Exhibits 1 at Section 23, and 2; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 24-25, 52-\n58.) \n \n \n2.c. Applicant began having seizures in 2015. He did research that indicated \ningesting marijuana or pills that contained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active \ningredient in marijuana, would possibly help stop the seizures. At that time he consumed \nseveral THC pills that were prescribed for someone else. The pills were unsuccessful in \nstopping his seizures, so he stopped using them. (Government Exhibits 1 at Section 23, \nand 2; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 25, 58-62.) \n \n \nApplicant had not used illegal drugs since 2015 and has no intention of using illegal \ndrugs in the future. As of the date of the hearing he was not taking any pain medication, \nor other medication. (Tr. 60-63.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations)  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant, based on the evidence, had 24 delinquent accounts that he could not or \nchose not to resolve. These debts have been in existence for a considerable period of \ntime. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case, with several exceptions. As stated, subparagraphs 1.a, b, c, and r are \nfound for Applicant. With regard to AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant has had a long history of medical \nailments that have obviously affected his finances in a detrimental way. However, there \nis little evidence that Applicant has acted responsibly to try and resolve his debts. He still \nowes a considerable amount of money, and has no plan about how to pay it off. Applicant \ndid not even pay the smallest debts, for $18 and $25. He failed to submit evidence that \nwould tend to support any of the other mitigating conditions. There is no basis for me to \nfind that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \n \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana for a brief time in 2013. He used THC \npills for a brief time in 2015. Both of the stated disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant has had severe pain issues, and a history of seizures. The drug use was \na misguided attempt by him to resolve those medical issues after other treatment had \nfailed. The use of marijuana and THC pills was unsuccessful, Applicant realized it and \nstopped the conduct, and credibly stated he would not use illegal drugs again in the future. \nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his past drug use. Paragraph 2 is \nfound for Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concern caused by his significant financial difficulties. Overall, the record \nevidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct, because he did not provide sufficient evidence that his alcohol-related \noffenses are unlikely to recur. Eligibility for continued access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 26, 2015. On \nJanuary 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant alleging security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, \nand Guideline J, criminal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n01/09/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 21, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was initially assigned to another administrative judge on April 18, 2018, and \nwas assigned to me on July 23, 2018. On July 27, 2018, a notice of hearing was issued, \nscheduling the case for August 22, 2018.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection. I left \nthe record open to provide him the opportunity to submit additional evidence.1 He timely \nsubmitted 11 additional exhibits, which were marked and admitted without objection as \nAE 1 through 11 (as Applicant had listed them).2 DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on August 30, 2018. The record closed on September 12, 2018.  \n \nAmendments to the SOR \n \n \nAt the start of the hearing, I amended the SOR to correct two grammatical errors, \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.b. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b were also amended during the hearing to \nconform to the record evidence, reflecting the dates of Applicant\u2019s arrests, instead of the \ncourt dates.

(Tr. 123-124, 129-131) Department Counsel provided a copy of the page after the hearing, and it \nis included in GE 2.  \n \n2 AE A is a recommendation letter. AE 1 is a September 2015 letter regarding Applicant\u2019s completion of \nthe conditions of community supervision after his 2014 offense. AE 2 is a work award. AE 3 and AE 4 are \nmedical records from Applicant\u2019s August 30, 2018 session with his doctor. AE 5 is a December 6, 2016 \nletter from Applicant\u2019s counsel in a legal matter with his wife.

Since 1998, he has worked as a defense \ncontractor, either for his current employer or its predecessor. He works as a systems \nengineer and program manager. He has held a security clearance since his time in the \nNavy, and needs a clearance for his job. (Tr. 31, 35-37; GE 1; AE 6-AE 11) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife married in 1994. They have two daughters, ages 20 and \n21. Both are now in college. He also has a 28-year-old stepson, his wife\u2019s son from a \nprior relationship. Applicant and his wife have had several separations. They first \nseparated in 2005. They reconciled in 2007, but his wife then spent the next four years \nin jail after her fourth conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) or driving while \nintoxicated (DWI). (Tr. 34, 67) She returned to the home in 2011 after her release. She \nmoved out of the house again in November 2014, and was away for about the next \nyear. Applicant and his wife separated again in about June 2016. He later retained legal \ncounsel and considered divorce. (AE 5; Tr. 92) They remained separated at the time of \nApplicant\u2019s background interview, in February 2017. (GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife returned to the home in December 2017, though she moved out \nagain in January 2018. It is unclear when she returned, but at the time of the hearing, \nthey remained legally married and were living under the same roof, though maintaining \nseparate lives. Applicant said they do not speak, and do not have arguments. \u201cI don\u2019t \nknow what there would be to fight about,\u201d he said. Applicant is the household\u2019s sole \nfinancial provider, and he pays the mortgage. (Tr. 31-39, 89-93; GE 1) \n \n \nIn August 2012, Applicant had an altercation with his stepson, then age 22, over \nhis compliance with house rules. Applicant had consumed several beers over several \nhours while watching an early-season college football game at home. During the \naltercation, his wife called the police, and Applicant was arrested and charged with \nassault and battery of his stepson. (Tr. 40-46, 83-84; GE 1; GE 3) In about October \n2012, Applicant went to court and pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to one year of \nprobation, and ordered to attend anger-management classes. He completed the terms \nof his sentence. (Tr. 47-48, 83; GE 1 at 26-27; GE 3 at 3; Answer) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \n \n \nIn December 2013, Applicant had an altercation with his wife. Both of them had \nbeen drinking. Applicant testified that his wife had a habit of stealing his wallet and keys, \nand he believed she had done so on this occasion. He grabbed her wrists and pulled \nher up off the couch in an effort to get her to help him look for his wallet. They lost their \nbalance and fell over, and his wife hit her head, though she was not injured. Applicant \nhad consumed between two and four beers, and said he was \u201cbuzzed\u201d but not \nintoxicated. No one was arrested at the time. (Tr. 48-53, 86-87; GE 3 at 4) \n \n \nA few months later, in February 2014, Applicant\u2019s wife and their elder daughter, \nthen 17, had an altercation, in which his daughter threw a coffee mug at her mother, \nhitting her in the face. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law was visiting at the time, and he called \npolice. The daughter was arrested and spent the night in juvenile detention. (GE 3 at 4; \nTr. 67-70, 85-86) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife then told the police about the December 2013 altercation with \nher husband. Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic assault upon his wife. \nHe spent the night in jail. (Tr. 53, 84-87; GE 1 at 27-29; GE 3 at 4) (SOR \u00b6 2.b) In June \n2014, Applicant pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years of probation and \nordered to attend 12 weeks of alcohol education and domestic-violence training. (Tr. 49-\n53, 87; GE 1 at 27-29; GE 3 at 4)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two daughters were referred to therapy through his employer\u2019s \nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP). Through Applicant\u2019s own involvement, he was \nreferred to mental-health and substance-abuse counseling.3 (Tr. 57-59, 99-100; GE 2 at \n5) \n \n \nAt his initial evaluation in May 2014, Applicant reported that he began drinking at \nage 16. His drinking had increased gradually over the previous seven years (beginning \nin 2007, the year his first separation ended, and the year his wife went to jail). During \nthat time, his longest period of abstinence was four days. (GE 2 at 42) Applicant self-\nreported that he drank about five nights a week, usually by himself. He would have two \nor three shots of liquor on weekdays (including the night before the evaluation), and four \nto six shots on weekend nights. He reported some history of \u201cshakes, queasy stomach, \nnight sweats, and anxiety the next day after drinking heavily,\u201d as well as likely partial \nblackouts. He recognized \u201cthat drinking has become a problem with his becoming \ndependent on it.\u201d He expressed a desire to cut back on his drinking though he had not \nbeen able to do so. (GE 2 at 41)  \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and depressive disorder not \notherwise specified (NOS) by a Ph.D. licensed clinical psychologist. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The \npsychologist recommended that Applicant participate in an intensive outpatient \nchemical-dependency program. (GE 2 at 39, 42) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s treatment plan included drug and alcohol abstinence, participation in \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA), and development of an effective social-support network \nand of coping strategies for dealing with stress. Documentation reflects that Applicant \nwas briefed verbally on the treatment program: (\u201cI have gone over this plan with \n[Applicant]\u201d and he \u201cverbally agrees to treatment plan.\u201d) (GE 2 at 43) \n \n \nApplicant began the intensive outpatient group treatment program on June 16, \n2014. (GE 2 at 35) He missed a week of group sessions in late July 2014 after he \nrelapsed into binge drinking. (GE 2 at 23-38) When he returned to the program, he \ncontinued attendance and completed the required 18 sessions on August 11, 2014. (AE \n1) He attended AA during the program. (GE 2 at 7, 14) His prognosis in mid-August \n2014 was \u201cpoor to guarded.\u201d (GE 2 at 16, 17) There is no record evidence of a \nsubsequent prognosis. \n \n                                                          \n3 GE 2 is a 43-page exhibit consisting of treatment records from both the psychology provider and the \nintensive outpatient substance abuse counseling provider.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant returned for individual therapy with EAP in late September 2014. He \nreported that during the intensive outpatient group treatment, his longest period of \nsobriety was about three weeks. He resumed drinking shortly after completing that \nprogram. In late August 2014, Applicant\u2019s son-in-law moved back into the home. \nApplicant and his wife coped with the resulting stress by drinking, despite what he \nindicated was a court order not to do so. It was recommended that he develop a more \nextensive recovery plan with AA and that he identify how to achieve longer-term \nsobriety. (Tr. 68-75; GE 2 at 14)  \n \n \nAt the time, Applicant\u2019s daughters had been removed from the home by Child \nProtective Services (CPS), in August 2014, and an October 2014 court date was \npending. As part of his efforts to get them released by CPS and back into his custody, \nApplicant requested and received a prescription for Campral to help with his alcohol \ncravings, because, he said, he wanted to do more than what was required. (Tr. 66, 76-\n77; GE 2 at 13)  \n \n \nApplicant continued therapy with the EAP psychologist through late 2014. He \nwas sober for several months. He reported to his providers that the Campral was \nworking and that he found AA useful. (GE 2 at 7) In order for Applicant\u2019s daughters to \nreturn home from CPS custody, his wife had to leave the home, which she did, in \nNovember 2014. She was out of the home for the next year. (Tr. 68-75) Applicant\u2019s last \ndocumented therapy session with EAP was in November 2014. (GE 2 at 1)  \n \n \nApplicant completed a parenting class in December 2014. He completed a \nbatterer\u2019s intervention program between March and July 2015. He tested negative for \nalcohol on August 27, 2015. A September 9, 2015 letter from community supervision \nauthorities documented that he completed the requirements of his probation. (AE 1) He \nsaid he had been given drug and alcohol tests during his probation. (Tr. 54-63) \nApplicant completed his two-year probation period in June 2016. He has had no \nsubsequent arrests or criminal offenses. (Tr. 88)  \n \n \nApplicant had a background interview in February 2017 in connection with his \nSCA. He reported consuming alcohol three or four times a week. He reported \nconsuming two beers when in public, and up to eight beers at home. As to hard liquor, \nhe reported consuming one to two cocktails in public, and three shots and four cocktails \n\u201cif he is trying to get loose and have fun.\u201d He said he drank three shots and four \ncocktails, or eight beers, about twice a month \u201cto get buzzed.\u201d He said this had been his \ndrinking pattern intake for the previous 10 years. He drank more when he was younger. \n(GE 3 at 5) This alcohol consumption is alleged as a security concern, as it post-dates \nhis diagnosis of alcohol dependence, in 2014. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his offenses, accepted \nresponsibility for his conduct, and expressed regret. He said he had been in a \u201ctoxic \nrelationship.\u201d He said he had completed the required treatment plan and all probationary \nrequirements for both of his offenses. He disputed that he had been diagnosed with \nalcohol dependence. (Answer) \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he drinks three or four times a week. \nSometimes he drinks cocktails or two or three shots of alcohol, and sometimes he \ndrinks \u201cno more than two\u201d bottles of beer when out with others. He denied that he drinks \nto excess. (Tr. 108-109)  \n \n  \n \nApplicant testified that prior to this hearing, he had not seen documentation that \nhe had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent, and that his diagnosis had never been \ndiscussed with him during his treatment. (Tr. 62-64, 88, 101). As he did in his Answer, \nApplicant repeatedly testified that he had never been diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence, and that he disagreed with the diagnosis. Applicant said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree \nwith the statement that I\u2019m alcohol dependent;\u201d (Tr. 76) and \u201cI don\u2019t consider [myself] - I \nmean, alcohol dependent, I just don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d (Tr. 79; 80, 113)  \n \n \nTreatment records reflect that Applicant\u2019s EAP psychologist diagnosed him with \nalcohol dependence in May 2014 and that Applicant was verbally briefed on his \ntreatment plan and agreed to it. (GE 2 at 43) His treatment records do not indicate that \nApplicant was expressly told he was alcohol dependent.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that no medical doctor or licensed clinical social worker \n(LCSW) ever told him he was an alcoholic or that he had a drinking problem. (Tr. 102, \n111) He acknowledged that he would have been told or advised to stop drinking as part \nof the intensive outpatient program: \u201cI may have been. I mean, that\u2019s their goal. . . . I \nwould say as part of the program, yeah.\u201d (Tr. 65; 76, 103)  \n \n  \nApplicant has not seen any other treatment provider for substance abuse other \nthat what is reflected in GE 2. (Tr. 77, 110) He does not currently see a therapist or \nalcohol counselor. He does not believe he has a drinking problem. (Tr. 77-78, 80) He \noffered no evidence that he is currently participating in AA or any similar counseling \ngroup, nor did he indicate involvement with a support network to help him curtail his \ndrinking. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he and his wife have a history of confrontations, all \nof which involve alcohol: \u201c[Applicant] reports infrequent physical fights with his wife, with \nthe drinking having always been involved when they have occurred.\u201d (GE 2 at 2; Tr. 81) \nHe recognizes that his wife has a problem with alcohol, given her history of DUIs and \nDWIs. (Tr. 81-82) Applicant expressed regret for his actions, and accepted responsibility \nfor them. (Answer; Tr. 65, 113-114) \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation at the hearing to refute or to update the \n2014 diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (Tr. 81) After the hearing, he provided \ndocumentation from his primary care physician, whom he visited on August 30, 2018. \nHis provider noted that Applicant \u201chad ETOH [alcohol] issues a few years ago\u201d and that \nhe was \u201cnow fighting to have his legal/employment status returned to normal.\u201d Among \nthe \u201cdiagnoses attached to this encounter\u201d was a diagnosis of Alcoholism. Applicant\u2019s \nprovider \u201cadvised counseling to resolve legal/alcohol issues.\u201d (AE 3, AE 4) The \ndocumentation does not include an updated diagnosis of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use \ndisorder, nor does it note any prognosis for the future.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant oversees a contract supporting communication networks for Navy \nships. He has had no reportable security incidents. References attest that he carries \nhimself with dignity and takes great pride in his work. He is regarded as highly valued by \nhis government customers, and has the trust and confidence of those who rely on him. \nHis references recommend retention of his clearance. (AE A; AE 2; AE 6 \u2013 AE 11)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.4 As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d5 \n \n \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n4 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to \na security clearance\u201d).  \n \n5 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) or alcohol use disorder;  \n \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n \n(f) alcohol consumption which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence in May 2014 by a Ph.D. clinical psychologist. By his own admission, \nApplicant also requested and received a prescription for Campral to ease his alcohol \ncravings in October 2014, evidence which supports such a diagnosis. AG \u00b6 22(d) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant also engaged in habitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies.  \n \n \nThe record evidence does not establish that Applicant was told he was alcohol \ndependent. However, treatment records reflect that Applicant\u2019s EAP psychologist \ndiagnosed Applicant with alcohol dependence in May 2014, and that Applicant was \nverbally briefed on his treatment plan and agreed to it. Applicant\u2019s treatment plan \nincluded abstinence from alcohol and participation in AA. Applicant participated in AA \nduring 2014, but had difficulty abstaining from alcohol.  \n \n \nThe longest Applicant was able to abstain during intensive treatment was about \nthree weeks. He engaged in binge drinking in July 2014, and missed a week of \ntreatment. He resumed drinking shortly after completing his mandatory 18 sessions of \ntreatment, in August 2014, when his stepson returned home. He resumed drinking after \nhe completed probation in June 2016. He was consuming alcohol several times a week \nat the time of his background interview (February 2017) and also at the time of the \nhearing (August 2018). I conclude that Applicant\u2019s subsequent consumption of alcohol, \n\n \n9 \n \nafter he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, satisfies AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n22(e) and 22(f).  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \n \n \nThe documentation Applicant provided from his primary care physician is \ninsufficient to rebut or mitigate the diagnosis of alcohol dependence. AE 4 in fact \nreferences a prior diagnosis of alcoholism. The statement that Applicant \u201chad ETOH \nissues a few years ago,\u201d without further detail, is insufficient evidence to establish that \nApplicant\u2019s issues with alcohol are fully resolved. Indeed, Applicant\u2019s doctor \u201cadvised \ncounseling to resolve legal/alcohol issues,\u201d (emphasis added) leading to the conclusion \nthat Applicant\u2019s alcohol issues are ongoing and are not resolved or fully in the past. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant is not in alcohol treatment currently (and he relapsed during treatment \nin 2014). AG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. Despite the relapse, Applicant did complete the \nintensive outpatient group treatment in summer 2014. However, he has not \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not apply. Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol involvement security concerns.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \n \n\n \n10 \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s two domestic violence offenses satisfy the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 31:  \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable, under AG \u00b6 32:   \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two domestic violence offenses occurred in August 2012 and \nDecember 2013, respectively. He completed probation successfully and there is no \nevidence of subsequent offenses. These offenses are not recent. Applicant also has an \nexcellent employment record.  \n \n \nHowever, AG \u00b6 32(d) only partially applies, because Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. This is chiefly because Applicant did not \nestablish that his offenses are unlikely to recur. Applicant and his wife maintain separate \nlives, but they remain married and living under the same roof. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he and his wife have a history of confrontations, and they are always alcohol-\nrelated. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, while dated, is clearly intertwined with his alcohol \ninvolvement. And his alcohol issues are unresolved and remain a security risk. Given \nthis evidence, I cannot conclude Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is unlikely to recur and no \nlonger casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) does \nnot apply. Applicant did not meet his burden to establish that the criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated.  \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. I must also consider the total \npattern of Applicant\u2019s behavior, not just in a piecemeal fashion as a series of unrelated \nincidents.6 In this regard, I can and do consider the fact that Applicant\u2019s offenses are \nalcohol-related, even though they were not alleged under Guideline G.7 \n \nApplicant is still drinking frequently, despite a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. \nThe documentation he submitted post-hearing from his doctor is not sufficient evidence \nto establish that his diagnosis no longer applies. I credit Applicant with accepting \nresponsibility for his offenses. He is credited with taking steps to return his daughters to \nhome, and he remains in a difficult family situation. However, he has not established a \nsupport network for dealing with his alcohol issues. He is not in AA or a similar \ncounseling program. He still consumes alcohol several times a week, despite a \ntreatment recommendation that he should abstain. Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate security concerns under either guideline alleged. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued \neligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n6 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-22563 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (regarding the need to avoid a \npiecemeal analysis). \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s offenses were not alleged as being alcohol-related under Guideline G. However, I can \nconsider that evidence under the whole-person concept. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006). \n\n \n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n________________________ \nBraden M.

Eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\nHistory of Case\nOn March 2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication\nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOD\nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a security  clearance should be granted, continued, denied,\nor revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security\nExecutive Agent, Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), dated\nDecember 10, 2016, effective June 8, 2017.\n04/16/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 14, 2018, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on February 19, 2019, and was scheduled for hearing on April\nFebruary 14, 2019. At the scheduled hearing, the Government's case consisted of six\nexhibits (GEs 1-6) that were admitted without objection; Applicant relied on one witness\n(himself) and six exhibit (AEs A-F) that were admitted without objection. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on February 26, 2018.   \nBesides its six exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of certain\nfacts pertaining to Afghanistan. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of\nnotice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd.\nApril 12, 2007). Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government\nreports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co.\n2006).  \nThere being no objection, and for good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the requested facts and incorporated source documents\naddressing the geopolitical situation in Afghanistan. The Government\u2019s administrative\nnotice and incorporated source documents were received as HE 1. Administrative notice\nwas extended to the requested facts and incorporated source documents consistent with\nthe provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. This notice did not foreclose Applicant from\nchallenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing the current status of Afghanistan. \nIn addition to taking official notice of the facts and source documents covered by\nthe Administrative Notice Request, I took official notice, sua sponte, of Background Note:\nAfghanistan, U.S. Department of State (November 2011) This document contains\npertinent background information covering Afghanistan. This document was received as\nHE 2.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with endorsements and payment\ndocumentation of several of his SOR-listed delinquent debts. For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted 30 days to supplement the record, and the Government was\nafforded three days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant provided emailed\nendorsements, payment documentation, and updates of his creditor contacts. Applicant\u2019s\nsubmissions were admitted without objection as AEs G-M.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 13 delinquent debts\nexceeding $11,500. Allegedly, these debts remain outstanding and unresolved. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly was terminated from two prior places of\nemployment as the result of claimed violations of (a) company policies covering\ncomplaints of unwanted sexual advances and (b) of company policies related to\nsocializing with a visitor. \n2\n\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly has family members (parents, brothers,\nand a mother-in-law) who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations with\nexplanations. He denied being terminated from prior employment positions. He claimed\nhe was set up in connection with his alleged termination from Company A, and he denied\never socializing with a visitor in connection with his alleged termination from Company B. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year old administrative assistant for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant was born and raised in Afghanistan to parents of Afghan descent. (GEs\n1-3; Tr. 43) He  immigrated to the United States in February 2008 with his wife and two\nchildren looking for a better life. (GE 1-3) He received a green card in 2008 and was\nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen in September 2016.

(GEs 2-3 and Appellant\u2019s response; Tr. 45) Two of his children were born in\nAfghanistan, and all of them attend U.S. schools. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 45) Applicant\u2019s wife\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2003. (GE 1) \nApplicant reported no advanced educational credits in the United States or military\nservice. (GEs 1-6) He has never held a U.S. security clearance. (GEs 1-3) \nSince December 2016, A (GEs 1-2) Applicant has worked as an administrative\nassistant for a defense contractor. He reported brief periods of unemployment in 2016\nfollowing his terminations by Company A in July 2015 and more recently by Company B\nin March 2016. (GEs 1-2) Between 2008 and July 2015, he worked for different non-\ndefense employers in various jobs (some full-time and some part-time) and reported\ninterspersed periods of unemployment. (GEs 1-2)\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Applicant worked as a linguist for the U.S. Army and\ndiplomatic services in Afghanistan. (GEs 1-3 and AEs E and K; Tr. 38-39, 46-47) He is\nfluent in both Hindi and Urdu and is interested in pursuing translation opportunities with\nthe U.S. Army in the future. (Tr. 39, 42-45) Since immigrating to the United States,\nApplicant has never returned to Afghanistan and has never been visited by any of his\nfamily members residing in Afghanistan. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 53)\n3\n\nApplicant\u2019s family members\nApplicant has numerous family members who are citizens and residents of\nAfghanistan. His parents, three elder brothers and his mother-in-law all are citizens and\nresidents of Afghanistan. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 46) His mother is an educated kindergarten\nteacher for a public school and is compensated by the Afghan government for her\nservices. (Tr. 48-49) His father is a retired military officer who served two years of active\nduty (1979-1981) in the Afghan military forces before being separated in 1981 for\nmedical reasons with the rank of colonel. (GE 2; Tr. 37-38, 41-43, 48-50) Since his\nmedical separation, Applicant\u2019s father has been unemployed and has no affiliation with\nthe Afghan government or any foreign government. (GE 2) None of Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers (inclusive of his parents, brothers, and mother-in-law) residing in Afghanistan\nhave any known affiliations with the Afghan government or military. (GE 2; Tr. 40)\nApplicant maintains monthly telephone contact with his parents and in the past\nhas sent money to them on numerous occasions between May 2008 and June 2011.\n(GE 2) He maintains less frequent contact with his brothers and mother-in-law in\nAfghanistan. He also maintains infrequent contact with uncles, cousins, and other\nextended family members who reside in Afghanistan. (GE 2)\nApplicant continues to provide financial support to his parents and sends them\nmoney every three months. (Tr. 51)  Within the past year, he estimated to have sent his\nparents between $7,000 and $8,000 to help them with their bills. (Tr. 51-53) Between\n2008 and 2011, he estimated to have remitted to his parents sums ranging between\n$150 and $2,000, and exceeding $8,000 in the aggregate. (GE 3)\nCountry information on Afghanistan\nAfghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia. It is sometimes referred to as the\ncrossroads of Central Asia.  See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 2.  It has had\na turbulent history. \n Following invasions by Alexander, the Scythians, the White Huns, and the Turks,\nthe Arabs invaded Afghanistan in 642 AD and introduced Islam. See Background Note:\nAfghanistan, supra, at 3.  Arab rule held for several hundred years before giving way to\nthe Persians who controlled the region until 998 before succumbing to the Turkic\nGhasnavids. (Id.) Turkish rule under Mahmud was short-lived and was followed by\nattempts by various princes to rule sections of the country before the Mongol invasion of\n1219 under Genghis Khan. (Id.) \nFor many centuries following Khan\u2019s death in 1227, the country was contested by\na succession of chiefs and princes. By the late 14  century, Tamerlane (a Khan\nth\ndescendent) incorporated Afghanistan into a vast Asian empire.  (Id.)\nIn 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani (the founder of what is known today as\nAfghanistan) established his control over most of Afghanistan. British expansion in the\n19  century was countered by Russian advances and precipitated Anglo-Afghan wars\nth\n4\n\nand later led to a boundary accord that created what would become modern Afghanistan. \nSee Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 3.\nSince the British relinquished control in August 1919, Afghanistan has been an\nindependent state. Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 3-4.  Between 1919 and\n1973, Afghanistan moved away from its longstanding isolation under a succession of\nMuslim rulers: King Amanullah (1919-1929), Nadir Khan (1929-1933), and Mohammad\nZahir Shah (Nadir Khan\u2019s 19-year-old son), who ruled Afghanistan for over 40 years\n(1933-1973).  See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra. \nPrime minister between 1953 and 1963, Sardar Mohammad Daoud mounted a\nmilitary coup in 1973 and seized power amid charges of corruption and malfeasance\nagainst Zahir Shah and his royal family. Daoud proceeded to abolish the monarchy,\nabrogate the constitution, and declare Afghanistan a republic. See Background Note:\nAfghanistan, supra, at, 4-5.  His economic and social reforms contributed little, however,\nto stabilizing political conditions in the country. Following a Soviet-supported overthrow\nand assassination of Daoud in April 1978, a Marxist government was formed with the\nbacking of the Soviets.  See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 5. Sur Muhammad\nTaraki was installed as the country\u2019s president of the revolutionary council.  \nOpposition to the Taraki government increased as many of members of Afghan\nelites, religious establishments, and intelligentsia were imprisoned, tortured, or\nmurdered.  A revolt against the Marxist government occurred in the summer of 1978 and\nquickly spread into a countrywide insurgency. (Id.)\nSoviet invasion\nSeeking to take advantage of the unrest following the April 1978 coup, the Soviet\nUnion quickly signed a bilateral treaty of friendship and cooperation with the new Afghan\nregime and increased its military assistance to the regime. See Background Note:\nAfghanistan, supra, at 5-6. Faced with a deteriorating security situation, the Soviets\ninvaded Afghanistan in December 1979, killed the Afghan ruler, and installed Babrak\nKarmal (an exiled leader of the Parcham faction) as the country\u2019s prime minister. (Id.) \nAfghan freedom fighters (mujahideen) who opposed the Karmal communist\nregime, armed with weapons and training assistance from the U.S. and its allies,\ncollaborated with other Peshawar-based guerilla groups in the 1980s to destabilize the\nKarmal regime. See  Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 6-7. The resistance\nmovement eventually led to an agreement known as the Geneva Accords (signed by the\nfront-line states of Pakistan and Afghanistan, the United States, and the Soviet Union).\nThe agreement served to ensure that Soviet forces withdrew from the country in\naccordance with their expressed commitments in February 1989. (Id.) \nAscendency of the Taliban  \nBy the mid-1990s, the Taliban had risen to power in reaction to the anarchy and\nincrease of warlords in the aftermath of the withdrawal of Soviet forces.  Many of the\nTaliban had been educated in madrassas in Pakistan with roots in rural Pashtun areas of\n5\n\nthe country.  See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 7  Beginning with its capture\nof Kandahar in 1994, the Taliban mounted an aggressive expansion of its control\nthroughout Afghanistan. By the end of 1998, its forces occupied almost 90 percent of the\ncountry, and reduced its opposition largely to a small sections of the northeast and the\nPanjshir valley. (Id.)   \nBolstered by its imposition of an extreme interpretation of Islam on the entire\ncountry, the Taliban committed massive human rights violations (particularly directed at\nwomen and children), and committed serious atrocities against minority populations. \nFrom the mid-1990s, the Taliban provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, and provided\na base of operations for his and other terrorist organizations. (Background Note:\nAfghanistan, supra, at 7-8). Bin Laden and his Al-Qaida group are known to have\nprovided financial and political support to the Taliban, and Al-Qaida acknowledged their\nresponsibility for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States.    \nBeginning in October 2001 (following the Taliban\u2019s refusal to expel bin Laden), the\nUnited States and its coalition partners initiated a military campaign, targeting terrorist\nfacilities and Taliban military and political assets within Afghanistan. U.S. military and\nanti-Taliban forces routed the Taliban and caused their rapid disintegration. After the fall\nof Kabul in November 2001, a UN-sponsored conference was created to restore stability\nand governance in Afghanistan. See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 7-8. From\nthis conference emerged a Transitional Authority headed by President Hamid Karzai.\nThis authority (renamed the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan) was charged with\nthe responsibility of drafting a constitution. (Id, at 8)\nA new constitution was drafted and ratified by a constitutional loyal jirga on\nJanuary 4, 2004. See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 8. The Afghan\nconstitution provides for indirect election of the National Assembly\u2019s upper house by the\nprovincial councils and by reserved presidential appointments. On December 4, 2004,\nthe country was renamed the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.  (Id; Country Specific\nInformation: Afghanistan, supra, at 1). Hamid Karzai was sworn in as Afghanistan\u2019s\nPresident on December 7, 2004. He presided over the new government\u2019s first convened\nparliament in late 2005. See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra. \nPresidential and provincial elections in Afghanistan for 2010 were  coordinated by\nthe Afghanistan Independent Election Commission (IEC), with assistance from the UN. \nId. Challenged presidential election results in 2010 have not been widely disseminated. \nSee Background Note: Afghanistan, supra, at 8-9. \n \nPolitical conditions in Afghanistan\nA new democratic government assumed control of Afghanistan in 2004 following a\npopular election.  While the national government has continued to expand its authority, it\nhas been hampered in its ability to deliver necessary social services and remains\ndependent on U.S.-led assistance. See Background Note: Afghanistan, supra. With its\ninternational community support at work, its ability to secure its borders and maintain\ninternal order is increasing. \n6\n\nAlthough the Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan has lost ground in some\nareas, it remains resilient and capable of challenging U.S. and NATO goals. Today,\nAfghanistan\u2019s local government lags, and corruption remains widespread. See\nAdministrative Notice, supra, at 3; Country Reports on Terrorism 2016, Ch. 5, Terrorist\nSafe Havens at 5, U.S. Department of State (July 2017)\nAfghan insurgency and extremist networks, fueled by Taliban, Al Qaida, and\nHaqqani Network support, continue to assert power and intimidation within the country. \nSee Administrative Notice, supra at 4; Country Reports on Terrorism 2016, Chapter 2 at\n1 U.S. Department of State (July 2017) Safety and security remain key concerns\nbecause these terrorist organizations continue to target U.S. and Afghan interests by\nsuicide operations, bombings, assassinations, car-jackings, assaults, and hostage-\ntaking. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 5; Report on Enhancing Security and\nStability in Afghanistan at 1, U.S. Department of Defense (June 2017).  Risks of terrorist\nactivity remain extremely high at the present time. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 3-\n4.\nHuman rights conditions in Afghanistan remain poor by all reported accounts. \nState Department Reports confirm active insurgent activity in Afghanistan. See Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices for 2016, Afghanistan, U.S. Department of State\n(March 2017). The Department of State\u2019s 2016 Human Rights Report also noted\nwidespread violence, predominantly indiscriminate attacks on civilians, armed insurgents\ngroups\u2019 killing of persons affiliated with the Afghan government, and targeted violence\nagainst women and girls. See Administrative Notice Request, supra, at 5-6; Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices for 2016: Afghanistan, supra.\nNo section of Afghanistan is safe or immune from risks of violence, kidnaping,\nhostage taking, military combat, operations, land-mines, banditry, armed rivalry between\npolitical and tribal groups, militant attacks, direct and indirect fire, suicide bombings, and\ninsurgent attacks. See Wave of Attacks Represent a Successful Urban Terrorism\nCampaign, U.S. Department of State at 1-2 (February 2018). Kabul, in particular, has\nexperienced increased militant attacks in recent years, including rocket attacks, vehicle-\nborne improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and suicide bombings. Id. Foreigners\nthroughout the country continue to be targeted for violent attacks and kidnappings: some\nmotivated by terrorism, and others by common criminal activity. \nTo date, Afghanistan has still encountered difficulties in building effective, honest,\nand loyal provincial and district institutions and lacks a coherent tribal engagement\nstrategy for unifying the country. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 3-4; Report on\nEnhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan, supra, at 1-2. Economic growth has\nbeen similarly slowed by a lack of investor confidence in the Afghan government and its\nprospects for the future.\nU.S.-Afghanistan relations\nLooking to the future, the United States recognizes the many challenges that the\nunity government of Afghanistan will continue to contend with as their leaders settle their\nown respective responsibilities. See Report on Enhancing Security and Stability in\n7\n\nAfghanistan, supra at 3. Despite these challenges, the fundamental partnership between\nthe U.S.-led coalition and the Afghan government remains strong. (Id.) Afghanistan\nremains an important partner of the United States in its war against terrorism., and the\nUnited States continues to deploy resources to assist Afghanistan improve its security,\ngovernance, institutions, and economy. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 6.\nSince the fall of the Taliban, the United States has supported the creation of a\nbroad-based government in Afghanistan, and has made a long-term commitment to help\nAfghanistan reconstitute and rebuild following years of war and unstable governments. \nThe United States and its coalition partners in the international community currently\nprovide important humanitarian assistance, capacity-building, security protection,\ncounter-narcotic programs, and infrastructure projects. The United States has also\nbrought important political influence to bear on the establishment of durable democratic\nprinciples that recognize and incorporate democratic principles, promote the rule of law\nand encourage transparent and accountable forms of government. See Report on\nEnhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan, supra.\nIn May 2012, the United States and Afghanistan signed the Enduring Strategic\nPartnership Agreement, demonstrated the United States\u2019 shared commitment to the\ncombating of terrorism and the promoting of democratic values and economic\nopportunity in Afghanistan and the region. See U.S. Relations with Afghanistan Fact\nSheet at 1-2, U.S. Department of State (January 2017). Through new initiatives forged\nbetween Afghanistan and the United States, beginning with the Silk Road Initiative\ncompleted in 2011, as a means of reconstructing infrastructure links in the region, both\ncountries have helped to bolster peace and stability in the region by supporting a\ntransition to trade and the opening of new markets in Central Asia and beyond. See  U.S.\nRelations with Afghanistan Fact Sheet at 1-2.\n  What strategic options the United States ultimately adopts to enhance its\nworking relations with Afghan\u2019s unity government in their joint efforts to limit the\nadvances of an increasingly aggressive Taliban are uncertain at this time. Efforts\nbetween the two countries continue to be exerted to promote economic growth, bolster\nAfghanistan\u2019s business climate, improve the performance of the country\u2019s justice system,\nand help the Afghan government to maintain, and improve upon, the gains the country\nhas made over the last decade in the areas of health, education, and women\u2019s rights.\nSee  U.S. Relations with Afghanistan Fact Sheet, supra, at 2.\nPrior employer terminations\nBetween July 2015 and March 2016, Applicant was twice terminated by\nrespective employers for violations of company policy. In July 2015, he was terminated\nby Company A due to cited policy violations relative to complaints of unwanted sexual\nadvances. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 56-57) At the time of his termination from Company A, he was a\nfull-time deputy jailer with a local detention center in his city of residence. Applicant\nexpressed surprise at the time of his termination and insisted he had done nothing wrong\nto warrant the termination. (GE 2; Tr. 56)\n8\n\nIn March 2016, Applicant was employed by another detention center and was\nterminated for cited reasons of violating company policy in socializing with a company\nvisitor. (GEs 2-3) Applicant insisted he did nothing wrong to warrant his termination by\nthis company. (GE 2; Tr. 57)\nAsked about his terminations in his scheduled interview with an investigator from\nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant acknowledged the terminations,\nwhile expressing surprise. (GE 2) His supervisor employed by the Company A detention\ncenter credited Applicant with honor, integrity, and superb job performance and\nattributed his termination to falling prey \u201cto people in power that wanted him not to work\nthere.\u201d (AE G) The current elected jailer with the Company B detention center could not\nprovide any further explanations of his termination. (AE G) \nBased on the competing versions offered of the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s termination from Company A, inferences are warranted that\nApplicant\u2019s account provides the most detailed and convincing version. Allegations of\npoor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness associated with Applicant\u2019s 2015\ntermination are unsubstantiated. \nAddressing his 2016 termination from Company B at the hearing, Applicant\nattributed his termination to disagreements with the cited deputy who was involved in a\nsexual encounter with a female employee. (Tr. 29-31) Applicant insisted that he had\nnever made any sexual advances on the employee and was falsely accused of doing so\nto divert attention from the guilty deputy. Applicant\u2019s accounts of this cited incident\nappear to be credible and are not controverted by any corroborating evidence to the\ncontrary. Likewise, allegations of poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s 2016 termination are unsubstantiated. \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBetween 2013 and 2017, Applicant accumulated 13 delinquent debts exceeding\n$11,500 according to his most recent credit reports. (GEs 4-6 and 7) Applicant attributed\nthese debts to periods of unemployment and not paying enough attention to addressing\nhis creditor obligations in a timely way. (GE 2; Tr. 50-53) With the responsibilities he has\nin caring for his wife and children as a sole provider, he has not been in a position to\naddress his debts. His available income sources have been further attenuated by the\nmonies he has committed to helping his parents in Afghanistan. (Tr. 50-53)\nSince his hearing, Applicant has provided documentation of addressing several of\nhis smaller debts. He provided proof of his unsuccessful contact effort to establish\npayment arrangement with SOR creditor 1.a (who holds a delinquent debt of $3,235).\n(AE H) He provided documented proof, too, of resolving the following debts: SOR debts\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c (with a $130 payment in satisfaction of the reported $1,040 debt); 1.e (with a $100\npayment in satisfaction of $416 debt); 1.h (with a $76 payment); and 1.k (a $211\npayment in satisfaction of $681debt). (AEs H-K) Payment totals for these debts total\n$517 on listed aggregate amounts of $2,213. This still leaves unresolved debts\nexceeding $9,700. Among his remaining debts are two judgments: one entered in June\n9\n\n2014 for $2,009 (SOR debt \u00b6 1.i) and another entered in April 2014 for $1,331 (SOR\ndebt \u00b6 1.j). At this time, he could provide no firm plans for addressing his remaining\ndebts with the income sources currently available to him. (Tr. 33)\nEndorsements and Awards\nApplicant is highly regarded by high-ranking U.S. officials and senior military\ncommanders who worked closely with Applicant during Afghan military operations\nbetween 2002 and 2008. (AEs A and G) Senior U.S. officials credited Applicant with\nexceptional translation work while working in sensitive roles as an Embassy translator.\n(A-D) Senior military members credited Applicant with superb translation services in\npositions requiring high trust while embedded with military commands operating in\nAfghanistan. (AEs E and G) They expressed their appreciation for his extraordinary\nlinguist support that consistently exceeded their expectations. (AEs E and G) Each of the\nArmy commanders he worked closely with in combat missions characterized hm as a\nlinguist with strong character traits that served him well in the performance of his duties.\n(AEs E and G)\nFormer coworkers and family members who know Applicant attest to his strong\nwork ethic and overall good character. (AE M) They credited him with traits of honesty\nand integrity.\nApplicant  earned numerous certificates of merit achievement and appreciation\nfrom the  military commands he worked closely with while assigned to Afghanistan. (AE\nF) These awards express gratitude for Applicant\u2019s commitment and achievements to his\nmilitary commands while working foreign translation assignments. (AE F) \nPolicies\nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the\nconditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied.  Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive\nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in\narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(d) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context\nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period\n10\n\nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the\napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to,\nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a security concern if they result in divided\nallegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create circumstances in\nwhich the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign\ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest\nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is known to\ntarget U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.   See AG \u00b6 6.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or\nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful\nand candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. . .,\nAG \u00b6 15. \nFinancial Considerations\n The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress\ncan also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health\nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of dependence. An individual who is\n11\n\nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise\nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511\n(1995)  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a highly regarded former linguist who currently works for a U.S.-\nbased defense contractor in an administrative capacity. He is an Afghan citizen by\nbirth and a naturalized U.S. citizen with permanent residency in the United States.\nForeign influence concerns relate to Applicant\u2019s having immediate and extended\nfamily members who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan, a country with a\nsomewhat checkered history of wars, political instability, and violence. \nAdditional security concerns are raised with respect to Applicant\u2019s previous\nterminations with company A and with Company B. Applicant\u2019s history of problems\nwith managing his finances also raises security concerns.  \n12\n\nForeign influence concerns\nDespite encouraging efforts in the development of strategic partnerships\nbetween Afghanistan and the United States in recent years, Afghanistan remains a\nwar-torn country and one still in the process of establishing a stable democratic\ngovernment that is able to build effective, honest, and loyal provincial and district\ninstitutions, provide effective protections for its constituent groups, and maintain cross-\nborder security. The historically close relationship between Applicant and his\nimmediate family members who reside in Afghanistan makes them potentially\nvulnerable to coercion and non-coercive measures.  \nBecause Taliban, Al Qaida, and Haqqani Network insurgents operating in\nAfghanistan have a history of violating Afghan domestic laws and regulations, as well\nas international laws, they are more likely to use improper and illegal means, or one of\nthe other, to obtain classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control through\nhis family members still residing in Afghanistan. DC \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of\nmethod, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion,\u201d applies.   \nTo date, none of Applicant\u2019s parents, three brothers, and mother-in-law residing\nin Afghanistan have any history of being subjected to any coercion or influence. These\nhistorical antecedents do limit the severity of any potential conflict situation. However,\nthe absence of any past coercive measures taken by Afghan authorities does not\ncompletely absolve Applicant from coercive risks in the future given Afghanistan\u2019s \nconsiderable history of wars, political instability, violence, hostage taking, and abusive\nmeasures taken against its own citizens.  For these reasons, \u00b6 DC 7(b), \u201cconnections\nto a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information or technology,\u201d has some application to Applicant and his\nfamily members residing in Afghanistan. \nStill, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members have any known current\naffiliations or connections with the Afghan government or their military, or any other\nforeign government. Any potential conflict that might be associated with his sisters\npresents a low risk and not likely to pose any conflicts of interest for Applicant in the\nforeseeable future. \nAs a nation, Afghanistan continues to be a country with emerging strategic\nrelationships with the United States and is a front-line partner in the war on terror. \nBecause of the security dangers that still confront U.S. and Afghanistan forces\noperating in the region, Afghanistan remains a country that presents a heightened risk. \nAfghanistan is also a country that is benefitting from long-term U.S. commitments to\nhelp the Afghan government and its tribal regions reconstitute and rebuild their\ninstitutions and infrastructure in the aftermath of years of war, human rights abuses, \n13\n\nand political and economic mismanagement under Soviet-backed regimes and Taliban\nrule. Given the current geopolitical infrastructure that exists in Afghanistan, the risk of\na pressure or influence situation involving an immediate or extended family member of\nApplicant\u2019s can be characterized as somewhat reduced, commensurate with improved\nsecurity and political conditions on the ground in the country. \nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of\nforeign countries in general. What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one\nforeign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical\nnecessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Afghanistan. The\nAGs take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the United States as\nan important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship\nand residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk.\nApplicant\u2019s situation is a special one for reasons that pertain wholly to his\nunique status and circumstances as a linguist working with diplomatic personnel and\nmilitary commands operating in Afghanistan. Not only has he been careful to avoid\nany frequent contact with his sisters and in-laws in Afghanistan, but he has been\nscrupulous about making certain his family members are not aware of his linguist\nassignments and duties that cover Afghan culture and political conditions. \nIn special circumstances involving linguists who put themselves in harm\u2019s way\nby working in unstable countries where they have family members residing, the\nAppeal Board has been quick to note that such individuals are more likely to\nrecognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or\ninsurgent group at coercion or exploitation. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App.\nBd. Feb. 5, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s strong connections to the United States and to his wife\nand children, his record of distinguished service as a linguist for high U.S. officials and\nmilitary commands operating in Afghanistan make it highly unlikely he would ever\nresolve any potential conflict against his U.S. interests.  \nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United\nStates,\u201d is available to Applicant. Balancing security interests associated with\nApplicant\u2019s Afghanistan-based family members, conclusions warrant that neither\nApplicant nor his immediate or extended family members residing in Afghanistan pose\nany heightened security risks that could subject them to potential pressures and\ninfluence from Afghan  government and military officials. \nOf benefit to Applicant, too, is  MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or\nallegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\n14\n\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments\nto the United States are well demonstrated and sufficient under these circumstances\nto neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his relationships with his\nimmediate and extended family residing in Afghanistan.   \nTwo other mitigating conditions have application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  MC \u00b6\u00b6\n8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d\nand 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used\neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d are fully applicable.\nApplicant has no current property or other financial interests in Afghanistan, and there\nis an uncertain likelihood of his ever acquiring any inheritance rights in the country that\ncould create any conflicts in the foreseeable future. What is known about his parents\nis that they have modest resources and receive some financial support from Applicant. \nPersonal conduct concerns\nBased on the absence of any corroborating evidence to challenge Applicant\u2019s\naccounts of the facts and circumstances surrounding his terminations from Companies\nA and B in 2015 and 2016, respectively, allegations of misconduct attributed to\nApplicant in both instances are neither corroborated nor substantiated. Applicant\u2019s full\naccounts are accepted as the most credible versions of the events that transpired\nleading up to his terminations. \nFinancial concerns\nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts between 2014 and 2016. Altogether, Applicant accumulated over\n$12,000 in delinquent debts over a three-year period (2014-2016) that he has not\nsufficiently addressed to date to absolve himself of security concerns. Applicant\u2019s debt\ndelinquencies warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts negate the need for any independent\nproof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006).\nEach of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts are fully documented and create some judgment\nissues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is\nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance\nthat entitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a\nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to\n15\n\ncoercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax\nfiling lapses and debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing debt delinquencies are critical to an\nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in\nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified\ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App.\nBd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).\nApplicant\u2019s cited extenuating circumstances (i.e., past unemployment and periodic\nremittances to his parents in Afghanistan) are extenuating and entitle Applicant to\npartial mitigation  credit for his inability to address his debt delinquencies. \nMC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has partial application to Applicant\u2019s\nsituation. His failure to more of his debt delinquencies after he returned to full time\nemployment status in December 2016 precludes him, however, from taking more\nadvantage of the \u201cacted responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6 20(b).\nSatisfaction of Applicant\u2019s evidentiary burden of providing probative evidence of\nhis addressing his debt delinquencies requires more documentation of his working\npayment efforts than he has provided in his submissions. While his extenuating\ncircumstances are highly probative, they are not enough to mitigate his major financial\ndelinquencies without more evidence of past and recent efforts to address more of his\ndelinquent debts than he has been able to do with the income sources available to him\nwith his full-time employment. While his post-hearing efforts of addressing several of\nhis smaller creditors are encouraging, they still leave unresolved over 85% of his listed \ncreditors without any documented concrete plans to resolve them.\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of\nfederal and state tax debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his failures or inability to establish documented payment initiatives \nwith his listed SOR creditors, both before and after the initiation of the security\nclearance process, prelude favorable findings and conclusions with respect to raised\nsecurity concerns over the state of his finances.  \nWhole-person assessment\nTo complete a  whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence and\nfinancial risks to ascertain whether they are fully compatible with minimum security\nclearance eligibility requirements, Applicant\u2019s substantial civilian contributions to U.S.\nsecurity interests as an Afghan linguist between 2002 and 2008 require careful\nbalancing with the raised security concerns. Applicant\u2019s endorsements and certificates\nof appreciation attest to his valuable contributions to U.S. military and diplomatic\n16\n\nservices operating in Afghanistan. They are impressive and warrant considerable\nappreciation for his contributions to U.S. security interests. \nWhole-person assessment is available also to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nconflicts of interests with his Afghan family members. So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the\npotential risk of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought to bear on him, or any\nof his respective family members residing in Afghanistan, is very low and mitigated.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s past contributions to U.S. security interests (impressive as they\nare) are not enough at this time to mitigate security concerns over the state of his\nfinances.  Without more evidence of payment initiatives, it is still too soon to make\nsafe predictions that Applicant can gain control of and consistently manage his\nfinancial affairs in a stable manner.   \nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):      AGAINST APPLICANT\n     Subparagraphs 1.b-1.d, 1.f-1.g, 1.I -1.j, 1.l-1.m:     Against Applicant\n     \n     Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.k:                     For Applicant     \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):                    FOR APPLICANT\n     Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:\n                               For Applicant    \n        \nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\n          FOR APPLICANT\n    Subparagraphs 3.a-3.d:                                            For Applicant\n \n Conclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 10, 2017, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On September 13, \n2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of \ninterrogatories, essentially to verify the accuracy of his Enhanced Subject Interview of \nMarch 28, 2017. On October 23, 2017, he did so, with corrections. On November 7, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \n01/17/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), \nG (Alcohol Consumption), F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct), and \ndetailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 17, 2017. In a sworn statement, dated \nDecember 5, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on January 3, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 20, \n2018. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for July \n26, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 6 and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE F were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 7, 2018. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He failed to take advantage of that opportunity. The \nrecord closed on August 23, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, nearly all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., \nand 1.f. through 1.j.); and financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. through 3.i., and 3.k. \nthrough 3.q.). He failed to admit or deny the allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption, \nso a denial was registered for him. He denied, with comments, all of the remaining \nallegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving, \nfirst as the manager, web business, and currently as an application systems developer, \nwith his current employer since May 1999. A 1990 high school graduate, Applicant earned \nsome college credits, but no degree. He has never served in the U.S. military. He has \nnever held a security clearance, but has been occupying a position of public trust since \n1999. Applicant was married in 1993. He has three children, born in 1993, 1995, and \n1998, respectively, and is now a grandfather. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nCriminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nApplicant starting consuming alcohol when he was 15-years old. He eventually \ngenerally drank 12 12-ounce beers over a three-day weekend, every weekend, or an \nunspecified amount of alcohol every other day, to feel calm and relaxed. He estimated \nthat a half-pint of liquor and a 12-pack of beer would make him feel intoxicated. He \nbecame intoxicated monthly. Applicant acknowledged that he is an alcoholic, but he \ncontends that he stopped drinking alcohol in about June 2016.1 He indicated that after \nthe 2013 incident, described below, he obtained counseling assistance from the \nEmployee Association Program (EAP), and he attended five sessions with a certified \npsychologist. He was referred to Alcohol Anonymous (AA). He claimed that he regularly \nattends Alcohol Anonymous (AA) three times per week, but acknowledged that he has \nnot been to an AA meeting during the three weeks leading up to the hearing; he has an \nAA sponsor; and he attends an unspecified number of church-related Adult Children of \nAlcoholics (ACOA) counseling sessions with a spiritual advisor. ACOA is an organization \nintended to provide a forum for individuals who desire to recover from the effects of \ngrowing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family.  \n \nApplicant stated an intention of never picking up another drink in his life, but if he \nfails in doing so, he believes he has a strong foundation and support network to help him \nget back on the right track.2 Applicant failed to submit any documentation or witnesses to \nsupport his contentions that: (1) he no longer consumes alcohol, and the date he stopped \nconsuming it; (2) he attends AA, or the nature of his participation; or (3) he attends ACOA, \nand the nature and frequency of the meetings and counseling sessions. \n \nThe SOR alleged one incident of criminality by Applicant in 1991, and another \nseven incidents over a period 14 years, commencing in 2001 and continuing until 2015. \nAt least three of those incidents were alcohol-related:  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): In April 1991, one month shy of his 19th birthday, Applicant was \narrested and charged with Attempt to Commit Robbery, Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, \nand Simple Assault. The two robbery-related charges were dismissed, and Applicant pled \nguilty to Simple Assault. He was placed on probation for two years;3 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): In July 2001, Applicant was charged with Driving Without a License, \na misdemeanor, as opposed to the charge Driving Under Suspension (DUS).

The sentence was not \nreported;4  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.): In August 2006, Applicant was charged with Driving Without a \nLicense, a misdemeanor, once again as opposed to the charge DUS. He again denied \nbeing aware that his operator\u2019s license had been suspended, and he thought it had been \ntransferred to his current state of residence during a \u201cperiod of transition.\u201d The disposition \nof the charge was not reported;5 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.): In December 2006, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence (DUI), Driving Without a License, and Violation ABC Law, all misdemeanors, \nafter losing control of his vehicle on an Interstate highway and striking a guard rail, \nbreaking his neck. Once again, he was not charged with DUS. In this instance, Applicant \nacknowledged that he lost his operator\u2019s license because of excessive parking tickets.6 \nHe also acknowledged that he had consumed four or five 12-ounce beers before he \ndrove.7 Although the disposition of the charges was not reported in the FBI Identification \nRecord,8 Applicant indicated that he was fined;9  \n \n (SOR \u00b6 1.e.): In April 2007, Applicant was charged with Fraudulent Check Under \n$500 \u2013 1st, a misdemeanor. Although Applicant denied that he was ever formally charged \nwith a crime related to the \u201cinadvertently bounced\u201d check, he was, in fact, convicted of the \ncharge and fined $93.73;10 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.): In November 2012, Applicant was charged with DUS, a \nmisdemeanor.

The DUS \ncharge was nolle prossed, and the disposition of the other charges was not reported. \nApplicant contended that upon his successful completion of a court ordered DUI program, \nlasting four days per week for a period of one year, with random urinalysis, and total \nalcohol abstinence, his DUI would be expunged. He claimed he successfully completed \nthe program in November 2017,13 but he failed to submit any documentation about the \nprogram, his participation in the program, or his successful completion of the program. \n                                                          \n \nA person who drives a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State when the person's \nlicense to drive is canceled, suspended, or revoked must, upon conviction, be punished as \nfollows: \n \n(a) for a first offense, fined three hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to thirty days, or both; \n(b) for a second offense, fined six hundred dollars or imprisoned for up to sixty consecutive \ndays, or both; and (c) for a third or subsequent offense, fined one thousand dollars, and \nimprisoned for up to ninety days or confined to a person's place of residence pursuant to \nthe Home Detention Act for up to ninety days. No portion of a term of imprisonment or \nconfinement under home detention may be suspended by the trial judge except when the \ncourt is suspending a term of imprisonment upon successful completion of the terms and \nconditions of confinement under home detention.

The department may issue the route restricted \ndriver's license only upon a showing by the person that the person is employed or enrolled \nin a college or university and that the person lives further than one mile from the person's \nplace of employment or place of education. \n \n12 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3. \n \n13 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 3; Tr. at 52-54. According to the \nstate statute covering the cited charge: \n \nAn habitual offender shall mean any person whose record as maintained by the \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles shows that he has accumulated the convictions for separate \nand distinct offenses described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) committed during a three-\nyear period; provided, that where more than one included offense shall be committed within \na one-day period such multiple offenses shall be treated for the purposes of this article as \none offense: \n \n(a) Three or more convictions, singularly or in combination of any of the following separate \nand distinct offenses arising out of separate acts: (1) Voluntary manslaughter, involuntary \nmanslaughter or reckless homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle; (2) \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nApplicant claimed that over an extended period of years, especially when his \noperator\u2019s license was suspended, or when he did not actually have a license, he rarely \ndrove his vehicle. He said he got to work as part of a car pool with his wife or others \ndriving, and on other occasions when the children were in the car, also with his wife \ndriving. He noted that on some of occasions, such as when he was stopped by the police, \nor during an emergency situation with a sick child, he was not accompanied by his wife.14 \n \nApplicant also attributed the reasons for the suspensions of his operator\u2019s license \nto the parking issues; tax liens; failure to pay property tax on the vehicle; or the \ncancellation of his automobile insurance.15 During the hearing, Applicant stated that he \ncurrently does not have an operator\u2019s license as it was suspended because of his \ndesignation as a habitual traffic offender.16 \n \nFinancial Considerations17 \n  \nApplicant acknowledged that when he started his family at the age of 21, he did \nnot understand the value of a dollar or what exactly \u201ccredit\u201d meant. That lack of \nunderstanding, coupled with his \u201calcoholism,\u201d left him in a financial hole. He claimed to \nhave hired a credit repair company to assist him in rebuilding his credit, essentially by \ndisputing most of the delinquent accounts listed in his credit reports, as well as financial \nadvisors to help him spend his money wisely.18 He failed to submit documentation to \n                                                          \nOperating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating \nliquor, narcotics or drugs; (3) Driving or operating a motor vehicle in a reckless manner; (4) \nDriving a motor vehicle while his license, permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has \nbeen suspended or revoked, except a conviction for driving under suspension for failure to \nfile proof of financial responsibility; (5) Any offense punishable as a felony under the motor \nvehicle laws of this State or any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;  \n(6) Failure of the driver of a motor vehicle involved in any accident resulting in the death or \ninjury of any person to stop close to the scene of such accident and report his identity; \n \n(b) Ten or more convictions of separate and distinct offenses involving moving violations \nsingularly or in combination, in the operation of a motor vehicle, which are required to be \nreported to the department for which four or more points are assigned pursuant to [the \nstatute] or which are enumerated in subsection (a) of this section. \n \n(c) The offenses included in subsections (a) and (b) shall be deemed to include offenses \nunder any federal law, any law of another state or any municipal or county ordinance of \nanother state substantially conforming to the above provisions. \n \n14 Tr. at 32, 42-43, 60. \n \n15 Tr. at 39-41. \n \n16 Tr. at 28-29, 58-59. \n \n17 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: GE 2, supra note 1; GE 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit \nReport, dated March 7, 2017); GE 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 30, 2017); AE A (Credit Plus \nCredit Report, dated July 12, 2018); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.   \n  \n18 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nsupport his claims that a credit repair company had been hired; the identity of that \ncompany; what that company had actually done for him or in his behalf; that financial \nadvisors had been hired; the identity of the financial advisors; or what type of guidance \nthey had furnished him. Additionally, aside from Applicant\u2019s lack or financial knowledge, \ncoupled with his alcoholism, it is unclear how or when his financial problems first \nemerged.  \nIn February 2005, Applicant and his wife filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy \nunder Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and in September 2007, that bankruptcy \nwas discharged after the Bankruptcy Trustee had disbursed $36,854.20 to various \ncreditors, including the U.S. Treasury and the state department of revenue.19  \nDespite the bankruptcy discharge and the relative abatement of his financial issues \nassociated with the Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s rejection of various accounts, within three \nyears, Applicant\u2019s financial problems mushroomed once again. In 2010, the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) notified him that because of errors in his income tax returns he \nowed the IRS between $10,000 and $20,000, and a voluntary repayment plan withdrawal \nwas established, ending in approximately 2014-2015. In 2011 and 2012, several accounts \nbecame delinquent, and over the ensuing years, even more accounts became \ndelinquent.20 In 2014, a number of tax liens were filed against him.21 \nIn addition to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the SOR identified 16 purportedly \ndelinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, as generally \nreflected by Applicant\u2019s March 2017 or October 2017 credit reports. Those debts total \napproximately $12,275. The current status of those accounts is as follows: \nThere has been no change in the status of a vast majority of Applicant\u2019s accounts \nthat were placed for collection. While many of them were unsuccessfully disputed for \nreasons not explained, the following accounts remain unaddressed and unresolved, as \nacknowledged by Applicant: various medical accounts with unpaid balances of $90 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b.); $125 (SOR \u00b6 1.c.), $561 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.); $225 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.); $85 (SOR \u00b6 1.k.); $415 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.n.); and $760 (SOR \u00b6 1.o.); and other accounts: two bank-issued credit-card \n                                                          \n \n19 GE 3 (Bankruptcy Petition and Final Report and Account, various dates). \n \n20 GE 2, supra note 1, at 6; GE 5, supra note 17.  \n \n21 GE 5, supra note 17, at 5-7; Tr. at 69-72. Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain \npurposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: \n(a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or \nchanged circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide \nevidence for whole-person analysis under Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at \n3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged delinquent accounts and tax liens will be considered only for the \nfive purposes listed above.  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \naccounts with unpaid balances that were charged off in the amounts of $179 (SOR \u00b6 1.l.) \nand $171 (SOR \u00b6 1.m.); a cable-television account with an unpaid balance of $689 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.p.); and a fitness center account with an unpaid balance of $2,090, that Applicant \nintends to start making unspecified payments to in August 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.q.).22     \nThere are also some accounts that Applicant claims he has either made payments \nto, or has paid them off. There are three medical accounts with unpaid balances of $162 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.); $85 (SOR \u00b6 1.g.); and $51 (SOR \u00b6 1.h.).23 Applicant\u2019s most recent credit \nreport reflects seven delinquent medical accounts with the same collection agent. Only \nthree of those accounts are alleged in the SOR. Applicant submitted a May 2018 receipt \nfrom the collection agent, in the amount of $405.66,24 and he contended that the payment \ncovered all of the delinquent accounts with that one collection agent. He submitted three \nletters from the collection agent indicating that ten different accounts, including the three \nlisted in the SOR had been settled in full.25 AE B refers to the three SOR-related accounts. \nThose three accounts have been resolved. \nThe two remaining accounts refer to a lease with an unpaid balance of $6,507 due \nto damage (SOR \u00b6 1.i.) that was placed for collection; and a student loan with an unpaid \nbalance of $80 (SOR \u00b6 1.j.).26 With respect to the former account, Applicant contends that \nhe reached out to the creditor and agreed to a repayment plan under which, starting in \nMarch 2018, he would pay $100 per month.27 Regarding the latter account, he contended \nthat he paid the creditor the outstanding amount in June or July 2018.28 Applicant failed \nto submit documentation to support his contentions that payments had been made to \neither creditor, even though he indicated that he would do so if the record would be kept \nopen. In the absence of such documentation, neither account has been resolved. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant was requested to complete a Personal Financial \nStatement to reflect his monthly net income; monthly expenses; and a monthly remainder \navailable for discretionary saving or spending. He failed to do so. However, during the \nhearing, he acknowledged that his annual salary was about $74,000 and his wife\u2019s annual \nsalary was about $125,000, for a total of approximately $200,000.29 He has less than \n$1,000 in his 401(k), after withdrawing $10,000 in anticipation of closing on his new \n                                                          \n22 GE 5, supra note 17; GE 6, supra note 17; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; Tr. at \n78-80, 93-97. \n \n23 GE 5, supra note 17; GE 6, supra note 17; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1.  \n \n24 AE E (Receipt, dated May 17, 2018). \n \n25 AE B (Letter, dated May 17, 2018); AE C (Letter, dated May 17, 2018); AE D (Letter, dated May \n17, 2018); Tr. at 80-90. \n \n26 GE 5, supra note 17; GE 6, supra note 17; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1. \n \n27 Tr. at 90-92. \n \n28 Tr. at 91-93. \n \n29 Tr. at 101. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nresidence; and less than $1,000 at the end of each month for discretionary saving or \nspending.30 He purchased a new hybrid sport-utility vehicle (SUV) for his wife in 2016. In \nresponse to a question as to why he failed to make more progress with modest or \nminimum delinquent debts with a combined annual income of $200,000, Applicant could \nnot respond, claiming that because \u201cwe have a ton of bills,\u201d they are trying to adjust their \nfinances. Applicant disputed certain accounts solely because he disagreed with the \namounts reflected. He was unable to explain why his finances went into such disarray \nbefore 2005 as to justify his filing for bankruptcy; and he was unable to explain why his \nfinances deteriorated in 2007 to create his current delinquencies. Although the record \nremained open, he also failed to furnish a requested updated status of his SOR-related \naccounts supported by receipts, checks, or letters related to those debts; and a copy of \nhis repayment plan showing any priority for addressing his delinquent accounts.  \nPersonal Conduct31 \n(SOR \u00b6 4.a.): This allegation cross-references the SOR allegations associated with \nhis criminal conduct and alcohol consumption. \n(SOR \u00b6 4.b.):  On January 10, 2017, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he \nresponded to certain questions pertaining to his police record found in Section 22. Those \nquestions requested certain information regardless of whether the record in his case had \nbeen sealed, expunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was \ndismissed. Certain convictions, not relevant here, did not need to be reported. Those \nquestions were essentially as follows: In the past seven years have you been: a. issued \na summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against you?; b. \narrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal, or any other type of law enforcement \nofficial?; c. charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any court?; and d. or are you \ncurrently on probation or parole? In addition, are you currently on trial or awaiting a trial \non criminal charges? Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the combined questions, and he \nreported the incident from 2013 in which he said he was charged with DUI, but reduced \nto Reckless Driving, and ordered to pay a fine.32 He omitted the 2013 DUS charge, the \nNovember 2012 DUS charge; and the December 2015 DUI, DUS, and Felony Habitual \nTraffic Offender charges. He certified that his responses to those questions were \u201ctrue, \ncomplete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, because of his \nomissions, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.  \nApplicant subsequently offered differing explanations for the omissions. He either \ndid not recall the 2012 or 2015 incidents; did not consider traffic incidents to be criminal; \n                                                          \n30 Tr. at 102-107. \n \n31 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 4.a. by deleting that portion of \nthe allegation that reads \u201cand 3.a. through 3.q.\u201d There being no objection, the motion was granted, and the \nSOR was amended as indicated. See Tr. at 135-138. \n \n32 GE 1 (e-QIP, dated January 10, 2017), at 24-25; Tr. at 120-128. \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nmisinterpreted the questions; or his claimed, but otherwise unconfirmed, stroke interfered \nwith his recollections. He denied deliberately failing to disclose the omitted information. \n(SOR \u00b6 4.c.): On January 10, 2017, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he also \nresponded to certain questions pertaining to his finances found in Section 26. Those \nquestions asked if, in the past seven years, he had any bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency; or he had any account or credit card suspended or cancelled for failing \nto pay as agreed. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to each of the questions.33 He certified that his \nresponses to those questions were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his \nknowledge and belief, but the responses to those questions were, in fact, false. He \nomitted every one of the 16 delinquent accounts that were eventually alleged in the SOR \nas well as the tax issues that were not alleged; even though those tax liens were not \nresolved until 2014, well within the seven-year period of interest. \nApplicant subsequently offered differing explanations for the omissions.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d39 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.40  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.41 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, his testimony, as well as an assessment of \nApplicant=s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal \nprecepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR: \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise trustworthiness \nconcerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant has established a lengthy pattern of criminality involving felonies and \nmisdemeanors. There is one incident of criminality by Applicant in 1991, and another \nseven incidents over a period 14 years, commencing in 2001 and continuing until 2015. \nThey include a variety of charges, police involvement, court involvement, and sentences. \n                                                          \n41 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nSome charges were dismissed or nolle prossed. With one exception, he admitted the \nallegations, and for that one allegation to which he claimed that he was not formally \ncharged with a crime, the evidence is clear that he was, in fact, convicted of the charge \nand fined $93.73. Applicant\u2019s willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations is \nsuspect, for he routinely ignored the law when he consistently drove a vehicle without a \nlicense, under suspension, or under the influence, for such a lengthy period. That is why \nhe has been identified as a Felony Habitual Traffic Offender \u2013 a designation that still \napplies to him. It appears that such a designation is akin to a probation. Furthermore, \nApplicant admitted that on rare occasions, he operated a vehicle without a valid operator\u2019s \nlicense in emergencies and at other times.  It is troubling that the information pertaining \nto the alleged crimes was offered only through the incomplete FBI information record, \nwithout police reports, or court records. Nevertheless, while the information of criminality \nis of poor quality, it has generally been \u201cadmitted\u201d by Applicant, raising that information to \nthe level of substantial evidence. Accordingly, based on the actions described above, AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense;  \nand  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. While a substantial period may have \nelapsed since the robbery/assault-related incident occurred in 1991, Applicant\u2019s other \nmore recent criminal behavior commenced in 2001 and continued until at least December \n2015. He is a recidivist, displaying a long pattern of DUS, DUI, and driving without a \nlicense violations, despite periodic police and court involvement. Furthermore, he is still \ndesignated as a Felony Habitual Traffic Offender. Applicant appears to have a good \nemployment record, but without the requested documentation about the DUI program, his \nparticipation in the program, or his successful completion of the program in November \n2017, I am unable to determine if he has actually successfully completed the program.  \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, the most recent criminal conduct is two years ago. Given his cavalier \nattitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nunder the circumstances, continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is \nset forth in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. \nEventually, Applicant generally drank 12 12-ounce beers over a three-day weekend, \nevery weekend, or an unspecified amount of alcohol every other day, to feel calm and \nrelaxed. He acknowledged that he became intoxicated monthly. He also acknowledged \nthat he is an alcoholic. His use of alcohol has, directly or indirectly, led to a number of \nincidents that resulted in actions taken by police and court authorities. He was repeatedly \ncharged with some alcohol-related charges \u2013 three DUIs \u2013 as well as more isolated open \ncontainer and violation of ABC law. While some of those charges were reduced or \ndismissed, several charges resulted in convictions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) have been \nestablished, but none of the other conditions have been established. \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes several examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that \ncould mitigate trustworthiness concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) partially applies, but none of the remaining conditions apply. Because \nof their relative recency, Applicant\u2019s 2013 and 2015 DUIs are the most significant, as far \nas his trustworthiness review is concerned. Applicant\u2019s behavior, stemming from his \nassociation with alcohol, has not been infrequent, and the circumstances developed do \nnot appear to be unusual. While Applicant now acknowledges his pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, for far too long he seemingly gave lip-service to it. He contends that he has \nbeen abstinent since June 2016. He also claims to have successfully completed various \nalcohol-related programs and that he is currently participating in other alcohol-related \nprograms, but without the requested documentation regarding those programs and his \npurported participation in them, it is impossible to determine what his participation has \nbeen. There is no evidence that he was ever diagnosed by a qualified medical or mental \nhealth professional for alcohol use disorder, and there is no evidence regarding what the \ntreatment recommendations may have been.  \n \nBecause of his lengthy history of maladaptive alcohol use, questions regarding his \nabstinence, and his irregular attendance at AA, there remain significant questions as to \nwhether such maladaptive alcohol use will recur. Nevertheless, Applicant should be \nencouraged to remain abstinent for a much longer period. He has failed to demonstrate \na clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence, and under the \ncircumstances, there remain doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(d) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode in 2005, and the bankruptcy was discharged in 2007. He claimed that he did not \nunderstand the value of a dollar or what exactly \u201ccredit\u201d meant. That lack of \nunderstanding, coupled with his \u201calcoholism,\u201d left him in a financial hole. Despite the \nbankruptcy discharge and the relative abatement of his financial issues associated with \nthe Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s rejection of various accounts, within three years, Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems mushroomed once again. In addition to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, \nthe SOR identified 16 delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $12,275, that had been \nplaced for collection or charged off. There has been no change in the status of a vast \nmajority of Applicant\u2019s accounts that were placed for collection. While many of them were \nunsuccessfully disputed for reasons not explained, nearly all of the accounts remain \nunaddressed and unresolved, as acknowledged by Applicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(d) have been established. AG \u00b6 19(b) has been partially established because, with a \ncombined annual family income of $200,000, it is unclear why he failed to make more \nprogress with modest or minimum delinquent debts, or if he was simply unwilling to do \nso.  \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;42 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;43 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) minimally apply, but none of the remaining conditions apply. \nApplicant claimed he hired a credit repair company to assist him in rebuilding his credit, \nessentially by disputing most of the delinquent accounts listed in his credit reports, as well \n                                                          \n42 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n43 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \nas financial advisors to help him spend his money wisely. As noted above, he failed to \nsubmit documentation to support his claims that a credit repair company had been hired; \nthe identity of that company; what that company had actually done for him or in his behalf; \nthat financial advisors had been hired; the identity of the financial advisors; or what type \nof guidance they had furnished him. Additionally, aside from Applicant\u2019s lack or financial \nknowledge, coupled with his alcoholism, it is unclear how or when his financial problems \nfirst emerged. Although the record remained open, he also failed to furnish a requested \nupdated status of his SOR-related accounts supported by receipts, checks, or letters \nrelated to those debts; and a copy of his repayment plan showing any priority for \naddressing his delinquent accounts.  \nApplicant seemingly took little action to resolve his delinquent SOR-related debts \nuntil after the SOR was issued. He offered no documentation to indicate that he sought \ninformation from his creditors or collection agents,44 or by obtaining financial counseling \nand credit resolution guidance and assistance. He made arrangements with the state tax \nauthority regarding tax liens that were not alleged in the SOR, and there is evidence that \nhe satisfied those liens. But, with a healthy combined annual income, he could not \nmotivate himself to pay off delinquent debts of $80, $85, $90, $125, or $171. The few \nrelatively modest medical accounts were not resolved until six months after the SOR was \nissued and two months before the hearing was conducted. Applicant offered substantial \nevidence to indicate that his combined annual income is excellent, but little evidence to \nindicate that his financial situation is now under better control, especially considering his \ncomment that \u201cwe have a ton of bills.\u201d Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.45 \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, with minor \nexceptions, Applicant\u2019s promises have not transitioned into positive action. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n44 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \n45 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n19 \n                                      \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise trustworthiness \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, and \nfinancial considerations are adopted herein. At the time Applicant completed his e-QIP in \nJanuary 2017, he concealed and omitted DUIs from 2012 and 2015; and denied having \nfinancial issues, although there were numerous delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n20 \n                                      \n \ncomments provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions were deliberate \nfalsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely inaccurate answers that were the result of \noversight or misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Proof of incorrect answers, \nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when \nthe falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the alleged \nfalsifications or omissions occurred. I have considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s initial and subsequent comments.46 Applicant\u2019s explanations for his \nsubmissions, in my view, are simply not persuasive evidence of Applicant\u2019s actual intent. \nIn addition, aside from his lack of candor with respect to the QIP, there is Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy history of criminality. As to the deliberate falsifications on the e-QIP regarding the \npolice record and financial record, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (a) and 16(c) have been established. As to \nthe combined criminal conduct and alcohol consumption allegations, AG \u00b6 16 (c) has \nbeen established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s lengthy criminal history continued until \nat least December 2015; his pattern of maladaptive alcohol use continued until at least \nJune 2016; and his false responses to the e-QIP inquiries occurred in January 2017. \nApplicant was confronted with the true facts by an investigator in March 2017, but before \nthat interview, he apparently made no efforts to correct the omissions, concealments, or \nfalsifications. Far from being infrequent, Applicant\u2019s maladaptive alcohol use was routine \n                                                          \n46 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden \nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant\u2019s level of \neducation and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to \ndisclose [significant facts] on an application was deliberate).  \n \n\n \n21 \n                                      \n \nfor decades, and his attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations also lasted for a lengthy \nperiod. Furthermore, three DUIs and multiple DUSs and driving without a license, while \nmisdemeanors, are not minor offenses, and his continuing designation as a Felony \nHabitual Traffic Offender, is also not insignificant. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.47 \n \n There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a \n46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving, first as the manager, web \nbusiness, and currently as an application systems developer, with his current employer \nsince May 1999. He is a high school graduate, with some college credits, but no degree. \nHe has been occupying a position of public trust since 1999. Applicant is married, and \nhas three children. He is a grandfather. Applicant has purportedly made efforts to remove \nhimself from the clutches of alcohol, and he claims that he has been abstinent since June \n2016. \n \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a self-proclaimed alcoholic, and a justice-involved individual whose history of \ncriminal conduct took place with one incident of criminality in 1991, and another seven \nincidents over a period 14 years, commencing in 2001 and continuing until 2015. His \nfinances are in disarray, with one bankruptcy under Chapter 13 discharged in 2007; and \na renewed history of delinquent accounts that still remain unaddressed by him, despite a \n                                                          \n47 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n22 \n                                      \n \ncombined annual income of approximately $200,000. Although he claimed to have taken \ncertain positive actions to address his creditors and delinquent accounts; and attended \ncertain programs associated with his consumption of alcohol, Applicant failed to submit \nrequested documentation to support his various claims and contentions.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:48 \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a poor track record of debt reduction and elimination \nefforts, essentially failing to address most of his SOR-related debts. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nposition of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe trustworthiness concerns arising from his criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, \nfinancial considerations, and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through \nAG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n                                                          \n48 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n23 \n                                      \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3.q.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a. through 4.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of \npublic trust to support a contract with the DOD.

I have treated his answer to these allegations as denials. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.b, 3.b, and 3.d. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.c.

Morris, Esq. \n09/18/2019 \nDecision \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines I (Psychological \nConditions), G (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant mitigated \nthe Guideline G and E security concerns, but he has not mitigated the Guideline I \nsecurity concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 1, 2014. \nAfter an extensive background investigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February \n20, 2019, alleging security concerns under Guidelines I, G, and E. The DOD CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n\n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 22, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 19, 2019, \nand the case was assigned to me on April 23, 2019. On May 8, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 12, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, presented the testimony of five witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through R, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on June 20, 2019. \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he could not admit or deny the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 3.a, because he had not seen the medical \nreports on which the allegations were based. I have treated his answer to these \nallegations as denials. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.b, 3.b, and 3.d. He \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.c. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old logistics management specialist employed by a \ndefense contractor since March 2006. He married in 2015, after cohabitating since \n2012. He divorced in 2016. He has a six-year-old child, and he shares custody of the \nchild with his ex-wife. He currently lives with his fianc\u00e9e, who has two children, ages 8 \nand 10. He received a security clearance in August 2009. \n \n \nIn 1997, while Applicant was in high school, he and some friends were at a party, \nand they were mixing liquid drain cleaner with aluminum foil in two-liter plastic bottles. \nThe chemical reaction made the bottles explode. Someone was alarmed by the loud \nnoise and called the police, and Applicant and five others were taken into custody. \nApplicant\u2019s five companions were released to their parents. Because his father was \ntraveling and his mother did not want to drive at night on the highway, Applicant spent \nthe night in juvenile detention. (Tr. 83-84.) \n \n \nApplicant attended college from 1997 to 2001 but did not graduate. He testified \nthat he was very sheltered at home, to the extent that he did not know how to do \nlaundry or balance a checkbook. (Tr. 129.) Around 2000, he began consuming alcohol \ninfrequently, but he quickly increased his consumption to the point of frequent \nintoxication, regularly consuming 7-9 beers at a sitting. (Tr. 84.) \n \n \nOn September 22, 2001, Applicant had been drinking with friends, and he was \nheavily intoxicated. A friend dropped Applicant off at his apartment. While walking to the \napartment, Applicant flicked a lighted cigarette into the bed of a pickup truck parked in a \ncarport and started a fire. The fire spread to the carport and four adjoining residences. \nThe truck and all four residences were destroyed. (GX 9 at 1-2; Tr. 85.) \n \n\n \n \nOn October 10, 2001, after another night of heavy drinking with friends, Applicant \nflicked a cigarette onto the carpet in a hallway of his apartment building and ignited a \nsmall fire that he quickly extinguished. About a week later, he poured hair spray from a \npump bottle into a beer can and ignited it. He stumbled and ignited a fire in the hallway. \nHe was unable to extinguish the fire, and the fire department was summoned. A day \nlater, he dropped a lighted match onto a bed comforter and ignited it. (GX 9 at 2; tr. 85-\n86.)  \n3 \n \n \nIn November 2001, Applicant\u2019s father, who was on active duty at the time, \narranged to have him evaluated by a psychologist in the Navy Addictions Rehabilitation \nDepartment. Applicant told the psychologist that he had been diagnosed with attention \ndeficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a child and treated with medication. He also \ntold the psychologist that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2000 and was \nprescribed medication, but that he stopped taking the medication because he could not \ndrink alcohol while on the medication. He told the psychologist that he had difficulty \ncontrolling anger because of his bipolar disorder. The psychologist did not believe that \nApplicant was open and forthcoming during their interview. He commented that \nApplicant appeared to be seeking help in order to present himself in a positive light in \ncourt. The Navy psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol abuse but did not diagnose \nhim with bipolar disorder. (GX 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that he was never \ndiagnosed as bipolar, but he assumed that he was bipolar, because he was given a \nprescription for a drug used to treat bipolar disorder while he was in college. (Tr. 104-\n05, 110.)  \n \nAfter the November 2001 evaluation, Applicant completed a two-week alcohol-\nawareness program, followed by a third week of intensive treatment. (Tr. 89-90.) The \nNavy psychologist recommended that he abstain from alcohol. Applicant testified that \nhe complied with the recommendation. (Tr. 111.) The record does not reflect when he \nresumed drinking or his level of consumption.  He now limits his consumption to one or \ntwo drinks when he and his fianc\u00e9e have a dinner \u201cdate\u201d twice a month. (Tr. 123.) In his \n2014 SCA, he was asked, \u201cHave you EVER received counseling or treatment as a \nresult of your use of alcohol in addition to what you have already listed on this form?\u201d \nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d and did not disclose his treatment in the Navy program. (GX 1 at 35.) \n \nIn September 2002, Applicant was tried for the four fire-related events. He \npleaded guilty to two felony counts of risking a catastrophe, two misdemeanor counts of \nreckless endangerment, and two misdemeanor counts of criminal mischief. Two felony \ncounts of arson were nolle prosequi in accordance with a plea agreement. In October \n2002, he was sentenced to jail for four consecutive sentences of 3-6 months (totaling 12 \nto 24 months) for the two counts of risking a catastrophe and two counts of reckless \nendangerment, and he was sentenced to probation for the two counts of criminal \nmischief. He was in jail until October 2003. (GX 1 at 32-33; GX 7.) \n \nWhile Applicant was awaiting trial, he was employed as a cook in a local tavern. \nThe tavern owner\u2019s son accused Applicant of damaging a restroom. When the owner\u2019s \nson kept questioning Applicant and \u201cgot in his face,\u201d Applicant pushed him away, and an \n\n \n4 \n \naltercation ensued. Applicant had not been drinking because he was at work. Applicant \nwas \u201casked to leave,\u201d but two days later he was rehired. (Tr. 87-88.) No criminal \ncharges were filed. \n \nIn June 2003, while in jail, Applicant completed an alcohol and drug educational \nseminar and a 30-hour wellness-education program presented by the state department \nof corrections. (AX B; AX C.) In May 2011, he received an associate\u2019s degree in \nbusiness management. In November 2012, he was on the dean\u2019s list for the winter term, \nand he was inducted into a national technical honor society. In December 2013, he \nreceived an associate\u2019s degree in information security technology. (AX D-H.) \n \nApplicant started seeking psychotherapy around 2011-2012, after he learned that \nhis ex-wife was pregnant by her ex-husband. (Tr. 97.) He started having panic attacks, \nand his psychotherapist prescribed an anti-anxiety medication. (Tr. 93.) He did not \ndisclose his treatment for anxiety in his 2014 SCA, apparently because it was related to \nhis marital problems. (GX 1 at 29.) \n \nIn May 2014, Applicant was involved in an altercation with a fellow worker that \nwas triggered when his fellow worker played a practical joke by disconnecting all the \ncables from Applicant\u2019s computer. Applicant was convicted of assault and battery. He \nwas fined, placed on administrative leave, and was permanently barred from entering \nthe military installation where he had been working. The permanent bar was later \nreduced to six months. (Tr. 108-09; GX 2; GX 3 at 20. In August 2014, he completed a \n12-week psycho-educational program in anger management. (AX A.) \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist at \nthe request of the DOD CAF. The psychologist commented that Applicant was not \ntruthful and forthcoming during the evaluation. She noted that he denied ever having \nsymptoms of ADHD, and that he did not disclose his treatment for anxiety in his SCA. \nShe administered a personality assessment inventory but found that the results were \nnot interpretable because the validity scales indicated that he was presenting himself in \nan unrealistically favorable light. She reported that Applicant admitted starting only one \nfire and claimed that he was present at the other fires but did not start them. She \nreviewed his medical records, which reflected that a psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant \nwith bipolar disorder in 2000. She also commented that Applicant\u2019s medical records \nreflect that he frequently admitted that he was diagnosed as bipolar. She stated her \nability to make a definitive diagnosis was limited, because Applicant appeared to have \nwithheld information about his mental health history. She concluded that Applicant \u201chas \nmental, emotional, or personality conditions that could impair judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Her diagnosis was (1) alcohol use disorder, remission status unknown; \n(2) bipolar disorder, most recent episode depressed; and (3) anxiety disorder, \nunspecified. (GX 4.) \n \nA long-time friend and former co-worker describes Applicant as sincere, kind-\nhearted, trustworthy, and hardworking. She describes him as a \u201cdoting father and caring \nfriend.\u201d (AX J.) A deputy sheriff and former classmate considers Applicant trustworthy, \n\n \ncommitted, and hardworking. (AX K.) A friend who has known him for more than 25 \nyears considers him trustworthy, dedicated, hardworking, compassionate, and a \nwonderful father. (AX L.) A friend who has known him for more than 30 years considers \nhim caring, determined, and hardworking. (AX M.) Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e knows him as an \nhonest and hardworking person and a loving father for his daughter as well as her two \nchildren. (AX N.)  \n5 \n \n \nA psychologist, who has known Applicant for about nine years, submitted a letter \nattesting to his positive attitude and integrity through difficult times and his honesty and \nloyalty to family and country. The psychologist\u2019s relationship with Applicant has been \none of friendship rather than professional. (AX O.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, a retired U.S. Navy officer, is a co-owner and vice-president of \nthe company for whom Applicant works. He submitted a statement describing \nApplicant\u2019s discovery that his daughter was molested by her half-brother, his \nsubsequent divorce, and the contentious custody battle that followed the divorce. He \nstates that Applicant was diagnosed as a child with ADHD without hyperactivity. He \nstates that Applicant has never been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder or alcohol \ndependence. He describes Applicant as a loving father, and he describes Applicant\u2019s \nfianc\u00e9e as a \u201cwonderful woman.\u201d (AX P.) \n \nIn November 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a qualified medical health \nprofessional and was administered a substance-abuse subtle-screening inventory \n(SASSI-4) and determined to have a low probability of a substance-abuse disorder. The \nSASSI reflected a \u201cmoderate clinical issue with defensiveness,\u201d but the clinician who \nadministered the SASSI did not observe any remarkable defensiveness during the \nadministration of the SASSI or the biopsychosocial assessment. The evaluator did not \nrecommend substance-abuse treatment. (AX Q.) \n \nApplicant received psychotherapy from three medical professionals between \nNovember 2017 and March 2019. He saw the first therapist 15 times and was \ndiagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \nand adjustment disorder with anxiety. He was transferred to another therapist after the \nfirst therapist starting seeing his daughter, who had accused her half-brother of sexually \nmolesting her.  \n \nStarting in August 2018, the second therapist saw him six times and diagnosed \nhim with generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and major depressive disorder, recurrent \nand moderate. This therapist attributed his PTSD in large part to trauma during his \nprevious marriage and the contentious divorce that followed. He is now considered \nemotionally stable, but occasionally is affected by stress and depression, mostly when \nhe and his ex-wife have conflicts in their co-parenting. He continues to receive \npsychotherapy for anger management. He is in the clinical range for anxiety and PTSD, \nbut his aggressive tendencies and anger are in the non-clinical range. He has no \nindication of an alcohol-abuse disorder and is not bipolar. This therapist concludes by \nstating that Applicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent mental health assessments, observations, mental health \n\n \ntreatment, and his personal commitment to change via training place [him] in a \nfavorable light.\u201d She continues to treat Applicant and sees him every two or three weeks \nfor about an hour. (Tr. 19-20.) She has never seen symptoms of a bipolar disorder. She \ngives him a \u201cgood\u201d prognosis. (Tr. 20-23.) \n6 \n \n \nA third therapist evaluated Applicant in December 2018. He diagnosed Applicant \nwith adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, which was \nconsidered an improvement from the two previous evaluations. (AX R.) \n \nApplicant testified that he takes an anti-anxiety medication every morning. \nAlthough his prescription allows him to take the medication \u201cas needed,\u201d he has not \nneeded to take a second dose during the day. If he feels a sense of conflict, he has \nlearned to walk away, talk to himself, and ask himself how he should handle it. He no \nlonger needs to \u201charbor everything inside anymore.\u201d Instead, he talks to one of his close \nfriends. (Tr. 93-94.) \n \nThe co-owner of the company by whom Applicant is employed has known him \nsince he was first employed in 2006. She owns 51% of the company and Applicant\u2019s \nfather owns 49%. She is aware of the Applicant\u2019s incarceration in 2002 and his \naltercation with a fellow employee in 2014. She believes that the co-worker, a known \ntrouble-maker who is no longer employed by the company, was partly to blame for the \n2014 incident. She believes that Applicant has matured since he was first hired. She \nconsiders him emotionally stable, honest, reliable, and trustworthy. She has seen no \nsigns of alcohol abuse. (Tr. 39-45.)  \n \nA close friend of Applicant, who served on active duty in the Navy with \nApplicant\u2019s father, has known Applicant since 2000. She visited Applicant when he was \nincarcerated. For the past three years, they have had monthly job-related contact and \npersonal contact about every other month. She considers Applicant honest, reliable, \nand hardworking. She believes he has good judgment. She has never observed any \nemotional instability or excessive alcohol consumption. She believes Applicant was \nremorseful about his mistakes and has worked hard to turn his life around. She testified \nshe would hire him \u201cin a minute without hesitation. (Tr. 50-56,) \n \nA co-worker, who is a retired master chief petty officer, has had daily personal \nand professional contact with Applicant since September 2018. They have become \nclose friends. They have discussed Applicant\u2019s past conduct, including the arson \nincidents in 2002, the altercation in 2014, and his current mental health treatment. The \nco-worker testified that he considers Applicant\u2019s reliability \u201cabove reproach,\u201d and he has \ncomplete trust in his judgment. He has no doubts about Applicant\u2019s emotional stability. \n(Tr. 62-72.)  \n \nApplicant has held a second job as a contractor, on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, for \nabout four years for a company that owns four radio stations. His supervisor has \nprofessional contact with him \u201cevery month at least\u201d and social contact every month or \ntwo. His supervisor browsed the SOR but did not read it carefully. He has never seen \n\n \nApplicant intoxicated. He considers Applicant mature, trustworthy, reliable, \u201chonest to a \nfault,\u201d and a person with good judgment. He testified that Applicant had \u201csome issues\u201d \nduring his divorce proceedings, but he is usually \u201cvery even-keeled.\u201d (Tr. 73-81.) \n7 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n8 \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that, in January 2018, Applicant was evaluated and diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also \nalleges that, in around 2001, Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse and bipolar \ndisorder (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Both allegations are established by the evidence submitted at the \nhearing. \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not \nrequired for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. . . .  \n \n \nI have considered the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other \nguideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality \ncondition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, \nsuicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a \ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure \nto take prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling \nsessions. \n \nAG \u00b6 28(a) is not applicable because it applies only to behavior \u201cnot covered \nunder any other guideline.\u201d Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct was not alleged under \nGuideline J, but it was alleged under Guideline E and is addressed below under that \nguideline. AG \u00b6 28(b) is established by the multiple mental-health evaluations reflected \nin the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing. AG \u00b6 28(d) is established for \nApplicant\u2019s discontinuance of his medication for bipolar disorder, and his decision to \nresume alcohol consumption after being advised in 2001 to abstain from alcohol. This \ndisqualifying condition is not established for Applicant\u2019s mental-health issues after they \nwere identified in 2011 and thereafter, because the evidence indicates that Applicant \ncomplied with all treatment recommendations.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \n \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or \ntreatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional; \n \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, \nthe situation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) are established by the testimony and documentary \nevidence provided by Applicant\u2019s current therapists. AG \u00b6 29(c) is not \nestablished, because the health professional employed by the U.S. Government \nprovided an unfavorable diagnosis. This unfavorable diagnosis is not overcome \nby the generally favorable testimony of Applicant\u2019s therapists. His therapists \nattribute his ongoing PTSD and depression to emotional trauma during his \n\n \n10 \n \nprevious marriage and continuing conflicts with his ex-wife about co-parenting \nissues. \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor with the U.S. Government psychologist raises a \nquestion whether he has been candid with his own therapists. Furthermore, to \nthe extent that there is doubt about the low probability of recurrence, the doubt \nmust be resolved in favor of national security. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n29(d) and 29(e) are not established, because Applicant continues to deal with \nPTSD, anxiety, depression, and anger management. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the diagnoses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). It also alleges that Applicant had been consuming alcohol at the time of the \ncriminal incidents alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.b (SOR \u00b6 2.b). These allegations are supported by \nthe evidence submitted at the hearing. He admitted SOR \u00b6 2.b in his answer to the \nSOR. \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or \njeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \n\n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. Applicant was heavily intoxicated when \nthe various fire-related incidents occurred in September 2001. \n11 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(b) is not established. Applicant was at work but had not been drinking \nwhen the 2001 altercation in the tavern occurred. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d) is established. Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder \nby the Navy psychologist in 2001 and during the DOD CAF mental status evaluation in \nFebruary 2018. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and 22(f) are established by the Navy psychologist\u2019s \nrecommendation in 2001 that Applicant abstain from consuming alcohol. The \npsychologist who conducted DOD CAF evaluation diagnosed Applicant with an \u201calcohol \nuse disorder, remission status unknown,\u201d but she made no treatment recommendations. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident was in October \n2001, and there is no evidence of recurrence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) are established. Applicant acknowledged his excessive \ndrinking in college and completed the Navy rehabilitation program. He followed the \ntreatment recommendation for abstinence for a time. The record does not reflect when \nhe resumed his consumption of alcohol, but it does reflect that he is now an occasional \nand moderate drinker. The DOD CAF evaluation includes a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, \nbut the only evidence in the record suggesting that Applicant is alcohol dependent is the \nNavy psychologist\u2019s recommendation in November 2001 that he abstain from alcohol. \nHis conduct since November 2001 does not reflect alcohol dependence. \n \n\n \n12 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2 under this guideline (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and \n3.b). It SOR further alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment in 2002 for \nengaging in an altercation with another employee and for destruction of property (SOR \n\u00b6 3.c). Finally, the SOR alleges that in May 2014, Applicant was charged with simple \nassault and battery following a physical altercation with a co-worker, that he pleaded \nguilty, that he was ordered to pay a fine, and that he was removed from working on a \ncontract and barred from the military base on which he had been working (SOR \u00b6 3.d). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \n\n \n13 \n \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) \nany disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern \nof dishonesty or rule violations . . . . ; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \n \nThe February 2018 evaluation by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed the U.S. Government included a conclusion that Applicant withheld \ninformation, provided false information, and intentionally invalidated the personality \nassessment inventory. This evidence ordinarily would raise the concerns in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15(a), 15(b), and 16(a), but Applicant\u2019s lack of candor with the Government psychologist \nwas not alleged in the SOR and may not be an independent basis for denying a \nclearance. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an \napplicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; \nto evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-\nperson analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s lack of candor with the Government psychologist for these \nlimited purposes.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct in 2001 and 2014 raises the concerns in AG 16(c), \n16(d), and 16(e). The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \n\n \n14 \n \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are established for the three fire-related incidents in \nSeptember-October 2001. These incidents cased serious property damage and, \nendangered others. They resulted in felony convictions and a year in jail. However, they \noccurred 18 years ago. They were the product of Applicant\u2019s heavy alcoholic \nintoxication, and he has significantly modified his alcohol consumption since his release \nfrom jail.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are established for Applicant\u2019s barroom affray in 2002, \nwhich was minor and mitigated by the passage of time without recurrence. They also \nare established for the altercation with a co-worker in 2014, which occurred more than \nfive years ago, was instigated in large part by the coworker, and has not recurred. \nApplicant is now working in a supportive environment for a company co-owned by his \nfather and a close friend, and he is surrounded by friendly and supportive co-workers, \nmaking further workplace violence unlikely. AG \u00b6 17(e) is established by Applicant\u2019s full \ndisclosure of his criminal conduct.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I, G, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines I, G, and E, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \n\n \nsecurity concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and personal conduct, but he has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his psychological conditions. \n15 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 56-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him in 2006. He is employed as a supply technician for a company doing business in the defense industry. His place of employment is a military proving ground. He has been so employed since 2005. He has a high-school education. He has married twice. He married the first time in 1982 and divorced in 2012. He married the second time in 2014. He has two minor stepchildren residing in his household via his current marriage. The SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of the following: (1) a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy case with his first wife ending in a discharge in 2005; (2) failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2014 as well as timely pay taxes for those tax years; and (3) 24 delinquent accounts ranging in amounts from $52 to $5,213 for a total of approximately $18,700.2 The 24 delinquent accounts include 7 medical collection accounts for approximately $3,099. At the hearing, Department Counsel conceded they had no evidence to establish the medical collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i.3 In addition, Department Counsel noted that accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.o are duplicates.

He did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his \nlong-standing history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against \nApplicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non November 19, 2015.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on July 21, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 5, 2017. His answers were mixed \nwith admissions and denials along with brief explanations. He also requested an in-\nperson hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 13, 2017. The hearing scheduled for \nJanuary 23, 2018, was postponed due to a government shutdown. The hearing took \nplace as rescheduled on April 19, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Both \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted. \nApplicant and his spouse were called as witnesses.   \n  \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \npreviously granted to him in 2006. He is employed as a supply technician for a company \ndoing business in the defense industry. His place of employment is a military proving \nground. He has been so employed since 2005. He has a high-school education. He has \nmarried twice. He married the first time in 1982 and divorced in 2012. He married the \nsecond time in 2014. He has two minor stepchildren residing in his household via his \ncurrent marriage.  \n  \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of the following: (1) \na joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy case with his first wife ending in a discharge in 2005; (2) \nfailure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2014 \nas well as timely pay taxes for those tax years; and (3) 24 delinquent accounts ranging \nin amounts from $52 to $5,213 for a total of approximately $18,700.2 The 24 delinquent \naccounts include 7 medical collection accounts for approximately $3,099. At the \nhearing, Department Counsel conceded they had no evidence to establish the medical \ncollection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i.3 In addition, Department Counsel noted that \naccounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.o are duplicates. Otherwise, the SOR allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence. \n \nOverall, Applicant attributed his history of financial problems to the circumstances \nof his first marriage, which included his ignorance of household finances and reliance on \nhis spouse to handle all financial matters.4 That situation was further aggravated by his \n                                                          \n2 Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s financial history includes a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case \nfiled in 1992 and dismissed in 1995 during his first marriage. Exhibit 2. Applicant had only a vague \nrecollection of the case. Tr. 56. Given the age of the bankruptcy case along with the few details known \nabout the case, I have given the matter little weight.   \n \n3 Tr. 14-18.  \n \n4 Tr. 38-44.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwife\u2019s gambling problem, which was also unknown to him until about the last six months \nof the marriage.  \n \nApplicant was also unaware that his first wife was failing to timely file tax returns \nand pay taxes due to the federal and state tax authorities. He disclosed the tax matters \nin his November 2015 security clearance application.5 Applicant and his current spouse \nexplained at the hearing that they believe they are now current and in good standing \nwith their state income tax obligations, although they had no supporting documentation \nfrom the state tax authority. A review of Applicant\u2019s IRS account transcripts (obtained in \nAugust 2017) show that the returns were untimely filed and penalties for filing the tax \nreturns after the due date and for late payment of tax were assessed against him.6 The \ntranscripts also establish that he owes $2,815 for tax year 2010, $6,548 for 2011, \n$5,485 for 2012, $2,549 for 2013, and $371 for 2014, for a total amount of \napproximately $17,768 in back taxes, penalties, and interest. The transcripts further \nestablish Applicant arranged for several installment agreements, the most recent of \nwhich was established in November 2016. At the hearing, Applicant and his wife \nexplained that they are current in making $200 monthly payments per the installment \nagreement with the IRS. They also estimated the current balance at approximately \n$22,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS.7  \n \nApplicant has used the services of a law firm specializing in disputing information \non credit reports, initially after his divorce and then more recently. He presented \ndocumentation showing some progress in removal of several disputed debts.8 He also \npresented his divorce decree showing that his first wife was awarded the automobile \nthat is the subject of the $5,213 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.c.9 He further \npresented documentation related to the landlord-tenant dispute that is the subject of the \n$3,805 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.d.10  \n \nDissatisfied with the services of the credit-repair law firm, Applicant and his \nspouse are retaining a bankruptcy attorney to assist with the tax problems as well as to \nestablish a court-approved payment plan through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.11 At \nthe hearing they explained they had paid about half of the retainer fee and anticipated \npaying the fee in full in June 2018. They understand the firm\u2019s services will include a \nreview of several years\u2019 worth of tax returns, addressing the back taxes, and \nrepresentation in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.  \n                                                          \n5 Exhibit 1. \n \n6 Exhibit 1. \n \n7 Tr. 59-60, 79.  \n \n8 Exhibits E, H, J, K, O, V, and X. \n \n9 Exhibit C.  \n \n10 Exhibit D.  \n \n11 Tr. 44-49, 80-81.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant is now involved with the household finances. His spouse is in charge, \nbut he has an active role and is no longer ignorant and in the dark. His spouse is \nmanaging their finances carefully with the aid of a spreadsheet and what she calls her \n\u201clittle green book.\u201d12 Applicant is paid hourly and earns about $38,000 annually.13 His \nspouse is employed as a case manager for a local health-care facility; she is paid hourly \nand earns about $38,000. In additional, she receives $350 monthly in monthly child-\nsupport payments, although the payments are irregular.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.14 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d15 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.16 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.17 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.18 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.19 \n                                                          \n12 Tr. 81-81.  \n \n13 Tr. 54.  \n \n14 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n15 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n16 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n17 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n18 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n19 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.20 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.21 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.22 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.23 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .24 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n \n                                                          \n20 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n21 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n22 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n23 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n24 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute of provides \nevidence of actions taken to resolve the issue; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nConcerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant is in a difficult \nsituation, and I certainly have empathy for anyone who relies on a spouse to their \ndetriment. With that said, Applicant was divorced in 2012 and remarried in 2014, and \nyet the financial hangover from his first marriage continues several years later in 2018. \nApplicant did not exercise reasonable diligence in addressing his financial problems \nstemming from his first marriage. He has now wisely retained the services of a \nbankruptcy attorney. When the record closed, he was still paying the retainer fee and \nwork had not started on the case. Even if I assume the Chapter 13 case was filed in \nJune or July 2018 and the bankruptcy court approved a payment plan some months \nthereafter, Applicant would now be in the first 12 months of the plan. In my view, it is too \nsoon to tell if Applicant will follow through with the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case and then \nadhere to the plan\u2019s schedule of monthly payments, which are typically over 36 to 60 \nmonths. Although I have credited Applicant for circumstances largely beyond his control \n(the marital difficulties in particular) and he has made progress in fixing his tax problem, \nthe evidence is not sufficient to fully mitigate the security concern stemming from his \nlong-standing history of financial problems.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j -- 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p -- 1.z:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.
