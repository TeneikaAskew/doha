Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on October 3, 2016. \nOn February 12, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \nalleging \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on February 28, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nApril 26, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on August 3, 2018. On February 26, \n\n2 \n \n2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for April 3, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D were admitted without \nobjection. I left the record open until April 17, 2019, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX E through H, which I have \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old lab manager currently employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2010. He has worked as a defense contractor and held a security clearance \nsince 1996. He has worked as a first responder since 1998 and is now a sergeant in the \ncounty rescue squad. He has been awarded numerous commendations for his volunteer \nservice, including two citations from the state General assembly. (AX G.) Applicant and \nhis wife married in 1995. (GX 1.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges eight past-due accounts totaling $29,492. \nApplicant admits seven of the accounts and denies the $1,243 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nThe delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from April \n2018, December 2017, and February 2017. (GX 2; GX 3; GX 4.)  \n \nApplicant and his wife historically struggled financially due to low-paying jobs. \nApplicant worked for his previous employer from 1996 until 2010. He started as an hourly \nemployee earning $5.90 per hour. By 2010, Applicant had worked his way up to the \nposition of lab manager where he earned $27 per hour, grossing approximately $56,000 \nannually. Applicant\u2019s wife previously worked for the same employer, at a lower hourly \nrate, until she was laid off in 2010. She was unemployed for approximately six months, \nuntil beginning part-time work for the contractor who employs Applicant. This period of \nunemployment and underemployment created financial strains for Applicant\u2019s household \nprompting Applicant to sell his vehicle to help make ends meet. (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant\u2019s \nwife has since gained full-time employment. Applicant and his wife earn a combined gross \nsalary of approximately $130,000, of which Applicant earns approximately $86,000. (Tr. \n38-40; Tr. 42-43.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent financial issues arose from unanticipated financial \ndemands. Applicant\u2019s mother, who lived in Florida, died in 2014. The obligation of \nwrapping up his mother\u2019s affairs fell to Applicant. He had to make multiple trips to Florida, \nand incurred travel-related expenses. Because he was frequently away from home, \nApplicant\u2019s wife took over the responsibility of managing the household finances. She \nwas inexperienced at handling the accounting and was delinquent in paying several \naccounts. (Tr. 21.) \n \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s death, his father became overwhelmed. Applicant \nprovided financial as well as emotional support to his father. Within months of his mother\u2019s \ndeath, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was stricken with cancer. She was no longer able to \n\n3 \n \nperform her job. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s income was unreliable. Applicant and his wife \nprovided financial support for her mother. (Tr. 22-23.) Applicant and his wife are no longer \nfinancially supporting any family members. (Tr. 56-58; Tr. 70-72.) \n \nApplicant and his wife incurred significant medical expenses between 2008 and \n2009. During this period, it was also discovered that Applicant\u2019s wife had cancer that \nsubsequently required extensive surgery and treatments. They primarily used a dedicated \ncredit card to pay the medical expenses. (Tr. 44-46.) The account first became delinquent \nin 2013 and has since been charged off in the amount of $11,065. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant \nalso took two personal loans through this same creditor which have since been charged \noff in the amounts of $2,091 and $1,901 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. Since 2016, \nApplicant made sporadic payments to this creditor, usually in increments of $50. Applicant \nentered a repayment agreement with this creditor in March 2019 which addresses the \nthree delinquent accounts. The creditor automatically withdraws $250 a month from \nApplicant\u2019s checking account. (Tr. 45-46; AX C; AX D.) These debts are being resolved.  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant returned to college. In order to finance his tuition and other \nexpenses, Applicant took out several student loans. These loans became delinquent and \nApplicant was past-due $304 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $386 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $153 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The \ncreditor consolidated loans and Applicant has made sporadic payments since 2014 and \nincreasingly since 2016. His current balance is approximately $36,000. Applicant has \nbeen in discussions with the creditor in an effort to negotiate a monthly payment that is \nfinancially manageable for Applicant. The creditor is currently requiring a $2,000 lump-\nsum payment, which will be followed by monthly payments of $226. In the interim, \nApplicant has continued making payments whenever he is able. (Tr. 26-28.) These debts \nare being resolved. \n \nThe $3,362 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was for a credit account with a computer \ncompany where Applicant purchased a computer in about 2015. Applicant did not realize \nthat this account was delinquent. The original creditor sold the account to a collection \nagency that Applicant did not recognize as one of his creditors. However, he made a $50 \npayment to a collection agency. (AX C.) In March 2019, Applicant entered a repayment \nagreement with the monthly payment of $44 that is debited directly from Applicant\u2019s \nchecking account by the creditor. (AX A.) This debt is being resolved. \n \nApplicant denies the $1,243 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. The debt was owed for \ntuition for a college course that Applicant dropped. The debt was resolved in 2014 when \nthe state withheld Applicant\u2019s tax refund. The debt has not appeared on Applicant\u2019s CBRs \nsince February 2017. (GX 4.) This debt is resolved. \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased the land on which their house stands in 1996 and \nbuilt their house in 2006. Their mortgage-loan payment is $1,244 a month and is current. \nTheir second mortgage-loan payment is $942 month, which is also current. Applicant \nrecently made his final $810 payment for his vehicle and now has title. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ncar is paid off. Applicant lives within his means, to include the expenses for two dogs with \nchronic health issues. Applicant\u2019s second mortgage loan will be paid off in 2021 and his \n\n4 \n \nprimary mortgage loan will be paid off in 2025. Applicant purchased a recreational vehicle \nfor $18,000 in approximately 2016 using a 401(k) loan. He is current with his loan \npayments of $40 per pay period. Applicant has approximately $3,000 in his checking \naccount and approximately $60,000 in his 401(k). (Tr. 62; Tr. 59.) Applicant intends to \nuse the $810 a month that was previously allotted for his truck payment to make payments \non his other outstanding accounts. (Tr. 72-73.) \n \nApplicant did not understand the potential security significance of financial \ndelinquencies until his 2017 personal subject interview (PSI). Upon realizing the \nimportance of resolving any and all the delinquent accounts, Applicant contacted his \ncreditors and began making sporadic payments on his accounts when he was able. (AX \nB; Tr. 70-71.) Applicant now maintains a spreadsheet with the tickler system to alert him \nto when bills are due for payment. (Tr. 70-72; Tr. 62.)  In the event that Applicant changes \nemployers, he is eligible to cash out his unused leave which totals more than 360 hours. \nHe would use this money to pay down any remaining debts. (AX D.) Applicant has not \nincurred any recent delinquent debts. He was sincere and credible while testifying. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current direct supervisor of more than four years states that Applicant \nhas an amazing work ethic and that he is loyal, trustworthy, and an asset to the team. \nShe further states that he demonstrates integrity and that he should be granted access \nto classified information. Another of Applicant\u2019s supervisors, who frequently travels \nofficially with Applicant, states that Applicant should be granted a clearance and that he \ndemonstrates loyalty, trustworthiness, and integrity. (AX H.) Applicant received \noutstanding performance appraisals in 2017 and 2018. (AX E; AX F.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n5 \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u2026. \n\n6 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \n \nThe relevant mitigating conditions in this case are: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose due to conditions largely beyond his control. \nSpecifically, he worked at a low-paying job for 15 years, during which time his wife \nrequired expensive medical treatment and care. Applicant\u2019s wife was laid off from her job \nin 2010 and was unemployed for approximately six months then underemployed. \nApplicant acted responsibly by selling his vehicle. In 2014, Applicant\u2019s mother died and \nApplicant incurred extensive costs traveling to take care of her affairs and by providing \nhis father with financial assistance. Applicant and his wife\u2019s finances were also negatively \naffected after her mother was stricken with cancer in 2014, compelling them to provide \nfinancial assistance to her. Each time an unforeseeable financial crisis arose, Applicant \nacted responsibly. He sold his vehicle in 2010 to help cover expenses during his wife\u2019s \nunemployment and underemployment. He contacted his creditors and since 2016, has \nbeen making sporadic payments to each of his creditors whenever he was financially able \n\n7 \n \nto do so. He recently re-contacted all of the SOR creditors and entered repayment \nagreements with two of the three creditors. He is actively negotiating with the third creditor \nto enter a repayment plan for his outstanding student loans. Applicant no longer provides \nfinancial support to family members. He successfully disputed the tuition debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. Applicant currently lives within his means and has substantial savings in his \n401(k). He has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. Applicant has resolved or is \nresolving the SOR debts and it is unlikely that he will be unable to maintain his finances \nin the future. Applicant\u2019s past financial problems do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that a person make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties did not arise under circumstances that suggest \nreckless or irresponsible behavior. Although Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, he has \nmade a good-faith effort to repay or successfully dispute his debts and has established a \nplan to resolve his financial issues within his means and to avoid future financial issues. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1996. He has worked as a first \nresponder since 1998. Applicant is trusted and respected by his supervisors and received \noutstanding performance reviews in 2017 and 2018. He was sincere and credible during \nhis testimony.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n",

The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October \n9, 2018, scheduling the hearing for November 9, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits, which were marked as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A-V, and accepted into the record without objection. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I held the record open for additional documents. Applicant submitted four \n12/18/2018\n\n \n2 \n \ndocuments which were marked as AE ( W, X, Y, and Z), and admitted into the record \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 26, \n2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 52, is divorced and has one adopted adult daughter. He served in \nthe United States Army Reserves for 28 years, and was deployed overseas. Applicant \nobtained his undergraduate degree in 1989 and a master\u2019s degree in 1992. Applicant \ncompleted his security clearance application on May 16, 2016. He has held a security \nclearance. (GE 1)  He has worked for his current employer since 2016. From 2010 until \n2015, Applicant worked abroad. (Tr. 24)  He usually had four jobs to support the family. \n(Tr. 30) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent debts in the approximate \namount of $76,000. (GE 2, 3) The debts include a home equity loan, and three collection \naccounts. Applicant admitted one delinquent debt, which amounts to about $21,000. He \nprovided explanations for each allegation. \n \nApplicant acknowledged his financial hardship. He takes responsibility and is \nattempting to correct the issues. (Tr. 14) He does not want to make excuses, but wants \nto clarify the situation. During the marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife was responsible for payment \nof all bills, and he did not own a checkbook, or a credit card.  Applicant was divorced in \nOctober 2010. A marital settlement agreement, dated October 12, 2010, required the \nparties to comply with certain provisions. (AE P) A relevant provision to this case concerns \nthe marital home. Under the terms of the marital settlement agreement, the marital home \nwas to be sold as soon as possible, and the wife shall reside in the marital home until it \nis sold. Applicant was to pay the mortgage and other costs for the home until the property \nis sold or one year from date of divorce. Before the divorce, Applicant did not have any \nfinancial issues. Applicant\u2019s wife agreed to pay the home equity loan and one-half of other \nexpenses. (AE P) \n \nApplicant signed and read the marital agreement, but he explained that he read it \nquickly before he was off to Germany for work. He did not recall the provision that \nobligated him to pay the home equity loan until the house was sold and other bills related \nto the house.  (Tr. 35) He stopped paying the mortgage in 2012. He did not think about \nthe house until he returned to the states in 2015.The house was not sold, and the broker \nwould not talk to Applicant. His wife resides in the home, and she pays the mortgage. (Tr. \n42) The house was for sale at one point in time, but it was not sold.  Applicant stated that \nhis wife does not want to move and that he is enlisting legal counsel to help bring about \na sale of the home. \n \nApplicant was candid and open when he stated that he did not understand the \nmarital agreement, but he knows now that he should have been more aware. He \napologizes for the mistake. He was not aware of a duty to pay  the home equity loan, and \nhe really does not know why. However, as soon as he learned about the financial issues \nwith the SOR, he agreed immediately to pay whatever was necessary to rectify the \n\n \n3 \n \nsituation. He is working two jobs and is making payments on the home equity loan and \nthe collection account. He is using legal means to enforce the sale of the home. Applicant \nand his ex-wife will use proceeds of the first mortgage to pay whatever debts remain on \nthe home equity loan. \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a., Applicant denied this allegation for a home equity loan in the \namount of $47,000, because as part of the marital agreement his wife was to pay the \nhome equity line of credit. He was abroad from 2010 until 2015, and he never was on \nnotice. He contacted the creditor and he was told that he is not the primary borrower on \nthe account and he received no information.  His wife still resides in the marital home. He \nnever knew that he was responsible for the home equity loan if the house was not sold. \nHe agreed to begin making payments on the home equity loan in the amount of $207 until \nthe house is sold. He submitted evidence that he is making payments and is current on \nthe equity loan. (Tr. 44; AE A, B, C, D, W) Applicant had sent his wife various amounts of \nmoney to help her pay the mortgage while he was in Germany. \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b, a charged-off credit account in the amount of $5,304, Applicant \ndenied the account as it was an account that he was not aware of. His ex-wife was to \nhave made payments. However, he negotiated a settlement payment. He had already \nmade several monthly payments before the settlement. (AE H, I) The settlement amount \nwas $2,025. (AE L) He had not been aware of the account before he received the SOR. \nIn fact, he did not have access to the credit card. However, he had agreed to make \npayments of $337.50. (AE H, I, J, W) He is current with the payments.  \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.c, a collection account in the amount of $21,472, Applicant made \npayments on this account until 2015. He never had access to the credit card. Since \nlearning about the account, he is making payments of $120 monthly. (AE K, L, M and W) \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant denied the debt because it has been paid in full. (AE \nN) It was for electric service while he worked in Germany. He presented documentation \nthat the bill is paid. SOR \u00b61.e is a duplicate of 1.d. (AE O) \n \nApplicant paid non-SOR debts that were joint accounts.  (Tr. 57) He also took a \nloan from his thrift savings plan (TSP) to pay other joint accounts.  Applicant \nacknowledged that he has made some mistakes. He and his ex-wife have agreed that \nproceeds from the purchase of the marital home will go toward the home equity loan. (AE \nG) \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $94,000. He submitted a financial statement. \n(AE V) Applicant is also working a second job on the weekends at an hourly rate of \n$19.95. He has a net monthly remainder of about $450. Applicant has no current \ndelinquent debts. Applicant also has a Veteran\u2019s monthly disability payment. He works \nwith a budget and has made several changes to his life style to cut expenses. (Tr. 96) His \ncredit report does not reflect any collection accounts. (AE Q) \n \n \n  \n\n \n4 \n \nCharacter References \n \nApplicant submitted awards, training certificates, and recognitions that he has \nreceived during his career. He also presented evaluations that reflect successful ratings.  \n(AE R, S, T, U, V) Each character letter attests to his good judgment and professionalism \nboth in the military and civilian world. Applicant performs at a high standard and has \nalways followed protocol. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \n\n \n5 \n \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are the result of circumstances beyond his control. Due to his \ndivorce and the ensuing marital agreement, Applicant had to pay certain amounts under \nthe marital agreement. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant is unlikely to put \nhimself in a similar situation. He is applauded for his good judgement in his career. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. While Applicant was abroad, he sent money to his wife \nfor the mortgage and he continued to send money after the first year. The house did not \nsell, and he had little control over that as he was working abroad. He acknowledges that \nhe did not understand, but should have, that he was responsible for continuing payments \non the home equity loan. He believed his wife was responsible for that, and he had no \nnotice that he owed any money. He was sincere and credible in his testimony. As soon \nas it became clear to him that the situation required him to pay the home equity loan and \ncollection accounts, he immediately addressed the issues. He has set up plans and has \npaid two debts, and settled one. He provided sufficient information that under the \ncircumstances he acted in good-faith and was responsible. He candidly admitted that he \nmade a mistake. He now has a track record of responsible payments.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) are partially established. Applicant did not receive any \nformal financial counseling. He is making payments on the home equity loan and has \naddressed the other debts. He is back in the United States and will take any legal action \nnecessary to have the marital home sold. The proceeds will pay the mortgages. He has \nno delinquent debts at this time. He is current on his daily expenses. He is adjusting his \nlife style to save money. He has a good job. In fact, he is working two jobs to pay bills. \n \nApplicant met his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the SOR. For \nthese reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. for Applicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F  and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his credibility and openness at the hearing, and his many \nyears of military service, I conclude that Applicant presented sufficient information to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

As of the date of the hearing, she was attending college and expected to receive her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2022. She worked for a previous employer, a DOD contractor, from 2015 to 2016. She has worked for her current employer, a DOD contractor, since July 2016. She became a team lead medical appointment coordinator in August 2017. She was unsure whether she has ever had access to sensitive information.2 Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to losing her job, in which she earned $20,000 annually, in August 2009, when she was pregnant with her second child. She was subsequently unemployed three times: from August 2009 to December 2012, May 2013 to September 2014, and July to October 2015. During these periods, she only received limited state unemployment benefits twice. She was otherwise underemployed, until she obtained a job with a DOD contractor in 2015. She is also a single parent, though she receives assistance from her eldest child\u2019s father.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 10, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) \non September 17, 2018, scheduling the hearing for October 30, 2018. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. \n03/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1, 3, and 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant objected to GE 2, on the basis that it was no longer an accurate \nrepresentation of her credit profile since it was a 2016 credit bureau report. I overruled \nApplicant\u2019s objection and admitted GE 2 in evidence, noting that I would consider her \nobjection in the weight that I gave GE 2. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through G, which I admitted in evidence without objection. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I kept the record open until November 13, 2018, for additional evidence. By \nthat date, Applicant submitted additional documentation, which I marked collectively as \nAE H and admitted in evidence without objection.

She is also a single parent, \nthough she receives assistance from her eldest child\u2019s father. She attributed her \ndelinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a to her stolen identity, discussed further below.3 \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent consumer debts totaling $22,551 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.d, 1.h.-1.j), two delinquent student loans totaling $6,215 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f), and a \n$22 delinquent state overpayment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g). The debts are established by the \n2016 credit bureau report. The 2017 credit bureau report only reported the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. Applicant also disclosed and discussed her debts in her 2016 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) and 2017 background interview.4  \n \n                                                     \n1 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 32, 48-49, 59; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 5, 7-9, 41, 57; GE 1, 3; AE A, G. \n \n3 Tr. at 31-65; GE 1, 3; AE A. \n \n4 GE 1-4. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $1,247 wireless cellular account placed for collection. \nApplicant testified that her identity was stolen and used to open this account in her \nname. She testified that the same thing happened to her mother. She indicated that she \ndisputed this debt for years with the credit reporting agencies. The debt was not \nreported on her April 2018 credit report. She indicated that she has a fraud alert on her \ncredit report as a result of the identity theft incident.5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $472 wireless cellular account placed for collection.

Applicant co-\nsigned this account for an ex-boyfriend. Applicant provided documentation reflecting \nthat she paid this debt in November 2017.7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a $6,756 balance due for a voluntary car repossession, and \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is for a $13,423 collection account by the same creditor as SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nApplicant indicated that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h are duplicate accounts for the balance due \non the car that she voluntarily surrendered in August 2010, after she had lost her job \nand gave birth to her second child. She testified that she contacted the underlying \ncreditor, from whom she obtained the car loan, by telephone in approximately 2017, and \nwas told that they did not have any information because they placed the account for \ncollection. She testified that she then contacted the collection agency with the intention \nof making payment arrangements, but was told that they too did not have any \ninformation because the debt was older than seven years. She indicated that she \nattempted to obtain documentation from the creditor reflecting that the debts were \nduplicates, but she did not receive a timely response.8 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are for two student loans totaling $6,215 placed for collection. \nApplicant testified that she obtained these loans when she went to school. She testified \nthat her tax refunds were intercepted and applied toward the loans, and she paid the \nremaining $100 balance in November 2016. She testified that she was able to obtain \nfinancial aid to finance her schooling as of the date of the hearing. She provided \ndocumentation reflecting that both student loans were resolved as of December 2017.9 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a $22 state unemployment overpayment placed for collection. \nApplicant provided documentation reflecting that she paid this debt in November 2017.10 \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 32, 42-44, 59; GE 2, 3; AE A, F, H. \n \n6 Tr. at 32-33; GE 3; AE A, E. \n \n7 Tr. at 32-33, 59-60; AE A, D. \n \n8 Tr. at 33-34, 44-46; GE 1, 3; AE A, F, H. \n \n9 Tr. at 34-35, 60; GE 1, 3; AE A, B. \n \n10 Tr. at 35-36; GE 3; AE A, C. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j are for two parking tickets totaling $500 placed for collection. \nApplicant testified that she paid these tickets in around 2014 or 2015, and they are no \nlonger reported on her credit report. She testified that she registered her car with the \njurisdiction\u2019s department of motor vehicles (DMV) in 2018, and she provided \ndocumentation from the DMV website reflecting that she would not have been able to \ndo so if she had any outstanding tickets.11 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has been promoted twice since she started her \ncurrent job in July 2016. She earned $47,000 annually since August 2017, but suffered \na pay cut of $800 monthly in April 2018 due to a contractor change, which has impacted \nher ability to pay her bills. As of the date of the hearing, she had fallen behind on her \nrent of $1,095 monthly, as well as her gas and electric bill. However, she testified that \nshe was in communication with her landlord; she sought energy assistance for her \nelectric bill; and she was current on her $470 monthly payments for her car she \npurchased in February 2018, as well as her cellular bill. She was also looking for part-\ntime jobs to supplement her income. Her 2018 credit report does not reflect any \ndelinquent debts. She receives budgeting advice from her mother, but she has not \notherwise received financial counseling.12 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s director of operations at her current job describe her as an excellent \ncommunicator, and an independent, organized, and detail-oriented worker. The director \nwrote that Applicant was responsible for supervising 10 medical appointment \ncoordinators in her section, and she did so efficiently and in a manner that led them to \nquickly become \u201csubject matter experts\u201d in their respective procedures and operations. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor of two years wrote that Applicant is a valuable asset, and her \ncontributions are mission-essential.13 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n                                                     \n11 Tr. at 35-36, 46-47, 60; GE 3; AE A, H. \n \n12 Tr. at 39-41, 48, 50-54, 56-59, 62-63; AE F, H. \n \n13 AE G. \n\n \n5 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under \nher circumstances. She credibly testified that she made efforts to resolve her delinquent \ndebts once she obtained stable employment in 2015, and she continued her efforts \nupon receipt of the SOR, in spite of the pay cut she received in April 2018.  \n \nApplicant provided documentation to show that she paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j are not reported on her \nrecent credit reports from 2017 and 2018, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is not reported on \nher 2018 credit report. She credibly testified that she disputed SOR \u00b6 1.a. I find that \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a duplication of SOR \u00b6 1.h, in light of Applicant\u2019s credible testimony that \nthe debt pertained to her car that she voluntarily surrendered in 2010, after she lost her \njob and gave birth to her second child. She also credibly testified that she attempted to \nresolve this debt with both the underlying creditor and the collection agency, but was \ntold that she could not do so since the debt was older than seven years. She also \ncredibly testified that she resolved the two parking tickets in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j, in light \nof her ability to successfully register her current car in 2018. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), and 20(d) apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

I was \nassigned the case on September 12, 2018.  \nA notice of hearing was issued on October 17, 2018, setting the hearing for \nDecember 6, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered \n15 exhibits (Exs.), noted as Exs. 1-15. Applicant gave testimony and introduced one \nwitness. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 13, 2018. Based on the \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\ntestimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security \nconcerns under either guideline alleged. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 71-year-old administrative assistant. She has worked on various \ngovernment contracts for over 25 years. She was first awarded a secret clearance in \n2008. Applicant was unemployed for about a month in 2007. (Tr. 25) Once earning \nabout $60,000 a year, she now only earns about $32,000 under her present contract. \nApplicant is a high school graduate who has completed some business school courses. \nShe has two middle-aged children and her spouse is deceased. At issue is \napproximately $37,000 in delinquent debts, and multiple theft-related offenses.  \n \nIn 2010 or 2011, Applicant had a gathering at her home. After it was over, she \ndiscovered her \u201cwallet and everything\u201d was stolen. (Tr. 13-14) The police would not take \na report because she had no idea who had stolen her wallet and there was no evidence \nof burglary. (Tr. 14) About three months later, she started getting calls about debts that \nwere not hers. She wrote some of the creditors to apprise them of the situation. She \nalso contacted some lending institutions with which she had bona fide debts.  \n \nIn addition, Applicant signed for both a truck and an apartment for a friend facing \nhard times. The individual lost their job and left Applicant with two additional balances. \n((SOR allegations 1.a ($17,689) and 1.b ($14,804)) Applicant learned that these debts \nwere delinquent in 2018, after her credit report was generated. (Tr. 30) In January 2018, \nApplicant spoke with both creditors and was told they would be willing to reach a \nsettlement, but no documentary evidence of such an offer or arrangement was \nintroduced. (Tr. 14, 29-30, 34) \n \nWith regard to the delinquent debts reflected in the SOR from 1.c-1.l, Applicant \nasserts they are the product of identity fraud, the result of the identity theft that occurred \nduring the above-referenced house party, although the evidence indicated the debt at \n1.f pre-dates that event. (Tr. 40-41) Given the circumstances, she denies responsibility \nfor the debts. (Tr. 15, 36-37) No formal disputes regarding these accounts have been \ndocumented. (Tr. 37-39) These debts amount to about $4,725, arranged in size from \n$57 to $1,438, and include debts for such things as cable service, telecommunications \nservice, and retail entities. \n \nThe SOR allegation at 1.m concerns a 1980 charge for four bad checks \n(misdemeanor) which led to a 60-day period of incarceration, suspended, and three \nmonths of probation. Applicant does not remember this incident and believes some of \nthese related citations may be duplicative. (Tr. 42) A November 1981 charge was \nentered for forgery (felony) and bad check (misdemeanor), leading to a sentence of 16-\n18 months of incarceration, suspended, and two years\u2019 probation. Subsequent charges \nfor bad checks were issued in 1982, 1995 (felony), and 1997, followed by a 2001 \ncharge of theft (misdemeanor) and shoplifting (misdemeanor). Overall, Applicant is \nconfused with regard to these allegations and any related specifics. (Tr. 43) Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nnoted that these related debts must have been satisfied for, had they not been honored, \nshe would have been formally incarcerated. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant, however, had no \ndocumentary evidence regarding such payment to offer. \n \nIn March 2018, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). She \ndeliberately answered \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cSection 25. Investigations and Clearance \nRecord \u2013 Government Debarment: \u2018Have you EVER been debarred from government \nemployment?\u2019\u201d In doing so, she failed to disclose she had been barred from competing \nin Office of Personnel Management (OPM) examinations or accepting appointments in \nthe competitive Federal service from April 2, 1986, to April 1, 1988. She similarly \ndeliberately answered \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cSection 26. Financial Record \u2013 \nDelinquency Involving Routine Accounts: \u2018Other than previously listed, have any of \nthe following happened? In the past seven (7) years, you had any possessions or \nproperty voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed? In the past seven (7) \nyears, you had bills or debts turned over to collection agency? In the past seven (7) \nyears, you had any account of credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed?\u2019\u201d This admitted denial was in contradiction to her answers in \nallegations 1,a, 1,d, and 1.l, above. \n \nIn addition, Applicant admitted she falsified material facts on an October 2010 \nSCA in answering \u201cno\u201d to \u201cSection 25. Investigations and Clearance Record \u2013 \nGovernment Debarment: \u2018Have you EVER had a clearance or access authorization \ndenied, suspended, or revoked; or been debarred from government employment?,\u2019\u201d \nwhen she was, in fact, barred from competing in OPM examinations or accepting \nappointments in the competitive Federal service from April 2, 1986, to April 1, 1988. \n \nOn an August 2008 SCA, in response to \u201cSection 18. Your Investigations \nRecord: \u201cTo your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access authorization \ndenied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been debarred from government \nemployment?,\u201d Applicant intentionally answered \u201cno.\u201d In doing so, she deliberately failed \nto disclose the fact she had been barred from competing in OPM examinations or \naccepting appointments in the competitive Federal service from April 2, 1986, to April 1, \n1988. \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant completed another SCA. She falsified facts in its \nexecution by answering \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cSection 22. Police Record: \u2018Have you \nEVER been charged with any felony offense?\u201d\u2019\u201d Her falsity was based on her earlier \ncharges for bad check and forgery, noted above. A similar falsity was committed by \nApplicant with regard to the same question on a SCA from October 2010. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so;  \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFive conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n                                                                                  \n \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue, none of which were shown to be \nfully resolved or addressed. Many debts were the result of stolen credit cards or \nidentification left unsecured by Applicant in her home during a party. While this has the \npotential of raising AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant failed to offer documentation reflecting that \nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances to ameliorate the situation.   \n \nAs for addressing the created delinquent debts at issue, it appears some are \nattributable to personal identity information and credit cards that were left unsecured \nduring a house party, and to a reduction in pay. Applicant, failed, however, to show she \nacted responsibly at the time. Applicant stated that she has disputed some of her debts, \nbut she provided no documentary material substantiating that claim.  \n \nThere is no documentation reflecting Applicant has or is receiving financial \ncounseling. There is no documentary evidence showing that any of her multiple bad \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nchecks have been honored, although the fact she has never been formally incarcerated \nappears to indicate some degree of resolution was reached. Lack of documented \nprogress reflecting that Applicant has resolved her delinquent debts, brought them \nunder control, or otherwise resolved them does little to give rise to any of the available \nmitigating conditions. Consequently, none of the mitigating conditions apply.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, Applicant admitted making repeated falsifications on SCAs in 2016, \n2010, and 2008. These falsifications, omissions, or obfuscations concerned past \ndelinquent debts, a two-year debarment in the 1980s, and a past felony criminal record. \nBecause these misleading answers were intentional and deliberate, the following \ndisqualifying condition applies:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nI find that the false and omitted facts, which Applicant admits were intentionally \nput forth, were done so in order to set herself in a better light. While Applicant is no \ndoubt contrite, these admitted facts show a pattern that continued from 2008 through as \nrecently as 2016. Insufficient facts were introduced indicating the security concerns \nraised by these egregious falsities to mitigate security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 71-year-old administrative assistant who has worked on various \ngovernment contracts for over 25 years. A high school graduate who has completed \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nsome college courses, she has had a secret clearance since 2008. Applicant was \nunemployed for about a month in 2007. Once earning about $60,000 a year, she now \nonly earns about $32,000 under her present contract. She is a widow with two middle-\naged children. She was subject to identity and credit theft at a house party she hosted \nseveral years ago, and believes, without corroborating documentation, that many of the \nSOR debts resulted from that incident.   \n \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence indicating she has implemented a \nplan to resolve her debts or made any progress toward addressing them. This includes \nmultiple bad checks, although the fact she was not incarcerated tends to indicate those \nmatters were somehow resolved. This process does not demand that an applicant pay \nall of one\u2019s delinquent debts. It does, however, expect an applicant to describe a \nworkable and manageable agreement and demonstrate by documentary evidence that \na meaningful track record of timely and notable payment has been established. Here, \nApplicant simply failed to provide any documentation regarding any efforts to resolve \nher delinquent debts. \n \nMoreover, as for the multiple admitted falsifications on her past few SCAs, \nApplicant provided no documentation tending to mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. In sum, Applicant failed to mitigate both financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

He provided sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate \nthe financial problems he encountered with a residential investment property, which \nresulted in a past-due mortgage loan that was eventually resolved by a foreclosure sale \nin September 2018. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non January 25, 2017.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on February 13, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \n1 Exhibit 1. \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2018. He admitted the sole allegation \nin the SOR, which concerned a past-due mortgage loan in the amount of about $18,000 \nfor a residential investment property known herein as the Lincoln Street property. He \nalso requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me August 3, 2018. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on October 10, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-6.  Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentary exhibits were admitted as Exhibits A-C. No witnesses were called other \nthan Applicant. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received October 19, 2018.  \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. After \nmultiple extensions of time, the record closed December 31, 2018. The e-mails from \nboth Applicant and Department Counsel as well as Applicant\u2019s post-heating exhibits are \nadmitted as Exhibits D-H.  \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. He is employed as an information system security officer. He has worked for \nthe same company since 2016. He was unemployed for a four-month period during \n2016, but has otherwise been continuously employed as a federal contractor since at \nleast 2005. He is divorced with two teenage children who live with their mother in \nanother state. He owned and occupied a residential property during 1997-2009, and he \nhas since rented or leased a residence.  \n \nApplicant does not dispute a past-due mortgage loan and subsequent \nforeclosure sale of the Lincoln Street property. It was one of five residential investment \nproperties he bought in about 2005 or 2006. All five were located in the same large, \nurban city. Some properties he bought for cash at relatively low purchase prices (e.g., \n$12,000 and $14,000), while he financed the purchase of others. He purchased the \nLincoln Street property, a one-unit four-bedroom townhouse, with a mortgage loan of \nabout $75,000.   \n \nThe value of all five properties fell due to the historic bursting of the housing \nbubble.2 A new mortgage lender acquired the mortgage loan for the Lincoln Street \nproperty, and Applicant sought a loan modification without success in 2010.3 Applicant \nhoped the market would improve to allow a sale of the property, but its market value fell \n                                                          \n2 It is well known that the bursting of a real-estate bubble and the resulting credit crisis were important \nfactors in the 2007-2009 recession in the United States.  \n \n3 Tr. 28.  \n\n \n3 \n \nto about $50,000 and he could not find a buyer, so he decided to rent it.4 The property \nwas rented for about 2 years during an 11-year-period, although every rental \narrangement ended in eviction of the tenant.5 In the meantime, he kept paying on the \nmortgage loan and was unable to obtain assistance regarding a loan modification from \nthe mortgage lender.6  \n \nThe situation with the Lincoln Street property became more difficult in 2016, \nwhen Applicant lost his job and was unemployed for several months.7 As a result, he \nwas unable to make the monthly mortgage loan payment, and a foreclosure action was \ncommenced via a judicial proceeding in December 2016.8 Over the next 21 months or \nso a loan modification, short sale, and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure were attempted \nwithout success.9 The Lincoln Street property was sold in a foreclosure sale for $39,500 \nin September 2018. The report of sale filed with the court and other paperwork does not \nreflect a deficiency balance.10 At the hearing, Applicant was unware of a deficiency \nbalance, but thought he may owe real estate taxes on the property for the nine months \nhe owned it in 2018.11 In post-hearing submissions, he stated that he was told by the \nmortgage lender that he will receive a Form 1099 in January 2019.12 \n \nIn addition to the Lincoln Street property, Applicant had another problematic \nresidential investment property known herein as the Washington Street property.13 It \nwas not alleged in the SOR, but Applicant had an opportunity to discuss it during the \nhearing and he provided relevant documentation as well.14 He bought the house for \ncash for about $12,000 to $14,000 in 2005.15 The property was never occupied \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 29.  \n \n5 Tr. 29.  \n \n6 Tr. 30.  \n \n7 Tr. 30.  \n \n8 Exhibit 6.  \n \n9 Tr. 30-35.  \n \n10 Exhibit D.  \n \n11 Tr. 35-36.  \n \n12 Exhibits E, F, and G.  \n \n13 Exhibits A, B, and 5.  \n \n14 Because the Washington Street property was not alleged in the SOR, I did not consider it for \ndisqualification purposes. But I have considered it for two limited purposes: (1) it is part of the \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s investment portfolio, which was the source of his financial \ndifficulties; and (2) in evaluating the presence or absence of Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation.  \n \n15 Tr. 42; Attachment to Answer to SOR.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n(Applicant said \u201cit is just a shell\u201d),16 and he worked over the years and spent more than \n$120,000 to rehabilitate the property in order to obtain a use-and-occupancy permit \nfrom the city.17 His intention now is to sell the property.  \n \nGoing back to 2009, the city brought an action seeking an injunction, which \nresulted in a consent judgment against him for a vacant building notice on the \nWashington Street property.18 In 2012, he was found in contempt of court and a fine in \nthe amount of $14,400 was entered against him personally as the owner. Under that \nstate\u2019s law, a money judgment constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in \nland located in the county in which the judgment was entered. That meant the multiple \nproperties he owned in the same city were encumbered by the lien.  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant spoke with a representative of the city about a possible \nreduction of the fine upon obtaining a new use-and-occupancy permit for the \nWashington Street property.19 In 2013, he applied for six permits, none of which had \nfinal inspections. Several years later in August 2018, Applicant spoke to the city to \nresolve the matter. The city proposed the following offer: once the Washington Street \nproperty passes inspection and is issued a new use-and-occupancy permit, the city will \nagree to accept half of the original contempt fine ($7,200) as payment and, upon receipt \nof payment, the city will submit a notice of satisfaction to the court. After further work \nand difficulties, Applicant met the terms of the city\u2019s offer, and the case was resolved as \nreflected in an order of satisfaction of judgment filed by the city with the court on \nDecember 28, 2018.20  \n \nOther than the matters discussed above, Applicant\u2019s current financial situation \nappears to be stable. A January 2018 credit report lists the past-due mortgage loan for \nthe Lincoln Street property, but otherwise lists no derogatory financial accounts.21 At the \nhearing, Applicant stated that he had about $26,000 in checking and savings \naccounts.22 He earns an annual salary of about $150,000.23 \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n16 Attachment to Answer to SOR.  \n \n17 Tr. 42-43.  \n \n18 Exhibit A.  \n \n19 Exhibit B.  \n \n20 Exhibits E, F, and G.  \n \n21 Exhibit 3.  \n \n22 Tr. 65-66.  \n \n23 Tr. 64.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.24 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.25 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d26 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.27 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.28 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.29 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.30 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.31 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.32 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \n                                                          \n24 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n25 Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .35 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and   \n                                                          \n33 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15 \n \n34 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n35 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.   \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. In \nreaching this conclusion, I considered the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s history \nof financial problems. Obviously, the most significant circumstance was his investment \nportfolio consisting of multiple residential properties acquired during 2005 or 2006. In \nshort, it appears Applicant bit off more than he could chew. He became financially \noverextended due to the decrease in value of the properties and the various expenses \nassociated with ownership of multiple properties. Those matters were the source of his \nfinancial distress as opposed to a more typical financial case where an applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts resulted from consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or \nirresponsible spending.   \n \n \nConcerning mitigating conditions, Applicant receives credit under AG \u00b6 20(a), \nbecause his financial problems originated under usual circumstances (e.g., the bursting \nof the real-estate bubble) that are unlikely to recur. Because he resolved the \ndelinquencies on both the Lincoln and Washington Street properties, his history of \nfinancial problems does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n \n \nApplicant receives credit under AG \u00b6 20(b), because the financial problems were \ncaused, at least in part, by circumstances largely beyond his control. He bought the \nproperties in 2005 or 2006, which was near the peak of the then real-estate bubble. \nShortly thereafter the real-estate bubble burst and he suffered the consequences of \nowning multiple properties that were declining in market value. The decline in value \nresulted in difficulties in refinancing or modifying loans, and some of the properties were \ndifficult to rent or sat vacant as he worked to make them suitable for rental. In addition, \nhe acted responsibly under difficult circumstances. He did not walk away from the \nproperties or declare bankruptcy. He held onto the properties and worked over a period \nof years to salvage his investment, which is evidence of long-term commitment and \nresponsible behavior.  \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is also applicable in Applicant\u2019s favor. He presented reliable \ndocumentation showing the past-due mortgage loan on the Lincoln Street property, \nwhich is alleged in the SOR, was resolved by a foreclosure sale in September 2018, \nshortly before the hearing in this case. He expects to receive a Form 1099-C in January \n2019, which is a record of a tax liability stemming from any cancellation of indebtedness \nby the mortgage lender. Given his salary and cash reserves, he should have no \ndifficulty in paying an income tax obligation, assuming one exists.  \n \n \nLikewise, he presented reliable documentation showing satisfaction of the \njudgment in December 2018 stemming from the fine imposed on him in 2012 for the \nWashington Street property. This matter was not alleged in the SOR. Obviously, \nApplicant took far too long to resolve this matter, which began in 2009 with the filing of \nthe consent judgment. But it is noted that Applicant was working with the city on this \n\n \n8 \n \nmatter in both 2012 and 2013, the property required various repairs and improvements \nalong with inspections and permits, and he had to pay the associated expenses from his \nnormal cash flow as opposed to relying on an unlimited source of funding. These things \ntake both time and effort to accomplish.  \n \n \nConcerning the good-faith standard in AG \u00b6 20(d), I am mindful of the copious \nAppeal Board caselaw on post-SOR remedial actions in financial cases. While it\u2019s true \nthat Applicant resolved both the past-due mortgage loan and the unpaid judgment after \nissuance of the SOR, it\u2019s also true that he worked on an on-again, off-again basis to \nresolve the issues with these two properties over a period of years that preceded the \nSOR. In other words, this is not a case where Applicant was engaged in massive \nprocrastination or simply ignored the problem and only took action upon receipt of the \nSOR. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I am satisfied that the totality of his \nremedial efforts were made in good faith and were not done simply in response to the \nSOR.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Prior to the hearing on November 29, \n2018, I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion.

He subsequently \nmoved his family to state C when it became too difficult for them to live apart. They \ninitially rented, and then they bought a home in state C in 2007. He rented his home in \nstate B, but the tenants did not pay the equivalent of his monthly mortgage so he was \nresponsible for paying the difference.9 \nIn 2008, the housing market crashed. In 2009, Applicant rented his first home in \nstate C and purchased another home in state C, because his first home was too small \nfor his family. He had three separate renters for his first home in state C; each of them \ndid not pay the equivalent of his monthly mortgage for that home, so he was responsible \nfor paying the difference. His last renters for his first home in state C eventually stopped \npaying their rent.10 \nIn 2011, Applicant\u2019s tenants moved out of his home in state B, and he was \nresponsible for the mortgages on his homes in both states B and C. He became \nunemployed for approximately four to six months in 2014 or 2015, and he supported his \nfamily with money solely from his savings and 401k retirement plan.

Her issues progressively worsened over the years. He earned \napproximately $80,000 to $90,000 annually when his wife\u2019s medical issues began. \nThough they have had health insurance, they incurred significant out-of-pocket costs for \nthe specialists his wife has seen over the years.12 \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a mortgage account for the home Applicant owns in state B. The \naccount is $28,320 past due with a total loan balance of $391,740. He purchased this \nhome in 2005 for $365,000, and he refinanced it several months later for $417,000. \nApplicant testified that he completed two loan modifications: the first in 2007 or 2008, \nwhen he was first delinquent on his mortgage, and the second in April 2018. During the \nsecond loan modification process, the initial mortgage holder sold the account to the \ncurrent mortgage holder and the $39,000 past-due amount was forgiven. He provided \ndocumentation, executed by both himself and his mortgage holder, to corroborate his \nclaim. His total loan balance was $360,000, for which he was paying $3,100 monthly. \nHe testified that he made a total of four to five monthly mortgage payments between \nApril 2018 and the date of the hearing. He acknowledged that he was $6,000 to $9,000 \ndelinquent on this mortgage.13 \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for an $83,301 charged-off home equity line of credit (HELOC) from \nApplicant\u2019s home in state B. He obtained the HELOC in approximately 2007, to pay for \nhis family\u2019s moving expenses from state B state C. He also used $55,000 as a down \npayment for his first home in state C. He testified that he made three to four payments \ntowards the HELOC, but stopped until he completed the first loan modification for SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. He became delinquent on the HELOC in 2011. He testified that he worked with \nthe Lexington Law Firm to verify the debt; he then made several monthly payments of \n$250 towards the HELOC in accordance with a payment plan beginning in the summer \nof 2018. He provided documentation reflecting such monthly payments from June to \nNovember 2018. He acknowledged that he missed some monthly payments. He \ntestified that the total balance remaining of the HELOC was approximately $81,000.14 \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are for mortgage accounts that were foreclosed in \napproximately October 2016 and October 2017, respectively, after Applicant defaulted \non both loans.

His second home was foreclosed in approximately October 2016.15 \nApplicant testified that he was in the process of a loan modification when his \nsecond home was foreclosed, and he unsuccessfully attempted to settle the mortgage \naccount when he contacted the creditor. He stayed in his second home in state C until \nJune 2017, when he then returned to live in his first home in state C. In October 2017, \nhis first home in state C was foreclosed. He lived in the home until December 2017. He \nindicated that he had not been contacted by either creditor about any deficiency \nbalances for his first or second homes in state C, and he was working with the \nLexington Law Firm to attempt to remove both mortgage accounts from his credit \nreport.16 \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $21,761 charged-off account. Applicant testified that he was \nunsure about this debt. He did not recall having a credit card with this creditor since \n1992, and he did not realize that the indebtedness on the card was $21,000. He testified \nthat he was working with the Lexington Law Firm to validate it. If the account is \nvalidated, he intends to work out a payment plan with the creditor to resolve this debt.17 \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a $3,195 charged-off account. Applicant testified that he was \nalso working with the Lexington Law Firm to validate this debt, as he did not recall \nhaving a credit card with this creditor since 2010.18 \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g to 1.j and 1.l through 1.n are for seven delinquent medical accounts \ntotaling $4,161. Applicant testified that these debts are a result of his wife\u2019s medical \nissues, as previously discussed. He contacted a debt-resolution company, Freedom \nDebt Relief, to assist him with resolving his wife\u2019s medical expenses once he saw them \nreported on his credit report. He paid the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n, \nfor which he testified that Freedom Debt Relief successfully negotiated a settlement. He \nalso testified that Freedom Debt Relief referred him to the Lexington Law Firm, who is \nworking to validate the remaining medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j, before he \npays them.19 \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is for a $450 charged-off department-store credit card. Applicant \ntestified that he was unaware of this debt because he did not receive correspondence \nfrom the creditor due to his family\u2019s various moves. He worked with Freedom Debt \nRelief and paid this debt.20 \n15 Tr. at 56-60, 70-74, 82-92, 133-134; GE 1. \n16 Tr. at 56-60, 70-74, 82-92, 133-134; GE 1. \n17 Tr. at 60, 92-94; AE O. \n18 Tr. at 60-61, 92-94; AE O. \n19 Tr. at 61-66, 85-86, 94-97; AE E, G, H, I, O. \n20 Tr. at 66, 85-86, 95-96, 125-127; AE F, L. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is for an August 2018 state tax lien of $5,303, and SOR \u00b6 1.p is for a \nSeptember 2018 federal tax lien of $25,789. Applicant testified that he has timely filed \nall of his federal and state income tax returns. He indicated that the liens in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o \nand 1.p are for outstanding federal and state taxes for tax year 2016, because he \nclaimed more dependents that tax year so that he could receive more money per \npaycheck to apply towards his debts. He testified that he started making payments \ntowards his outstanding federal and state taxes, but stopped when he had to pay other \ndebts, to include his wife\u2019s medical expenses. He testified that he was paying his \noutstanding federal taxes through a payment plan with the IRS in 2017, but he stopped \nwhen he was locked out of his account. He testified that he was unaware that liens were \nfiled against him until he received the amended SOR. He was going to verify the \nbalance of his outstanding liens and then attempt to negotiate a payment plan to resolve \nthem. He was also going to adjust his withholdings, as he had not yet done so as of the \ndate of the hearing.21 \nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly pay as of the date of the hearing was between $6,000 \nand $9,000. He previously grossed $4,000 to $7,000 monthly from 2014 to 2017. He \nhas approximately $8,000 in his 401k retirement plan and he does not have any \nsavings. His wife has not worked outside of the home since 1996. His motorcycle was \nrepossessed in September 2018, and he drives a rental car for which he pays $185 \nweekly. He pays $3,100 monthly for his home in state B where his family lives; he also \npays $500 monthly for a rental apartment in state C where he lives. His wife manages \nthe family\u2019s finances. While he initially neglected to develop a budget, he provided \ndocumentation reflecting that he compiled one. He acknowledged that there are times \nwhen he finds himself with a monthly negative net remainder.22 \nApplicant testified that he began working with Freedom Debt Relief in \napproximately 2015 to negotiate settlements and payment plans with his creditors. He \nhad a second job that enabled him to pay Freedom Debt Relief $1,012 monthly. He \npaused his payments in the summer of 2018 when he no longer had the second job, \nand he planned to resume payments once he obtained another. He testified that he has \nbeen working with the Lexington Law Firm since approximately 2016 to validate his \ndebts, and he pays them $99 monthly. He testified that he has not received financial \ncounseling.23 \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor since November 2017 testified that he met Applicant \nin 2011, when they worked together for another employer, and he recruited Applicant for \ntheir current contract. He interacts with Applicant daily. He was aware that Applicant \nhad significant financial concerns affecting Applicant\u2019s security clearance, as Applicant \ndisclosed them to him several months prior to the hearing date.

He described their relationship as \nprimarily a professional one, but indicated that they also became personally acquainted \nwhen they worked for their prior employer. He learned in 2012 about Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nmedical issues, and testified that he would not be surprised if they amassed medical \nbills as a result. He testified that he had recently learned there were questions about \npossible financial stability affecting Applicant\u2019s security clearance, but he was unaware \nof the amount of Applicant\u2019s financial indebtedness. He described Applicant\u2019s \nperformance for their prior employer as superior. He testified that he had not witnessed \nApplicant\u2019s performance for their current employer because he works in a different \ndepartment. He described Applicant\u2019s work ethic as without question, and Applicant as \na trustworthy individual. Additional character references, to include previous coworkers, \ndescribed Applicant as a reliable and trustworthy individual.25 \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n24 Tr. at 27-38; AE B, C. \n25 Tr. at 38-47; AE B. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts, to include his federal and state taxes. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) as disqualifying \nconditions. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. He started working with Freedom Debt Relief in 2015 and the Lexington \nLaw Firm in 2016. As he paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n, I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies to these five debts. \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j, as well as the liens in \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 1.o \nand 1.p, remain outstanding. Applicant is also delinquent on his mortgage for his home \nand the HELOC from that home in state B (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b). He provided no evidence \nthat he successfully disputed, paid, began paying, or was working out a payment plan \nfor any of his remaining delinquent debts. He has not received credit counseling. \nThough he compiled a budget, he did so after the hearing date. He acknowledged that \nthere are times when he finds himself with a monthly negative net remainder.

I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.

Based on all available information, I find that Applicant has disputed \nthis debt, and it is not yet resolved. This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant failed to file a Federal income tax return, as required, for 2014. He also \nfailed to file, as required, state tax returns for six years. Many other Federal and state tax \nreturns were filed late. He has a substantial Federal tax debt that is not yet resolved. In \naddition, there are past-due consumer debts. These facts establish prima facie support \nfor the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthose concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s substantial financial issues, including unpaid \ntaxes, failure to timely file tax returns, and unpaid bills: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid Federal back taxes are still due and owing. Applicant did not \nsupply documentation to show that he has filed all of his past-due Federal and state tax \nreturns. Nor did he submit any evidence to show that he has entered into a current \npayment arrangement with the IRS or any state taxing authority, and is in compliance with \nsuch arrangements if he had filed tax returns and owed taxes. There is no evidence that \nthe debt in allegation 1.k has been resolved. Applicant did not supply any information to \nsupport a finding that his financial problems were beyond his control, or that he had acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(a), (b), (c), (d), and (g) do not apply.  \n \nApplicant submitted disputes to the credit reporting services concerning \nallegations 1.i, 1.j, and 1.l. The disputes had not been resolved as of the date the record \nclosed. AG 20(e) applies to those debts, and the allegations are found for Applicant. With \nthose exceptions, Applicant did not mitigate his tax and other financial issues. Guideline \nF is found against Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that the back taxes and other debts were being resolved, or \nthat he had filed all of his tax returns. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress \nremains undiminished. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \n\n \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i through 1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted. \nHistory of Case\nOn April 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications\nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DoD\nadjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security\nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD) 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/27/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 17, 2018, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 5, 2018, and was scheduled for hearing on July 26,\n2018. A hearing was convened as scheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. At hearing, the Government's case consisted of two \nexhibits, which were admitted without objection; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nand seven exhibits, which were admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on August 3,  2018.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of\ndetailed facts taken from five U.S. Government official publications. Administrative or\nofficial notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See\nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007);  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law,\nSec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). \nFor good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the\nabove-named background reports containing the identified facts in Department\nCounsel\u2019s Request for Administration Notice regarding the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n(Saudi Arabia) that addresses the geopolitical situation in Saudi Arabia.  Administrative\nNotice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent  with the provisions of\nRule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. \nExcept for the specific facts referenced by Department Counsel in her\nadministrative notice, request, Applicant was not foreclosed from challenging the\naccuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports addressing Saudi\nArabia\u2019s  current status. Department Counsel\u2019s Administrative Notice Request was\nreceived as HE 1.\nProcedural Rulings \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of Applicant\u2019s\nsponsor\u2019s continued sponsorship of Applicant for a security clearance. For good cause\nshown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. Department Counsel\nwas afforded three days to respond.  \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a letter from his\nsponsor confirming its continued sponsorship of Applicant for a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission was admitted without objection as AE H.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guidelines B and L (by incorporation), Applicant allegedly provided\nexecutive security service from 2005 to present to an important high ranking Saudi\nofficial, who is a citizen and resident of Saudi Arabia, and who previously served as an\n2\n\nimportant high ranking official of Saudi Arabia and formerly a senior military officer in the\nSaudi Army. Under Guideline L, Applicant allegedly worked for A Company Ltd, a\ncompany from approximately 2005 to present, which could result in a conflict with your\ncurrent employment.  \nIn his  response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations with explanations. He\nclaimed he no longer provides any services for the company identified in SOR \u00b6 2.a. or\nhave any contract with the same company or any high-ranking Saudi officials. He further\nclaimed that all information has been deleted in accordance with his deed of disclaimer.\nApplicant claimed that both his father, himself, and his only son are proud Marines.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old armed security officer (currently sponsored by a defense\ncontractor) who seeks a security clearance. Findings of fact follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant married in December 1996 and has two adult children from this\nmarriage.: one in the Marine Corps. and another in college. (GE 1; Tr. 37) He attended\nvocational classes between June 2002 and June 2016 but did not  earn a degree or\ndiploma. (GEs 1-2) He enlisted in the Marine Corps in June 1992 and served four years of\nactive duty. During his enlistment, he completed dog training, and thereafter became a\ndog trainer. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 37) Applicant received a honorable discharge in June 1996. \nFollowing his Marine Corps discharge, Applicant trained bomb-sniffing dogs for a\nsecurity protection program for several years (1996-1999) (Tr. 50) Between 1999 and\n2005, he worked for a closely-held corporation as an executive protection officer that\nprovided protection services for children. (Tr. 64-65, 67)\nBetween August 2005 and July 2017, Applicant worked contemporaneously as a\nself-employed security consultant for a private firm (A Company Ltd.), whose principal\nclient was a high-ranking Saudi official (X), a citizen and resident of Saudi Arabia, and\nwho previously served as a high-ranking Saudi military official. (GEs 1-2) Applicant was\nintroduced to A Company Ltd\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO) by a friend (C) who ran\nsecurity details for another high-ranking Saudi official (Y) between 2005 and 2012. (Tr.\n68, 71-72)  \nWorking for Saudi official X was C\u2019s main source of income before starting his own\ncompany in 2012. (Tr. 68-69) While employed by A Company Ltd., Applicant earned\n$100,000 annually during his years of service. (Tr. 46) When working with X in the 2009-\n2013 time frame, Applicant performed various security duties for X\u2019s wife and five children\nwho were in boarding schools in the United States. (GE 2 and A-B; Tr. 67)\nBetween 2012 and 2018, Applicant worked for Company B as a security\nconsultant. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 70-72) Company B continues to sponsor Applicant despite the\n3\n\nfact that it doesn\u2019t presently have a need for his services. (AE H) Applicant remains on\nretainer with Company B pending (a) his obtaining a security clearance and (b) the\ncompany acquires DoD contracts that will create needs for Applicant\u2019s services. (Tr. 70-\n74-75, 78-81) In the meantime, Applicant continues to provide security consulting\nservices for another company that does not require a security clearance. (Tr. 81-82) \nApplicant\u2019s contract with A Company Ltd. was terminated with an effective\ntermination date of October 2017. (AE A) Supporting documents in his termination\npackage include a confidentiality deed of general release and a deed of disclaimer. (AE\nA) Severance payments were set at $50,000, in addition to payments of fees accrued\nbetween July 2017 and October 2017. (AE A) Since his separation from A Company Ltd,\nApplicant has had no further dealings with this firm or X. (Tr. 76)\nWhen working with Saudi official B, Applicant performed various security duties for\nX\u2019s wife and five children.  (GE 2 and AEs A-B; Tr. 64-65) Applicant\u2019s principal duties to X\ninvolved executive protection and entailed extensive travel outside the United States\n(mostly to and from Saudi Arabia).  \nCountry status of Saudi Arabia\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by King Bin Abdulagiza al Saud\nwho is both the head of state and head of government. Albeit, since June 2017,\nsupervision of the affairs of the Saudi government have been delegated to Y. (AEs C-G\nand I) \nThe Saudi government bases its legitimacy on its interpretations of Sharia (Islamic\nlaw) and the 1992 Basic Law which specifies that the rules of the country shall be made\nby descendants of King Abdulaziz al Saul. See Administrative Notice at 2; Saudi Arabia\nHuman Rights Report, U.S. Dept.  of State (April 2018).\nSince Saudi official Y\u2019s elevation in June 2017 (placing him in line to succeed his\nfather), he has gone to great lengths to assert his rule as the sharer of the Kingdom\u2019s\nnational security and economic policies. The effect has been to consolidate authority\nunder one individual and sub-branch of the family-a move unprecedented in the Kingdom\nsince its founding under th late Ibn Saud. (AEs B-G and I)  Under the leadership of Saudi\nofficial Y, Saudi Arabia has activated a more assertive posture, typified by the Kingdom\u2019s\nmilitary operations in neighboring Yemen and its insistence on the departure of President\nBashar al Assad in Syria. (AEs B\u2013G and I)\nThe Obama Administration, like its predecessors, engaged the Saudi government\nas a strategic partner to promote regional security and global economic stability. (AEs B-\nG and I) Building on discord that emerged between the Obama Administration and Saudi\nleaders over differences of opinion over Iran, Syria, and Yemen, Saudi leaders, among\nother issues, President Trump and King Salman forged a new strategic partnership in\nJanuary 2017 for the 21  century in the interest of both countries by formally announcing\nst\na Joint strategic Vision. (AEs B-G and I) \n4\n\nSince 2011, significant changes in political and economic conditions in the Middle\nEast have shifted international attention on Saudi domestic policy issues and\nstrengthened social and political debates among Saudi Arabia and its historical allies.\n(AEs B-G and I) Issues include political reform, unemployment, education, human rights,\ncorruption, religious freedom, and extremism.\nTravel warnings and terrorist threats\nDue to the increased exposure to terrorism for Americans visiting Saudi Arabia, the\nState Department has issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory regarding Saudi Arabia, advising\nU.S. travelers to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d while visiting Saudi Arabia due to terrorism\nand the threat of missile attacks on civilian targets. See Administrative Notice, supra,\nciting Saudi Arabia Travel Advisory, U.S. Dept. of State (April 2018)\nRebel groups operating in Yemen have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia,\ntargeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure. Missile attacks emanating from these\ngroups have targeted major cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah. See Administrative Notice,\nsupra and  Saudi Arabia Travel Advisory, supra.  Violence in Yemen has spilled over into\nSaudi Arabia on a number of occasions. See id.\nBoth ISIS and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) contrive to encourage\nindividual acts of terrorism within the Kingdom. ISIS attacks against Saudi security forces,\nShia mosques, community center, and western targets in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC) states in 2016 demonstrate the seriousness of the posed \nthreats to Saudi Arabia and the region by ISIS. Administrative Notice, supra, at 3; Country\nReports on Terrorism 2016, at 219, U.S. Dept. Of State (July 2017): \nReligious freedom and human rights issues\nBecause the Saudi legal system is based on Sharia, freedom of religious enjoys no\nprotected status in the Kingdom. See Administrative Notice, supra; Saudi Arabia 2017,\nInt\u2019l Religious Freedom Report, U.S. Dept. of State (April 2017). The 1992 Basic Law\ncriminalizes the promotion of atheistic ideologies in any form and other acts considered\ncontrary to Sharia, including non-Islamic public worship, public display of non-Islamic\nreligious symbols, conversion by a Muslim to another religion, and proselytizing by a non-\nMuslim. See id. \nHuman rights abuses also continue to plague Saudi Arabian governance.\nExamples include unlawful killings (including execution for other than the most serious\noffenses) without due process, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, political prisoners,\narbitrary interference with privacy, restrictions on freedom of expression, restrictions on\npeaceful assembly, association, movement, and religion. See Administrative Notice,\nsupra, at 4, citing Saudi Arabia 2017 Human Rights Report at 1, U.S. Dept. Of State (April\n2018). Other Saudi restrictions include the lack of ability and legal means to choose their\ngovernment through free and fair elections, trafficking in persons, violence and official\n5\n\ngender discrimination against women (mitigated in part by newly announced women\u2019s\nrights initiatives), and criminalization of same sex sexual activity. See id.\nOther stress points in U.S.-Saudi relations \nFollowing U.S. Senate review of the reported brutal murder of U.S.-residing\njournalist Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit team in 2018, the U.S. Senate in December\n2018 passed a resolution condemning Saudi official Y for his believed orchestrated\nmurder of the journalist See Senate Rebukes Trump, condemns Saudi Official A for\nKhashoggi Murder. https://www.cnn.com  (Dec. 13, 2018). The manifest intent of the\nresolution was to ratchet pressure on President Trump who reportedly appeared to align\nhimself with the Saudi Kingdom for economic reasons and a perceived desire to withhold\nsanctions on the Kingdom for strategic political reasons.\nJust prior to passing its resolution by voice vote, the U.S. Senate also unanimously\napproved a resolution by a 56-41 vote that requires the United States to end its military\nsupport of the Saudi-led war in Yemen. See Senate Rebukes Trump, condemns Saudi\nOfficial A for Khashoggi Murder https://www.cnn.com, supra  (Dec. 13, 2018) While both of\nthe Senate-passed resolutions amounted to significant breaks within Congress with the\nU..S. administration toward Saudi Arabia, neither resolution was followed by comparable\naction in the House, and, as a result, never reached the President for consideration. The\nPresident, though, has to date steered clear of blaming Y, and considers Saudi Arabia to\nbe a very good ally. See id.\nThe Senate vote on the Yemen resolution manifestly reflected frustration with the\nrepeated human casualties from the War in Yemen and the Administration\u2019s embrace of\nSaudi official A, despite widely accepted evidence from U.S. intelligence agencies that A \nordered the killing  of Khashoggi. See Senate Rebukes Trump, condemns Saudi Official A\nfor Khashoggi Murder https://www.com (Dec. 13, 2018), supra. To what extent President\nTrump will go in endorsing and implementing the Senate\u2019s passed resolutions is unclear at\nthis point.            \nPotential Applicant conflicts of interest   \nPotential conflicts of interest arise as the result of Applicant\u2019s acceptance of the\ndisclaimer agreement he signed with A Company Ltd. following his separation from the\nfirm July 2018. (AE H) Under the terms of the agreement with his former employer,\nApplicant is obligated to retain and withhold any information he acquired during their 12-\nyear employment relationship. (AE A) Information terms include trade secrets, technology\nor commercial information of the company and/or Saudii official X and/or any other\nmember of Saudi official X\u2019s family (inclusive of Saudi official Y) and/or any other\ncompany, entity or organization directly or indirectly associated with Y and his family,\nwhich he may have received or obtained while in the service of the company. (AE A) \nBy the termination agreement\u2019s terms, the specified disclosure restrictions shall\ncontinue to apply to Applicant following the termination of his consulting agreement without\n6\n\nlimit in point of time, save for information which may come into the public domain\notherwise than through unauthorized disclosure. (AE A)  Whether the non-disclosure\nprovisions were intended to apply to persons with conflicting responsibilities imposed by\ntheir government-issued security clearances, or can be preempted in a proper case is\nunclear.\nWhile these disclosure restrictions may be typical of termination agreements\nreached in standard commercial relationships, they create potential irreconcilable conflicts\nwhen they involve high-level officials of a country (Saudi Arabia in this case) with far-\nreaching connections with the United States. In this context, potential conflicts can be\nenvisioned where Applicant is placed in a position where he has to make a choice\nbetween honoring the anti-disclosure terms of his termination agreement and protecting\nthe security interests of the United States. Under these special circumstances, potential\nirreconcilable conflicts of interest between Applicant and his former employer (A Company\nLtd) and U.S. security interests cannot be ruled out.      \n          \n                       \nPolicies\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by administrative\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the\n\"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should\nbe granted, continued or denied.  \nThe Guidelines do not require the administrative judge to assess these factors\nexclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines,\nadministrative judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of\nthe Directive, which are intended to assist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nfactors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern. Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited\nto, business, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern\nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security\nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of\nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the\n7\n\nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited, considerations\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  See \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 6.\n \n                        Outside activities\nThe Concern. Involvement in certain types of outside employment or\nactivities is of security concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an\nindividual\u2019s security responsibilities and could create an increased risk of\nunauthorized disclosure of classified or sensitive information (AG) \u00b6 33.\n                                    Burden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue  \nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a  threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, factual findings\ncannot be drawn from inferences grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to\naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified\ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must\ntake account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nsafeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth and an honorably discharged Marine who\nretained business interests for many years with a firm whose principal client was X. \nSecurity issues of concern to the Government focus on potential conflicts of interest\nbetween Applicant and the disclosure restrictions imposed on him in his exit agreement\nwith Company A Ltd. and the potential conflicts of interest with the United States with his\nacquiring a security clearance.\n8\n\nJurisdictional issues\nApplicant\u2019s employment relationship with his current sponsor (Company B) is a bit \nambiguous when it comes to establishing a prospective start-up date for Applicant. While\nApplicant\u2019s employer of over six years continues to list its sponsorship of Applicant for a\nsecurity clearance in the Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) and reaffirmed its\nintention to employ Applicant in the future once he obtains a security clearance, Company\nB does not currently include Applicant on its payroll and has not provided Applicant with\nany assurances as to when he can be expected to be hired once he obtains a clearance.\nTo meet his expense needs, Applicant has had to secure other sources of employment\nthat do not require a security clearance.  \nProcedures established by DoD Directive 5220.6 mandate that actions initiated\nunder the Directive shall cease \u201cupon termination of the applicant\u2019s need for access to\nclassified information, except in those cases in which one of the following occurs: a\nhearing has commenced (\u00b6 4.4.2); a clearance decision has been issued; (\u00b6 4.4.3), or the\napplicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended and the applicant provided a written request\nthat the case continue (\u00b6 4.4.1).\u201d See Directive 5220.6, \u00b6\u00b6 4.4 et seq. Because the hearing\nin Applicant\u2019s case had commenced (\u00b6 4.4.2) before his current need for a clearance could\nbe fully explored, the case was able to proceed on the merits. Whether Company B will\never obtain the DoD contract it will need to utilize Applicant\u2019s services is unclear at this\npoint. While this leaves Applicant\u2019s current need to know in uncertain status, jurisdiction is\nretained.\nForeign influence concerns\nGovernment urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s listed employment\nrelationship with A Company Ltd could potentially compromise his responsibilities with the\nUnited States as clearance holder with access to classified information. While Applicant\nhas since terminated his service arrangements with A Company Ltd. The disclosure\nrestrictions he agreed to in 2017 could potentially place him at risk of having to make an\nelection as to whether to honor his anti-disclosure obligations even if it could impact the\nU.S. security interests he has sworn to protect, or breach his agreement\u2019s anti-disclosure\nprovisions to provide needed intelligence information to DoD agencies. This potentially\nexposes Applicant to a potential Hobson\u2019s choice that could place him at heightened risk\nof making an election that could potentially harm U.S. security interests. \nBecause Applicant is potentially exposed to being placed in a conflict of interest\nsituation due to his past business relationships with A Company Ltd and high-ranking\nSaudi official B in particular, two disqualifying conditions apply. Both DC 7(a), \u00b6 7(a),\n\u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion,\u201d and DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\n9\n\nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d apply to\nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nThe potential for conflicts of interest for an applicant with contractual obligations to\na company or persons whose citizenship or resident status in a country who presents a\nheightened risk to U.S. security interests poses potential security risks. Saudi Arabia has a\nlong and valued history as a strategic partner of the United States in commerce and\nforeign affairs. The country also creates ongoing security concerns over its human rights\nrecord, its toleration for terrorist groups operating within its borders, and its embrace of\nSharia and other state practices that offend U.S. moral foundations and legal traditions.  \nThese risks identifiable above are manageable, though, and are reconcilable with\nU.S. security interests for several reasons. Longstanding political and commercial relations\nbetween the United States and Saudi Arabia, shared security interests in the Middle East\nbetween the United States and Saudi Arabia, and Applicant\u2019s demonstrated strong\nloyalties to the United States and manifest commitments to protect this country\u2019s security\ninterests under any and all circumstances make unlikely any Saudi efforts to pressure or\ncoerce Applicant into disclosing classified or sensitive information in his possession.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with conflicting interests in foreign\ncountries in general. What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing in the supplied\nmaterials and country information about Saudi Arabia. \nThe AGs do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the United\nStates as an important consideration in gauging whether a potential conflict of interest in a\nparticular case is outweighed by the applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalties and commitments\nto protecting U.S. security interests at all costs. Still, the geopolitical aims and policies of\nthe particular foreign regime involved do matter. \n In Applicant\u2019s case, his demonstrated loyalties and commitment to protecting U.S.\nsecurity interests enable him to take advantage of one important mitigating condition: MC\n\u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d In the hypothetical situation where Applicant\u2019 is presented with an\nactual choice of which set of obligations he should adhere (i.e., his anti-disclosure duties to\nA Company Ltd of U.S. security interests), Applicant\u2019s demonstrated strong loyalties,\npatriotism, and security commitments to the United States make it very unlikely that he\nwould permit himself to be pressured into compromising classified information. \n10\n\nOf full benefit to Applicant, too, is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty,\npatriotism, and professional commitments to the United States are well demonstrated and\nenough under these circumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his\npast relationships with A Company Ltd and high-ranking Saudi official X.\nOutside activities concerns\nPotential conflicts of interest that are presented by Applicant\u2019s past consulting\nagreement with A Company Ltd. and work for X are raised under Guideline L for\nessentially the same reasons that are covered by the Government\u2019s raised foreign\ninfluence concerns. One  disqualifying condition applies to Applicant\u2019s situation here: DC\n\u00b6\u00b6 37(a), \u201cany employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with: (1) the\ngovernment of a foreign country: (2) and foreign national, organization, or other entity; (3)\na representative of any foreign interest; an (4) any foreign, domestic, or international\norganization or person engaged in analysis, discussion, or publication of material on\nintelligence, defense, foreign affairs, or protected technology.\nFor the same reasons covered in the analysis of Applicant\u2019s potential conflict of\ninterests as the result of his long working relationships with A Company Ltd. and X,\nApplicant\u2019s actions can be favorably reconciled with his proven strong and lasting \ndevotion to the security interests of the United States. MC \u00b6 38(b), \u201cthe individual\nterminated the employment or discontinued the activity upon being notified that it was in\nconflict with his or her security responsibilities,\u201d has some application to the facts in\nApplicant\u2019s case. Full application of this mitigating condition cannot be applied only\nbecause Applicant ended his consulting relationship with A Company Ltd. in 2017\nvoluntarily without any prior notice of any potential conflict with the security responsibilities\nhe could be expected to assume with a security clearance.\nWhole-person assessment\nWhole-person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\npotential conflicts of interests with his A Company Ltd and HRS consulting connections.\nNot only is Applicant a loyal and dedicated U.S. patriot with strong Marine Corps values\ninstilled in him, but he has made every effort to defend U.S. security interests in the past\nwhere potential conflicts could arise. Applicant is well regarded and trusted by his sponsor\nwho continues to look for DoD contracts where it can utilize Applicant\u2019s professional\nservices. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought\nto bear on him as the result of his past consulting arrangements with A Company Ltd and\nHRH would appear to be minimal. By all reasonable accounts of the presented record, \n11\n\nApplicant has no visible conflicts of interest with A Company Ltd and X that could be at\nrealistic risk to exploitation or compromise. \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's past business\nrelationships in Saudi Arabia are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments\nabout his ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his prior business\nrelationships in Saudi Arabia. His demonstrated loyalties and commitments to protecting\nU.S. security interests make it highly unlikely he would succumb to any foreign influence\nbrought to bear on himself by A Company Ltd., high ranking Saudi official X,  or any Saudi\nofficials. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nGuidelines B and L.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1-a                                              For Applicant\nGUIDELINE L: (OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES):\n          FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:\n                                For Applicant\n \n \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.  \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 14, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for access to classified information \nas part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the completed \nbackground investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information.1 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive). \n01/02/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nOn June 8, 2018, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns addressed under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct).2 Applicant timely responded to the SOR \n(Answer) and requested a decision without a hearing.  \n \nOn August 10, 2018, Department Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM)3 in support of the SOR. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 14, 2018, and he was informed he had 30 days \nfrom the date of receipt to object to the use of the information included in the FORM and \nto submit additional information in response to the FORM.4 The record closed on \nSeptember 28, 2018, after Applicant did not respond to the FORM or object to the \nconsideration of any of the Government\u2019s exhibits. I received this case for decision on \nDecember 21, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $22,158.40 for \nsix delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f). SOR 1.a addressed a $3,409 delinquent \nfederal income tax debt for the 2015 tax year, and SOR 1.f addressed a $1,872 debt for \nunpaid state personal property taxes in the 2015 tax year. The remaining allegations \naddressed a total of $16,876 for four delinquent or past-due personal credit accounts. In \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but SOR 1.e, claiming without any \ndocumentary support that he had paid that debt. (FORM, Item 1) \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant intentionally made a \nfalse official statement when he omitted from a July 2009 e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR \n1.a \u2013 1.e (SOR 2.a). The record compiled in support of the SOR did not support that \nallegation. As provided for by section E3.1.13 of the Directive, Department Counsel \namended the SOR by withdrawing SOR 2.a. (FORM, Section III at 2) Accordingly, only \nthe issues raised under Guideline F were before me for decision. \n \n \nAll of the SOR allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR \n(FORM, Item 1) and in statements he made during two personal subject interviews (PSI) \non July 19 and August 15, 2017. Additionally, the information presented in two credit \nreports (FORM, Items 4 and 5) and documents from the IRS (FORM, Item 6) and the tax \nauthority in the state where Applicant lives (FORM, Item 7) support the SOR allegations \nunder Guideline F. In addition to the facts thus established, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked since March 2010. Applicant\u2019s federal income tax debt arose from early \n                                                 \n2 See Directive, Enclosure 2. \n3 See Directive, Section E3.1.7. In the FORM, Department Counsel relies on seven enclosed exhibits (Items \n1 \u2013 7). \n4 See Directive, Section E3.1.7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwithdrawal penalties from his 401k account to make a down payment on his home. The \nfunds he withdrew became taxable income that Applicant failed to declare on his 2015 \nincome tax returns. (FORM, Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s state property tax debt is actually due for the 2016 tax year, not for \n2015 as alleged in SOR 1.f. Applicant incurred this debt for not paying the taxes \nassociated with his mortgage. His taxes and insurance were not bundled with the \nmortgage and interest payments each month. The record does not contain any \nexplanation of why Applicant did not pay his property taxes in 2016. (FORM, Ite 3) \n \n \nDuring his PSIs, Applicant stated his intention to use his 2017 income tax refund, \nalong with a home equity loan, to resolve all of his outstanding debts. Applicant did not \nsubmit, either with his response to the SOR or by responding to the FORM, any \ninformation that shows he has acted to resolve any of his debts. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the \nnew guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are: \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. Department Counsel must produce sufficient reliable \ninformation on which DOD based its preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security \nclearance for an applicant. Additionally, Department Counsel must prove controverted \n                                                 \n5 See Directive, 6.3. \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n\n \n4 \n \nfacts alleged in the SOR.7 If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant \nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the case for disqualification.8 \n \n  \nBecause no one is entitled to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden \nof persuasion to establish that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for them to \nhave access to protected information. A person who has access to such information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. \nThus, there is a compelling need to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the nation\u2019s interests as \nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation in favor of the Government.9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThis record reasonably raises the security concern expressed at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, this record requires application of the disqualifying conditions at \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations); and 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \n \nBy contrast, none of the information presented in this record supports application \nof any of the pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions. The record shows Applicant\u2019s debts \nare current, insofar as they are still unresolved; that he has not made any payments to \nthose debts; that he has not sought any professional financial assistance or counseling \n                                                 \n7 See Directive, E3.1.14. \n8 See Directive, E3.1.15. \n9 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n\n \n5 \n \nto improve his finances; and that he has not paid his tax debts. The security concerns \nraised by the adverse information about Applicant\u2019s finances are not mitigated. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). My review of all of the available \ninformation leaves unanswered the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information that were raised by his financial problems. Because protection of \nthe national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved against the individual. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nWITHDRAWN \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal \nConduct and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 14, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2018.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on October 22, \n2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 27, 2018. The \nGovernment offered three exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered no exhibits.  Applicant \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ntestified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 7, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old, and is married with five children.

During his personal subject interview on November 9, 2017, Applicant told \nthe investigator that he continues to consume alcohol and then operates motor vehicles \nwhile impaired. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he began consuming alcohol at the young age of 14.  When \nhe started, he was drinking maybe four or five beers on the weekend.  (Tr.  p. 18.)  By \nage 18, through his mid-20\u2019s, he was consuming alcohol once or twice a week, and \neach time he drank to the point of intoxication.       \n \n \nIn September 1997, Applicant was first arrested and charged with DUI.  Applicant \nwas arrested after he struck a parked vehicle.  His blood alcohol level was .18.  \nApplicant states that he was leaving a gathering with some friends and had consumed \nabout 16 beers over a period of 6 hours.  He smashed the front passenger side of his \nvehicle.  After he was arrested, he was taken to jail.  His license was suspended and he \nwas fined approximately $700.  He was also required to complete a driver\u2019s education \nclass.  (Tr. p. 21.)   Applicant states that following this DUI, he stopped drinking for \nabout a month.  He then returned to his regular drinking pattern. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn January 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  This time he \nrear ended another vehicle at a stop light.  At the time of his arrest, Applicant blood \nalcohol level was .2.  Applicant explained that he was coming from a co-workers house \nwhere he had consumed about 20 beers over a period of six hours.  Applicant was \nfound guilty of the charge.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended for a year, he was fined \n$1,300 that he completed with community service, he was required to attend 20 \nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings, and also a driver\u2019s education class.  Applicant states \nthat he completed all of the courts requirements.  (Tr. p. 24.)  Following this arrest, \nApplicant stopped drinking for about two months.  (Tr. p. 25.) \n \n \nIn November 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI a third time.  \nApplicant was pulled over for speeding and the police smelled alcohol on his breath.  \nApplicant was tested for DUI and had a blood alcohol level of .09.  He was coming from \na friend\u2019s house where he had consumed between six and eight beers.  Applicant states \nthat because the police officer moved and could not testify in court the matter was \ndismissed on a technicality.  (Tr. p. 27.)  He admits that he was intoxicated at the time of \nthe arrest.  When Applicant was asked by the Department Counsel, why drink and still \nget behind the wheel?  Applicant responded that, \u201cJust \u2013 I just feel sometimes I gotta  -- \nI gotta go.  And I just - - and I just go.\u201d  (Tr. p. 27.)   \n \n \nApplicant testified that the last time he drank and got behind the wheel to drive \nwas within the last six months before the hearing.  (Tr. p. 29.)  Applicant states that he \ndoes not plan on ruling out his drinking in the future, but because there are other \noptions available such has Lyft service he plans to use that more to keep himself from \ndrinking and driving.  (Tr. p. 30.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable \nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to \naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;  \n \n \nApplicant has been arrested and charged on three separate occasions with DUI, \nand continues to drink and drive.  This evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifications. \n \nThe conditions set forth under AG \u00b6 32 could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not  cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse involving three arrests for DUI, and the fact \nthat he continues to drink and drive, the last time occurring just six months before the \nhearing, indicates that he does not show the required good judgment and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information.  Although \nhis DUI\u2019s occurred more than nine years ago, Applicant has continued to drink and drive \nand has simply been lucky not to have been arrested.  He has not produced sufficient \nevidence to establish that future criminal problems are unlikely. He has not established \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 32.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(b) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n  \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant incurred three arrests and charges for DUI.  \nThese incidents raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c).   \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern  of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear  and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nApplicant failed to introduce sufficient evidence of rehabilitation. Although it has \nnot been determined if he is an alcoholic or is alcohol dependent, he has had three \nalcohol-related incidents, two involving serious car accidents that he caused.  He \ncontinues to consumed alcohol to excess.  His conduct has been irresponsible and \ndangerous.  Following each DUI arrest, he has tried to stop drinking.  On each \noccasion, after a short period, he resumed his previous pattern of drinking.  Given the \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nextensive nature of his drinking problem, and the fact that he continues to drink and \ndrive, Applicant has not shown the requisite good judgment and reliability necessary to \naccess classified information.   \u00b6 32 does not provide mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant continues to consume \nalcohol to excess even after being arrested on three occasions for DUI.  At this time, \nthere is no strong evidence in the record to show that he will remain sober for any \nsustained period.  He has failed to present sufficient evidence of rehabilitation to \novercome his heavy burden to mitigate his alcohol abuse.  Overall, the record evidence \nraises doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from the \ncited adjudicative guidelines. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:    \n           Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:                       Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:                      Against Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Karoian, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 25 June 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant timely answered the\n2\nSOR, requesting a decision without hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA). The record in this case closed 3 February 2019, when Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the FORM was due. Applicant provided no additional documents. DOHA\nassigned the case to me 1 March 2019.\nConsisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-4.\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent\nDirective 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017. \n1\n03/08/2019\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied failing to timely file his state and Federal income tax returns as\nalleged in the SOR, but admitted owing the Internal Revenue Service over $58,000 for\neight delinquent tax years. He is a 50-year-old senior administrative associate employed\nby a U.S. defense contractor since January 2007. He has been employed in related\npositions with two other defense contractors since October 1993. He has previously had\nfavorable background investigations in September 1998 and April 2006. This appears to\nbe a periodic reinvestigation of that clearance (Item 1).\nApplicant disclosed his IRS tax debt for tax years 2006-2007 and 2009-2013 on\nhis January 2016 clearance application (Item 3), and discussed them at length during\nhis June 2017 interview with a Government investigator (Item 4). He stated that he\nreceived a notice(s) in January 2016 about the delinquent tax years, made one\ntelephone call to the IRS that went unanswered, and thereafter made no effort to\ncontact the IRS to arrange a payment schedule. He attributed his tax debt to his not\nadjusting his income tax withholding to reflect his income. However, he offered no\nexplanation for his failure to file his Federal tax returns on time. Applicant\u2019s IRS tax\ntranscripts for the years in question show that the IRS filed tax liens against Applicant in\nJuly 2017. Applicant\u2019s Answer admits the tax debt and states only, without\ncorroboration, that he was working with the IRS and his bank to pay the debt off.\nApplicant denied failing to timely file his 2005-2007, 2010-2013, and 2016-2017\nstate and Federal income tax returns (SOR 1.a-1.r). He admits owing the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) over $58,000 (SOR 1.s-1.aa, exclusive of 1.w\u2014not used).\nApplicant denied failing to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for nine\nyears. However, Applicant\u2019s IRS tax transcripts for 2005-2016 (Item 4) show that\nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for 2005-2006, 2010-2013,\nand 2016.  Record evidence does not confirm that Applicant failed to file his 2017\n3\nFederal income tax return (SOR 1.i) or his 2005-2007, 2010-2013, 2016-2017 state\nincome tax returns (SOR 1.j-1.r). Accordingly, I find those allegations for Applicant.\nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a\nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community\ninvolvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nIn fairness to Applicant, he filed for extensions for several years, and missed the extended filing deadlines\n3\nby only days or weeks\u2014compared to some years where he missed the filing deadlines by months or years.\nNevertheless, Applicant was assessed late filing fees and late payment fees.\n2\n\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his\nFederal income tax returns for eight of twelve years between 2005 and 2016. The IRS\nnotified Applicant that he had delinquent taxes in January 2016, but Applicant took no\nmeaningful action to address his taxes. The IRS filed tax liens for these tax years in July\n2017. Furthermore, Applicant documented no efforts to contact the IRS since his June\n2017 interview5\nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information.\nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal\nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good\njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access\nto classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously\nnoted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their\nlegal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a history\n5\nof not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required;\n3\n\nhave demonstrated the high degree of judgment and\nreliability required for access to classified information.\u201d6\nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful  or attributed to the press of other\n7\ncircumstances.  As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of\n8\nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal\nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal\nobligation. Applicant\u2019s . . . failure to have done so for many\nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling\nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that\ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A\nperson who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal\nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good\njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to\nclassified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant\nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183\n(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the\nJudge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 19(g) explicitly\nprovides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that\ncan raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive\npresumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct\nunder any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a\nclearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App.\nBd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd.\nDec. 9, 2015).\nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an\nApplicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case\nhis failure to timely file his Federal returns for at least eight years has created significant\ntax debt that he has not addressed.\n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His\nfailures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and the circumstances are\nnot demonstrated to be likely to recur.  Moreover, he has not demonstrated that his\n9\nISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd.

Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years).\nSee, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester).\n7\nSee, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file).\n8\n\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n9\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n4\n\nfailures to timely file and his subsequent failures to timely pay or make pay\narrangements were due to circumstances beyond his control, and it is clear that he has\nnot been responsible in addressing his taxes.10\n \nApplicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, and there are no clear\nindications that his tax debt is being resolved.  He has documented no contacts with\n11\nthe IRS, and consequently cannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to\nresolve his taxes.   Moreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which might\n12\nsupport a whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his\nconduct.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 15, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On August 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n03/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear as to when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the \ncase file. In a sworn statement, dated September 5, 2018, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 3, 2018, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on December 20, 2018. Applicant\u2019s response was due on January 19, 2019. \nApplicant apparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of February 27, 2019, he \nhad not done so. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted without comments all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.s.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a technician with his current employer (or subcontractor) since November 2016. A \n2005 high school graduate, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 2012, and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been \ngranted a security clearance. Applicant was married in 2012. He has no children. \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n \nDuring his enhanced subject interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) in September 2017, Applicant initially denied \nhaving any judgments filed against him or having any accounts sent to collections. Upon \nbeing confronted with certain contrary facts, he either acknowledged the status of certain \naccounts, disputed the status of some accounts, overlooked some accounts, or claimed \nhe did recall anything about other accounts. He subsequently attributed his financial \nissues to \u201cbouts of unemployment and low paying jobs, where [he] was unable to cover \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: Item 4 (e-QIP, dated June 15, 2017); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nSeptember 19, 2017); Item 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 22, \n2017); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 31, 2018).  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nall of his debt.\u201d2 But, he noted that in April 2017, he received a wage increase and that \nincrease would enable him to start paying off his delinquent debts.3 In his Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant added that the debt was accrued because he was forced to use credit \ncards and sustained his debt. \u201cUnfortunately this debt became too much and [he] was \nunable to pay any of it off.\u201d4 In his e-QIP, Applicant noted only one period of \nunemployment (November 2011 until September 2012) after he was let go by mutual \nagreement (actually fired) following notice of unsatisfactory performance. During that \nperiod, he was a student supported by his wife and unemployment compensation. \nAlthough he was not unemployed for any reported period thereafter, another employer \nreleased him for unsatisfactory performance because Applicant routinely failed to follow \nthe company\u2019s shift schedule and was repeatedly disciplined and counseled.5  \nThe SOR identified 19 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or filed as judgments, all generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s June 2017 or \nJanuary 2018 credit reports. Applicant acknowledged that he had made no effort to \nresolve the accounts, but stated that he planned to do so once the accounts with lower \nbalances are paid off.6 Those debts, totaling approximately $93,582, all of which were \nplaced for collection, are described below: \n (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) an unspecified type of account for $1,355 that was sold to a debt \npurchaser before becoming a judgment; (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) an unspecified type of account for \n$6,555 that was sold to a debt purchaser before being reduced to a judgment; (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c.) an unsecured guaranteed loan for $3,067 that was charged off; (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. through \n1.p.) education loans that fell into default and were returned to the U.S. Department of \nEducation in the amounts of $5,116; $4,032; $6,121; $3,965; $6,121; $376; $4,497; \n$3,164; $6,619; $4,266; $6,913; $8,924; and $9,278; (SOR \u00b6 1.q.) an unspecified type of \naccount for $11,621 that was charged off; (SOR \u00b6 1.r.) an unspecified type of account for \n$1,521 that went to judgment; and (SOR \u00b6 1.s.) an unspecified type of account for $71. \nApplicant failed to indicate his current monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt \npayments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary \nspending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling. There is no evidence that since his April 2017 pay increase he has made any \n                                                          \n2 Item 5, supra note 1, at 11. \n \n3 Item 5, supra note 1, at 6-11. \n \n4 Item 3 (Answer to the SOR, dated September 5, 2018). \n \n5 Item 5, supra note 1, at 5. \n6 Item 5, supra note 1. It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay \noff delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner \nand otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nefforts to contact his creditors, enter into repayment plans with any creditors, or make any \npayments to any creditors to resolve any of his delinquent or charged-off accounts, even \nto the one creditor to which he owes $71. While not alleged in the SOR, it is noted that \nApplicant also had an account with a jewelry company with a high credit of $4,500 that \nwent to judgment, but was eventually paid off in 2016.7 Other than his general statements \nabout his future intentions, Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial \nsituation has improved, or that it is now under control.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d8 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d9   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n                                                          \n7 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also \nISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. \nSept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged \ndelinquent accounts, as well as his lack of candor on his e-QIP, will be considered only for the five purposes \nlisted above.  \n \n8 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n9 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d10 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.11  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d12  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d13 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n10 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n11 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n12 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n13 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nThe SOR identified 19 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or filed as judgments, totaling $93,582. Those delinquent accounts all \ncontinue to be unaddressed and unresolved, despite Applicant being fully employed since \nNovember 2016 (and receiving a salary increase in April 2017). Applicant claimed that \nwhen he was unemployed in 2011-2012, he was unable to make his required monthly \npayments, but it appears that he was simply content to remain unemployed for a period \nof time sufficient for him to continue his education (by increasing the unpaid balance of \nhis student loans), and drawing unemployment benefits. Applicant\u2019s failure to even \naddress the one delinquent debt in the amount of $71 constitutes an unwillingness to \nsatisfy his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;14 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;15  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \n                                                          \n14 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n15 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nmake it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it \nis \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his one period of \nunemployment (November 2011 until September 2012), and insufficient funds to maintain \nhis financial responsibilities. There is no documentation to reflect that Applicant made any \nefforts, much less \u201cgood-faith\u201d efforts, before or after he was interviewed by OPM; before \nor after the SOR was issued in August 2018; or even after he was sent the FORM in \nDecember 2018, to: obtain financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source, \nsuch as a non-profit credit counseling service; dispute his delinquent accounts with the \ncredit reporting agencies or the creditors themselves; contact his creditors to set up \nrepayment plans; or indicate that payments had been made to his creditors.16  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests.17 In this instance, to date, there is no evidence that any \ncorrective actions have been taken by Applicant. There is no evidence to conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s finances are under control. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                          \n16 See ISCR Case No. 12-01335 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). \n \n17 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.18  \n  \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 32-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor, serving as a technician with his current employer \nor a subcontractor since November 2016. He had a non-SOR account with a jewelry \ncompany with a high credit of $4,500 that went to judgment, but was eventually paid off \nin 2016. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant exhibited a lack of candor when he completed his e-QIP and denied having any \nfinancial issues. He actually had 19 delinquent accounts that had been placed for \ncollection, charged off, or reduced to judgment totaling $93,582. Those delinquent \naccounts all continue to be unaddressed and unresolved by Applicant, despite his being \nfully employed since November 2016, and receiving a salary increase in April 2017. \nApplicant has made no efforts to resolve his delinquent debts despite promising to do so. \nApplicant has not obtained financial counseling. There is no evidence of a budget, and \nhe offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it is \nnow under control. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:19 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \n                                                          \n18 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n19 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor, if not non-existent, track record of \ndebt reduction and elimination efforts, seemingly avoiding all of the debts in his name. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.s.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Common access card \n(CAC) credentialing eligibility is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 17, 2017, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive \nPositions (SF 85). On July 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing eligibility concerns for CAC \ncredentialing pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive \u2013 12, Policy for a \nCommon Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, August 27, \n2004 (HSPD-12). DOD was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant CAC eligibility.  \n \nThis action is based on the Supplemental Adjudicative Standards (SAS) found in \nDOD Instruction (DODI) 5200.46, DOD Investigative and Adjudicative Guidance for \nIssuing the Common Access Card, dated September 9, 2014, and the procedures set \nforth in Enclosure (Encl.) 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The \nconcerns raised are \u201ccriminal or dishonest conduct,\u201d under DODI 5200.46 and in DODI \n5200.46, Appendix (App.) 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2.    \n \n\n \n2 \nOn August 10, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), dated August 24, 2018, was provided to her by letter on August 27, \n2018. Applicant received the FORM on September 5, 2018. She was afforded a period \nof 45 days to file objections and supply additional information for consideration. \nApplicant timely submitted a two-page response to the FORM. On December 20, 2018, \nthe case was assigned to me. Department Counsel submitted six documents with her \nFORM, marked as Items 1 through 6. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is marked Item \n7. Items 1 through 7 are admitted into evidence.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old mechanic employed at a military installation since \nAugust 2017. She has been steadily employed since at least 2012 holding multiple jobs. \nApplicant was awarded an associate in applied science degree in avionics technology in \nMay 2015. She also holds an active medical certificate third class and student pilot \ncertificate.  \n \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct \nCAC eligibility concerns were identified as a result of Applicant\u2019s five arrests \ninvolving physical altercations. In her SOR Answer, Applicant admits each of the \nallegations. These allegations are further established by the evidence contained in the \nFORM. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e; Items 1 - 6) \n \nA summary of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct follows: (1) in March 2011 (age 21), \narrested and charged with assault-domestic violence 3rd. Charge dismissed; (2) in \nNovember 2011 (age 21), arrested and charged with harassment. Charge dismissed; \n(3) in December 2011 (age 21), arrested and charged with simple assault, harassment, \nand domestic violence. Pled guilty to disorderly conduct and sentenced to six months of \nconfinement (suspended), ordered to pay court costs and fines, and complete two years \nof unsupervised probation; (4) in September 2012 (age 21), arrested and charged with \ndisorderly conduct and harassment after bench warrant had been issued. Charge \ndismissed; (5) in March 2015 (age 24), arrested and charged with assault 3rd, \nobstruction of government operation, and disorderly conduct. Pled guilty to charges and \nsentenced to six months of confinement (suspended), ordered to pay court costs and \nfines, and complete two years of unsupervised probation. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e; Items 1 - \n6) \n \nIn 2017, Applicant completed anger management \u2013 domestic violence group \ncounseling following her March 2015 arrest. She is in a stable relationship, has not been \ninvolved in further criminal conduct, and no longer associates with individuals involved \nin her past criminal conduct. (Item 2) Applicant has no record of disciplinary actions in \nher employee file, has received favorable performance evaluations, and was awarded \nher associate\u2019s degree. Lastly, and on her own initiative, she completed the \nrequirements to receive a medical certificate third class and student pilot certificate to \nfurther assist pilots in flight. Applicant requested to maintain her CAC eligibility to \n\n \n3 \ncontinue providing \u201cexcellent aircraft maintenance for the men and women\u201d on her \nmilitary installation. (Item 2) Post-FORM, Applicant submitted a comprehensive \nattendance log documenting her anger management - domestic violence counseling \nsessions completed in 2017. (Item 7) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nissues raised are listed in DODI 5200.46, Encl. 4, App. 1, Basic Adjudicative Standards, \nand App. 2, SAS. The overriding factor for all of these conditions is unacceptable risk. \nThe decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant of CAC eligibility \nis clearly consistent with the national interest.    \n \nThe objective of the CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. Each case must be judged on its own merits, \ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, \nmature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility. In all \nadjudications, the protection of the national interest is the paramount consideration. \nTherefore, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for CAC eligibility should \nbe resolved in favor of the national interest.  \n \nAnalysis \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct  \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 2 describes the concern: \n \n2. A CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s criminal or dishonest conduct, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \na. An individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment . . . , or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout his or her reliability or trustworthiness and may put people, property, \nor information systems at risk. An individual\u2019s past criminal or dishonest \nconduct may put people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 2 indicates conditions that may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n\n \n4 \n \nb. Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include: \n \n(1) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses which put the safety \nof people at risk or threaten the protections of property or information. . . . ; \n \n(2) Charges or admissions of criminal conduct relating to the safety of \npeople and proper protection of property or information systems, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n(5) Actions involving violence . . . of a criminal nature that poses an \nunacceptable risk if access is granted to federally-controlled facilities and \nfederally-controlled information systems.   \n \n \nBased on the evidence contained in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s criminal or \ndishonest conduct, SAS \u00b6\u00b6 2.b (1), (2), and (5) are applicable. Further review is \nnecessary. \n \n \nSAS \u00b6\u00b6 2.c lists three circumstances relevant to the determination of whether \nthere is a reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk: \n \n(1) The behavior happened so long ago, was minor in nature, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \n \n(2) Charges were dismissed or evidence was provided that the person did \nnot commit the offense and details and reasons support his or her \ninnocence; and \n \n(4) Evidence has been supplied of successful rehabilitation, including but \nnot limited to remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, constructive community involvement, or passage of \ntime without recurrence. \n \n \nThe record supports full application of SAS \u00b6\u00b6 2.c (1), (2), and (4). Four of \nApplicant\u2019s arrests occurred when she was 21 years old, and her last arrest in 2015 \noccurred when she was 24 years old. The charges following three of her arrests were \ndismissed. Her two convictions were pursuant to her pleading guilty. Applicant has \naccepted responsibility for her actions and has not attempted to minimize her culpability. \n \n \nApplicant has made a concerted effort to make positive changes in her life and \nrefrain from criminal conduct since her last arrest in March 2015. She was awarded her \nassociate\u2019s degree in May 2015, obtained an active medical certificate third class and \nstudent pilot certificate, and has avoided any further criminal conduct. She is no longer \non probation and completed all of her court-ordered counseling requirements in 2017. \nSince starting her current job in August 2015, Applicant has received favorable \nperformance evaluations and has no record of disciplinary actions in her employee file. \nCriminal or dishonest conduct concerns are mitigated. \n\n \n5 \nWhole-Person Assessment \n  \n \nDODI 5200.46, Encl. 4, CAC Adjudicative Procedures, \u00b6 1, Guidance For \nApplying Credentialing Standards During Adjudication provides the following mitigating \nfactors: \n \nAs established in [HSPD-12], credentialing adjudication considers whether \nor not an individual is eligible for long-term access to federally controlled \nfacilities and/or information systems. The ultimate determination to \nauthorize, deny, or revoke the CAC based on a credentialing \ndetermination of the PSI must be made after consideration of applicable \ncredentialing standards in [U.S. Office of Personnel Management \nMemorandum, Final Credentialing Standards for Issuing Personal Identity \nVerification Cards Under HSPD-12, July 31, 2008].  \n \nb. Each case is unique. Adjudicators must examine conditions that raise \nan adjudicative concern, the overriding factor for all of these conditions is \nunacceptable risk. Factors to be applied consistently to all information \navailable to the adjudicator are: \n \n \n(1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct. The more serious the \nconduct, the greater the potential for an adverse CAC determination. \n \n \n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Sufficient information \nconcerning the circumstances of the conduct must be obtained to \ndetermine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the conduct \nposes a risk to people, property, or information systems. \n \n \n(3) The recency and frequency of the conduct. More recent or more \nfrequent conduct is of greater concern.  \n \n \n(4) The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct. \nOffenses committed as a minor are usually treated as less serious than \nthe same offenses committed as an adult, unless the offense is very \nrecent, part of a pattern, or particularly heinous. \n \n \n(5) Contributing external conditions. Economic and cultural conditions \nmay be relevant to the determination of whether there is a reasonable \nbasis to believe there is an unacceptable risk if the conditions are currently \nremoved or countered (generally considered in cases with relatively minor \nissues). \n \n \n(6) The absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation, if \nrelevant, to address conduct adverse to CAC determinations. \n \n \n(a) Clear, affirmative evidence of rehabilitation is required for a \nfavorable adjudication (e.g., seeking assistance and following professional \n\n \n6 \nguidance, where appropriate; demonstrating positive changes in behavior \nand employment). \n \n \n \n(b) Rehabilitation may be a consideration for most conduct, not just \nalcohol and drug abuse. While formal counseling or treatment may be a \nconsideration, other factors (such as the individual\u2019s employment record) \nmay also be indications of rehabilitation. \n \n  \nMy comments under the criminal or dishonest conduct analysis are incorporated \ninto this whole-person assessment. Applicant is a 28-year-old mechanic and has been \nemployed at a military installation for almost two years. She is making a contribution \ntowards the national defense. Her arrests occurred when she was relatively young. The \nevidence suggests that Applicant has come to grips with the fact that her past conduct \nis unacceptable, and she has successfully avoided engaging in any further criminal \nconduct. \n \n \n \nI have carefully considered the facts of this case and applied the standards in \nDODI 5200.46. For reasons discussed above, Applicant\u2019s request for CAC eligibility is \ngranted.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Encl. 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal or Dishonest \n    Conduct:  \n \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant CAC eligibility.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual allegations in the SOR pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). She failed to address the factual allegations pertaining to the criminal conduct issues. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a systems administrator with her current employer since January 2016. A 2009 high school graduate, Applicant earned a number of college credits, but no degree. She enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in September 2009, and served on active duty until September 2013, when she was honorably discharged. She completed her military service commitment in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) in August 2017. She was granted a secret clearance in November 2010.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 17, 2013, and again on December 14, 2016, Applicant applied for \na security clearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) versions of a Security Clearance Application. On an unspecified date \nin 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of \ninterrogatories. She responded to those interrogatories on February 20, 2018. On May \n17, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), (December 10, 2016), National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \n  12/13/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017.  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) \nand J (Criminal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 4, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated June \n13, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have her case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on September 11, 2018, and she was \nafforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on September 18, 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s response was due on November 2, 2018. Applicant timely submitted one \ndocument in response to the FORM, and it was admitted as an Applicant exhibit, without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). She \nfailed to address the factual allegations pertaining to the criminal conduct issues. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a systems administrator with her current employer since January 2016. A 2009 high \nschool graduate, Applicant earned a number of college credits, but no degree. She \nenlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in September 2009, and served on active duty \nuntil September 2013, when she was honorably discharged. She completed her military \nservice commitment in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) in August 2017. She was \ngranted a secret clearance in November 2010. Applicant was married in December 2013, \nand separated in May 2016. She has two sons, born in October 2012, and sometime in \n2018. \n \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \n \nApplicant is an alcohol abuser whose consumption of alcohol has led to at least \nthree incidents over a five-year period that resulted in actions taken by police and court \nauthorities:  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n\u2022In November 2011, when she was on active duty, after being out drinking an \nunspecified quantity of beer at a bar with friends, Applicant drove onto her military facility \nwhile under the influence of alcohol and emitting the odor of alcohol, and she was \napprehended at the gate by the military police. She was administered a breathalyzer and \nfield-sobriety test. In December 2011, the traffic court on base assessed her 10 points to \nher driving record on base, and she was ordered to attend a one-day alcohol education \nprogram. She was eventually administratively counseled by her command with a write-up \nunder what is called a page 11 entry, declared ineligible for promotion for three months, \nand issued a reprimand.1 \n \n\u2022In March 2012, when she was on active duty, after being out drinking one shot of \nliquor, a mixed drink, and up to two beers at a bar with her sister, she decided to return \nto the military facility by taxi. While riding in the taxi, she passed out. The gate guards \ncould not awaken her, so she was transported to the base hospital. She was subsequently \nordered to undergo an alcohol screening. Based on the alcohol screening, Applicant was \nadvised to participate in outpatient treatment, but because she was pregnant, she \nrequested inpatient treatment. She was in the hospital treatment program from March 27, \n2012, until April 24, 2012, during which she participated in group counseling, was given \na smokers patch, and administered Melatonin to treat insomnia. No diagnosis was \nreported. She purportedly successfully completed the program \u201cby mutual decision,\u201d and \nwas discharged. The U.S. Navy medical office guided her through an outpatient follow-\nup from May 2012 until August 2012, during which she participated in individual therapy \nand individual therapy. There was no diagnosis. She purportedly successfully completed \nthat program \u201cby mutual decision,\u201d and was discharged.2 \n \n\u2022On July 2, 2016, at about 1 a.m., after being out drinking two beers and what she \ndescribed as a \u201ctrashcan\u201d3 at a caf\u00e9 with a friend, blaming the anniversary of her father\u2019s \npassing and the absence of her husband for her frame of mind, Applicant drove to her \nresidence. On the way there, Applicant\u2019s vehicle struck a tow truck stopped at a traffic \nsignal in a traffic lane, sideswiping it coming from the opposite direction. As a result of the \nimpact, a trail of debris, including the front left tire, most of the front bumper, and the \nlicense plate were left behind. Applicant drove away without exchanging any information \nwith the tow truck driver. He followed her at a fast rate of speed and called the police. The \npolice arrived just as Applicant and her companion were attempting to enter her house. \nHer damaged vehicle was out front. Applicant was questioned and acknowledged that \nshe had been drinking, and that she fled because she was scared. There was a strong \nodor of alcohol coming from her breath and person. She was administered field sobriety \n                                                          \n1 Item 5 (Personal Subject Interview, dated January 3, 2014), at 3, 5; Item 5 (Personal Subject \nInterview, dated August 1, 2017), at 5; Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated June 13, 2018), at 1. \n \n2 Item 5 (January 2014 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5-6; Item 5 (August 2017 \nPersonal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. It should be noted that although the medical records were \nrequested from the hospital, and Applicant authorized the release of those records, there are no such \nmedical or treatment records in the case file, and the specifics of the treatment remain unreported. \n \n3 The ingredients of a typical trashcan drink are: 1/2 ounce gin, 1/2 ounce vodka, 1/2 ounce triple \nsec, 1/2 ounce light rum, 1/2 ounce peach schnapps, 1/2 ounce blue curacao, and 1 full can Red Bull. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \ntests and arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). She was later \nadministered an intoxilizer test. Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated \n(DWI), first offense, with a blood alcohol reading of between .15 and .20 percent, a \nmisdemeanor; and failing to stop at an accident, a misdemeanor. On September 15, \n2016, she was found guilty of the DWI, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, 85 days of \nwhich were suspended, ordered to attend an area alcohol safety program (ASAP), placed \non unsupervised probation for three years, fined, her operator\u2019s license was restricted, \nand an ignition interlock restriction was required. The remaining charge was dismissed \nnolle prosequi.4  \n \nApplicant claimed that she enrolled in the ASAP and attended weekly group \ntherapy meetings for 16 weeks, as well as a 4-week program, not otherwise described, \nending in March 2017. She also contends that she voluntarily attends Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings when she feels the need to do so.5  \n \nIn January 2014, Applicant acknowledged to an investigator from the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) that she began consuming alcohol when she was \napproximately 18 years of age while attending high school parties. There were times \nwhen she would drink two to three beers on three or four occasions per week, and periods \nwhen she did not drink at all. Describing intoxication as being \u201cfuzzy headed\u201d and slurring \nwords, she acknowledged becoming intoxicated after consuming seven or eight beers, \nsomething she did weekly on average. She also acknowledged that she has become \nintoxicated after only three beers. Applicant drinks sometimes to deal with stress, and \nsometimes just to be social.6 In August 2017, she claimed to another OPM investigator \nthat she had no future intent to consume alcohol nor would she ever operate a vehicle \nwhile intoxicated. She denied that her drinking and driving incidents constituted a pattern, \nand contended that her 2016 incident was an \u201cisolated\u201d incident.7 In her Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant claims that she has attempted to turn her life around by avoiding being in \nsituations where alcohol is involved, by changing the friends with whom she associates, \nand by no longer drinking.8 In her Response to the FORM, Applicant reiterated her \nposition regarding alcohol. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n                                                          \n4 Item 5 (August 2017 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 3-5; Item 6 (Sheriff\u2019s Incident \nReport, dated July 2, 2016); Item 7 (Court Traffic/Criminal Case Details, dated September 15, 2016). \n \n5 Item 5 (August 2017 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. \n \n6 Item 5 (January 2014 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 6. \n \n7 Item 5 (August 2017 Personal Subject Interview), supra note 1, at 5. \n \n8 Item 2, supra note 1, at 1-2. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d9 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d10   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d11 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.12  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \n                                                          \n9 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n10 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n11 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n12 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d13  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d14 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set forth \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n                                                          \n13 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n14 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication on \nat least three occasions during the period November 2011 until July 2016, and that use \nof alcohol has led to a number of incidents that resulted in actions taken by police and \ncourt authorities. As a result of her alcohol consumption, she has been administratively \nreprimanded while in the USMC and convicted of DWI after her vehicle struck another \nvehicle and she drove away without exchanging any information. She has been ordered \nto attend a one-day alcohol education program, directed to participate in a hospital \nrehabilitation program, an outpatient aftercare program, and ASAP. While her \nconsumption of alcohol appears to be repetitive in nature, there is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that such consumption constituted binge drinking status. Appellant purportedly \nsuccessfully completed the command-mandated and court-ordered programs and the \nrequirements of those programs. AG \u00b6 22(a) has been established, but none of the other \nconditions have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes several examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that \ncould mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) partially applies, but none of the remaining conditions apply. Because \nof its relative recency, Applicant\u2019s 2016 alcohol-related incident \u2013 the one involving a DWI \nand a hit and run \u2013 is the most significant, as far as her security clearance review is \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nconcerned. Applicant\u2019s behavior, stemming from her association with alcohol, has not \nbeen infrequent, and the circumstances developed do not appear to be unusual. She had \nadmitted to repeated periods of intoxication over the years. While Applicant now \nacknowledges her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, for far too long she seemingly gave \nlip-service to it. She abstained briefly at times, but eventually returned to excessive \nalcohol use. She continued to abstain for longer periods when required to do so, like \nduring periods of treatment, but relapses continued to occur. Moreover, it is troubling that \nfor her most recent incident, Applicant seems to blame the anniversary of her father\u2019s \npassing and the absence of her husband for her DWI and hit and run incident. While \nApplicant now claims to be abstinent, she has failed to demonstrate a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence. Even crediting her with her \npurported period of abstinence, which would be since July 2016, that period equates to \nonly two and one-half years, after nearly a decade of alcohol consumption and abuse.  \n \nApplicant successfully completed the series of alcohol-related programs that were \neither command-mandated or court-mandated. Despite her acknowledgement that AA is \na good program for her, she only attends meetings on an irregular basis, when she thinks \nshe needs to do so. Because of her history of maladaptive alcohol use, her relatively brief \nunsubstantiated period of abstinence, and her irregular attendance at AA, there remain \nsignificant questions as to whether such maladaptive alcohol use will recur. Nevertheless, \nApplicant should be encouraged to remain abstinent for a much longer period. She has \nfailed to demonstrate a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence, and under the circumstances, there remain doubts on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes three conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and  \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s Alcohol Consumption is adopted herein. In \naddition, Applicant\u2019s court-mandated probation \u2013 a result of her July 2016 arrest and \nSeptember 2016 DWI conviction \u2013 is still in place, and does not expire until mid or late \n2019. Accordingly, based on the actions described above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c) \nhave been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) partially applies. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. Applicant has a multiple-\nincident history of criminal conduct, commencing in November 2011 and continuing \nperiodically until at least July 2016. She was arrested, and charged with a variety of \ncrimes, been reprimanded, spent time in jail, was fined, placed on probation, lost her \ndriver\u2019s license, and required to attend several treatment and educational programs. Over \nthat period, nothing seemed to work. She continued to blame a variety of situations or \nindividuals for her criminal involvement. There is limited unverified evidence of the \nsuccessful completion of various command-mandated or court-mandated programs.  \n \nWhile there is evidence that one particular charge was dismissed or otherwise not \nprosecuted, that dismissal and non-prosecution does not, without substantially more, \nnecessarily reflect that Applicant did not commit the individual offense charged. \nGenerally, the passage of time without recurrence of additional criminal activity can be \nconstrued as some evidence of successful rehabilitation. However, in this instance, the \nmost recent criminal activity was committed two and one-half years ago. While a person \nshould not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, in this instance the \npast is relatively recent, and the concerns about future criminal conduct are continuing. \nApplicant\u2019s past history of criminal conduct, under the circumstances, continues to cast \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.15  \n  \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 28-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a systems administrator \nwith her current employer since January 2016. She enlisted in the USMC in September \n2009, and served on active duty until September 2013, when she was honorably \ndischarged. She completed her military service commitment in the IRR in August 2017. \nShe was granted a secret clearance in November 2010. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant has consumed alcohol to intoxication on various occasions. She consumed \nalcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication on at least three occasions \nduring the period November 2011 until July 2016, and that use of alcohol has led to a \nnumber of incidents that resulted in actions taken by police and court authorities. As a \nresult of her alcohol consumption, she has been administratively reprimanded while in the \nUSMC and convicted of DWI after her vehicle struck another vehicle and she drove away \nwithout exchanging any information. She has been sentenced to jail, ordered to attend \nvarious alcohol-related programs, placed on unsupervised probation for three years, \nfined, her operator\u2019s license was restricted. She remains on probation. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct concerns.

He did not mitigate the resulting financial security concerns. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 8, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. Applicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on July 18, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nOn October 3, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me. On October 18, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting \nthe case for November 7, 2018. The case was heard as scheduled. Department Counsel \noffered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence. Applicant testified. He did \nnot offer any exhibits or object to the Government Exhibits, and all exhibits were admitted. \n01/31/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 16, 2018. The record remained \nopen until December 17, 2018, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit evidence. He \ntimely submitted an email that contained relevant information and one exhibit pertinent to \na state tax issue. I marked the email as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and the document as AE \nB. Department Counsel had no objections to the exhibits and they are admitted into \nevidence. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the seven allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated into these findings.  \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and divorced since 2009. His seven-year-old son from \nthat marriage lives in another state with his mother. Applicant pays child support for his \nson. Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree and is working on a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. \n17-19)  \n \n \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant enlisted in the Army in 1999. He \nserved on active duty for six years. He received an honorable discharge, as a sergeant, \nE-5. While serving, he deployed to the Middle East for a year and served in a combat unit. \n(Tr. 19-22; GE 1) He has worked for defense contractors since 2005. In 2016, he started \na position working as an independent contractor for another Federal agency. (Tr. 22, 32; \nGE 1) He was also a partner in a small company from 2010 until 2015. (Tr. 26, 31)   \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to timely file Federal income and state tax returns \nand pay Federal taxes. (Tr. 28) He said the tax problems began with his 2010 Federal tax \nreturn. He thought the company for whom he worked handled his taxes and filings. He \nlearned in 2011 or 2012 that his 2010 taxes remained unfiled and he owed about $59,000 \nin unpaid income taxes. He then hired an outside company to file his tax returns for that \nyear. That company failed to perform and he subsequently hired a second company to \nresolve the 2010 tax issues. (Tr. 34-37)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his tax problems have been ongoing since tax year \n2010. (Tr. 28) He testified that he had not filed his Federal tax returns for 2010, 2011, \n2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. He said he did not know what to do after he learned that the \n2010 return was not filed. He admitted that he should have been more proactive in \naddressing the tax issues. (Tr. 46-49, 73)  \n \n \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s testimony, transcripts from the IRS, dated May 2018, \nindicate that those six years\u2019 returns were filed, albeit not all of them were filed timely. \n(GE 2) The transcripts reported:  \n \n1. Applicant\u2019s 2010 return was filed in March 2014. His adjusted gross income \n(AGI) was $141,666. He had an account balance of $59,750 in unpaid taxes \nfor this year; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n2. Applicant\u2019s 2011 return was filed in November 2012. His AGI was $136,244. \nHe had an account balance of $52,962 in unpaid taxes for this year; \n \n3. Applicant\u2019s 2012 return was filed in November 2013. His AGI was $174,783. \nHe had an account balance of $74,920 unpaid in taxes for this year; \n \n4. Applicant\u2019s 2013 return was filed in March 2016. His AGI was $193,039. He \nhad an account balance of $104,098 in unpaid taxes for this year;  \n \n5. Applicant\u2019s 2014 return was filed in March 2016. His AGI was $241,567. He \nhad an account balance of $107,837 in unpaid taxes for this year:  \n \n6. Applicant\u2019s 2015 return was timely filed in April 2016. His AGI was $232,239. \nHe owed $8,463 in unpaid taxes for this year;1 and \n \n7. Applicant\u2019s 2016 return was filed in May 2017. His AGI was $85,143. He did \nnot owe taxes for this year.2 \n \n           According to the May 2018 IRS transcripts, Applicant owed $406,030 in unpaid \ntaxes for the above years. (GE 2) His post-hearing submission indicated that on August \n25, 2018, he paid the IRS $8,456 to resolve his 2015 tax debt. (AE A)  \n \n         In response to a question about the discrepancy between his testimony that he had \nnot filed tax returns for years 2010 through 2015, and the IRS\u2019s records indicating that he \nhad filed them, Applicant said he \u201cmight have [filed]\u201d but could not remember. (Tr. 53, 79-\n80) In a post-hearing submission, he stated the second company he hired to handle his \ntax returns filed the above-mentioned returns. (AE A)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he owed about $40,000 for his 2017 Federal taxes.3 To date \nhe has paid about $16,000 toward the 2017 tax debt (Tr. 48, 53, 62) He acknowledged \nthat he did not make estimated quarterly tax payments in 2017 or for other years when \nhe was an independent contractor. (Tr. 63, 73) \n \n \nApplicant has filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2017. \n(Tr. 54) As of December 14, 2018, he resolved a $57,791 tax debt he owed the state for \ndelinquent tax debts through a two-year payment plan. (Tr. 55-56; GE 3; AE B) \n \n                                            \n1 Applicant was a W-2 employee during 2015 and his taxes were deducted from his salary and paid by his \nemployer. \n \n2 Applicant was a W-2 employee during 2016 and his taxes were deducted from his salary and paid by his \nemployer. \n \n3 The SOR does not allege a security concern related to Applicant\u2019s unpaid 2017 Federal tax debt. Hence, \nit will not be discussed in analyzing disqualifying conditions. It may be considered in the analysis of \nmitigating conditions and the whole-person concept, and in an evaluation of Applicant\u2019s credibility.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nIn 2013 or 2014, Applicant contacted the IRS to establish a payment plan for \nunpaid taxes for previous years, but he never entered into one. (Tr. 43) In December \n2018, he paid his 2015 Federal tax debt, but has not established a payment plan for tax \nyears 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. His large unpaid Federal income tax debt \nremains unresolved. He admitted that he has been neglectful. (Tr. 75) \n \n \nApplicant earns $140,000 annually from his current employer. He is an \nindependent contractor and is responsible for tax planning for the year. He said he puts \nabout 30% of his monthly income aside for taxes. (Tr. 56-57)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to file Federal income tax returns for tax years \n2010, 2013, and 2014, despite being aware of his duty to do so. He failed to timely file \nstate income tax returns for 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014. He also failed to timely pay \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nFederal income taxes for years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, despite earning \na significant salary those years. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate those \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s Federal income tax returns for 2010 to 2017 have been filed. His state \nincome tax returns for 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014 have also been filed and all \noutstanding state taxes have been resolved. Applicant continues to owe the IRS about \n$380,000 for unpaid Federal taxes for years 2010 through 2014 and 2017. His failure to \ntimely file income tax returns for several years and pay outstanding taxes continues to \ncast doubt on his judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant did not provide a \ncredible explanation for failing to timely file three years of Federal tax returns and four \nyears of state tax returns. He admitted that he had no valid reason for not responsibly \nmanaging and paying his taxes. His tax problems were within his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does \nnot apply. \n \n Applicant has not participated in credit or financial counseling, and there is no \nevidence that his unpaid tax debt for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 is paid, being \npaid, resolved, or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He has not initiated a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his outstanding Federal tax debt for those five tax years. AG \u00b6 20(d) \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ndoes not apply. He recently resolved his 2015 Federal tax debt through a payment plan. \nHe established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g) as to the 2015 debt.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent 38-year-old man, who honorably served in the Army for \nmore than six years. Since 2005, he has worked for different defense contractors and \ncurrently he works for another Federal agency.  \n \nDuring his hearing, Applicant discussed his history of unfiled Federal and state \nincome tax returns and unpaid taxes, although he was unable to provide accurate \ninformation about the status of his tax filings. He has resolved all alleged state income \ntax filings and payment issues. His Federal income tax returns from 2010 to 2017 are \nnow filed and he has paid his 2015 Federal tax debt. However, he has a large unpaid \nFederal tax debt that accumulated because he did not pay estimated taxes for several \nyears, despite earning a high salary. He recognized his responsibility to resolve that tax \ndebt, but has taken minimal action to do so. Applicant has not established a plan to pay \nthat debt nor has he established a record of responsibly following tax laws and managing \nrelated financial obligations. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \n\n \n \n \n \n8\ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).4  \n   \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \n    \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n        Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h:  \n \n        For Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n                                            \n4 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \nreceived the FORM on April 27, 2018. Applicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on July 26, 2018. The Government\u2019s documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 5 are admitted in evidence without objection. Other than \nhis Answer to the SOR, admitted into evidence as Item 2, Applicant failed to submit any \nadditional documentation. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 27 years old. He obtained a \nhigh-school diploma in 2009, and he attended some college from 2011 to 2012 but did \nnot earn a degree. He has worked as a material handler for a defense contractor since \nAugust 2016. He previously worked for another defense contractor from March 2015 to \nAugust 2016. He has never held a DOD security clearance. As of his August 2016 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), he had never been married and did not have any \nchildren.1   \n \n \nApplicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of \nintoxication, since after he graduated from high school. When he was underage, he \ntypically drank two to four beers once to twice monthly at house parties. Between ages \n21 to 24, he drank around two to eight beers almost nightly while socializing with \nfriends. From ages 24 to 26, he decreased his alcohol consumption because he tried to \nbecome more responsible. He did not like the person he had become after receiving his \nsecond driving under the influence (DUI) charge in March 2015, as discussed below. He \nno longer enjoyed feeling hung over. As of his 2017 background interview, he \nconsumed five to six beers on the weekends while socializing with friends.2  \n \n \nIn March 2012, at age 20, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was \nat a party with a friend and he drank five to six beers. He thought he was in good \ncondition to drive, but he wrecked his car in a ditch on his way home. He failed a field \nsobriety test. He pled guilty and was sentenced to probation and fined. He was ordered \nto participate in an alcohol assessment, attend a victim impact panel, and enroll in an \nalcohol and drug substance abuse course. He completed the alcohol classes in \nSeptember 2012, and he was on probation from around August 2012 to June 2013. A \ncourt record corroborates Applicant\u2019s indication in his SCA and background interview \nthat this DUI was dismissed in around January 2013.3   \n \n \nIn February 2015, Applicant was terminated from employment due to multiple \nlate arrivals and absences. He indicated in his background interview that he likely had a \nweek\u2019s worth of late arrivals and three to four absences in the last several months of his \n                                                          \n1 Items 1-4.  \n \n2 Item 4. \n \n3 Items 1-5.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nemployment. He was late and absent because he partied and drank with friends at bars, \nwas hungover, tired, and did not feel like working.4 \n \n \nIn March 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and speeding. He \nwas at a restaurant with a friend. Over the course of six to seven hours, he drank at \nleast 12 beers. As he was driving, he was stopped by a police officer for speeding. He \nfailed a field sobriety test. The speeding charge was dismissed. He pled guilty to DUI \nand was sentenced to jail for one year, suspended; probation for one year; license \nsuspension; and fined. He was again ordered to participate in an alcohol assessment, \nattend a victim impact panel, and enroll in an alcohol and drug substance abuse course. \nHe was also ordered to complete 80 hours of community service. He was on probation \nfrom September 2015 to June 2016, and he completed the court\u2019s requirements.5 \n \n \nIn November 2015, Applicant received a written warning from his employer. The \nwarning was for his failure to call or show for work. The previous evening, he was out \ndrinking and watching football with a friend. He overslept.6 \n \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication \nand resisting an officer. He and a friend were celebrating a holiday weekend at a bar, \nand he drank eight to nine beers and two shots of hard liquor. He walked back to his \napartment, which was around one mile from the bar, when he was arrested in his \napartment complex parking lot. He was difficult with the arresting officer because he \nwas drunk and upset. He pled no contest and was fined.7  \n \n \nIn his 2017 background interview, Applicant indicated that such alcohol-related \nincidents were unlikely to recur because he was a changed person. He indicated that he \nstopped drinking during the week and on Sundays because it interfered with work and \nhe did not like the person he was. He indicated that his family and friends are aware of \nhis alcohol-related incidents. He also indicated that he has never received an alcohol-\nrelated diagnosis.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n4 Items 1-4. \n \n5 Items 1-5. \n \n6 Items 1-4. \n \n7 Items 1, 2, 4. \n \n8 Item 4. \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the welfare \nand safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents away from work and at work. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), and 22(c) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following relevant conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents did not happen under unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. His \ntermination from one employer and warning from another in 2015 due to his alcohol-\nrelated conduct, his 2015 DUI conviction, and his 2017 public intoxication conviction are \nrecent and not mitigated by the passage of time. While he indicated that he has \nchanged his alcohol consumption, he has not yet demonstrated a clear pattern of \nmodified consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in this whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant responded to the SOR on March 9, 2018, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on July 26, 2018. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 1, 2018. She \nresponded to the FORM with documents that I have marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \n03/18/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nthrough F.1 The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2018. The Government \nexhibits included in the FORM and AE A through F are admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \n \nOn January 28, 2019, I notified Applicant that I would reopen the record if she \nwanted to submit additional documentary evidence. I reopened the record upon her \nrequest. She submitted documents that I have marked AE G through J and admitted \nwithout objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since 2017. She attended college for a period, but she has not \nearned a degree. She is the single mother of two minor children.2 \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which are attributed primarily to \nunemployment, underemployment, her children\u2019s significant medical problems, and the \ncosts associated with being a single mother of two children without meaningful support \nfrom the children\u2019s father. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2005, and her debts \nwere discharged in 2006.3  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 41 delinquent debts, including 28 medical debts and 13 \nmiscellaneous debts. However, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.v; 1.c and 1.p; \nand 1.d, 1.t, and 1.u are duplicate accounts. There are 27 non-duplicate medical debts \nand 10 non-duplicate miscellaneous debts. The debts are listed on a February 2016 \ncredit report, an October 2017 credit report, or both credit reports.4 \n \n \nThe ten non-duplicate miscellaneous debts total about $4,350 and include debts \nto telecommunications companies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-$1,058; 1.d-$435; and 1.bb-$371); \nbanks (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-$694; and 1.f-$366); a public utility (SOR \u00b6 1.i-$938); a returned \ncheck (SOR \u00b6 1.hh-$60); a toll bridge (SOR \u00b6 1.oo-$54); and two retail accounts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.cc-$165; and 1.gg-$212). \n \n \nApplicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in January 2018. She \nenrolled four debts totaling $6,675 in the company\u2019s debt-settlement program (DSP), \nincluding the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The three additional debts are owed to two \nfinancial institutions ($2,075 and $1,200) and a hospital ($2,500). It is difficult to ascribe \nthe three debts to any of the debts alleged in the SOR, although the hospital debt could \n                                                          \n1 AE F is a copy of the Government\u2019s FORM. \n \n2 Items 4, 5; AE A. \n \n3 Items 2, 5, 8, 9; AE A, C. \n \n4 Items 6, 7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nbe connected to one or more SOR debts. The DSP documentation called for Applicant \nto pay $252 per month for 18 months, plus $59 per month in fees.5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the non-duplicate miscellaneous debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.bb. She wrote in her response to the SOR for all four debts: \u201cI \nhave made payment arrangements with a debt consolidation company.\u201d She wrote In \nher response to the FORM: \n \nI finally landed a full time position last year. Since working full time I was \nable to move into my own apartment. I have been trying desperately to \npay off my debts and maintain a household for me and my children. Many \nof the debt[s] in question ha[ve] already been paid. Some of which are no \nlonger on my credit reports. I also contacted a debt consolidation company \nto work out a payment plan. . . . I will continue to work on paying off all of \nmy debt as quickly as possible. \n \n \nApplicant provided credit reports with her response to the SOR and FORM, but \nno actual proof of payments. I reopened the record for her to submit additional \ndocumentation. She responded that she was no longer working with the debt-settlement \ncompany because it was too much money. On January 29, 2019, she retained a law \nfirm to repair her credit and dispute inaccurate items on her credit report. She stated \nthat she is paying the law firm $109 per month. She also documented that on February \n27, 2019, she paid the $435 debt to the telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.d).6 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the $938 public utilities debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but \nshe wrote that she was \u201ccurrently making payments to [the utility company] on this \naccount.\u201d The debt was reported by Experian on the February 2016 combined credit \nreport, but it is not listed on the February 2018 Experian credit report.7 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the non-duplicate miscellaneous debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.cc, 1.gg, 1.hh, and 1.oo. She stated that she was unaware of the $165 debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.cc. The debt was reported by Equifax on the February 2016 combined credit \nreport, but it is not listed on the October 2017 Equifax credit report, nor any other credit \nreport.8 \n \n \nApplicant stated that she paid the $212 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.gg. The debt \nwas reported with a $212 balance on the February 2016 combined credit report. The \nFebruary 2018 Experian credit report and the March 2018 TransUnion credit report, \nwhich were submitted by Applicant, also report the account with a $212 balance.9 \n                                                          \n5 Items 2, 3. \n \n6 Items 2, 3; AE E, G-J. \n \n7 Items 2, 3, 6, 7: AE E. \n \n8 Items 2, 3, 6, 7; AE E. \n \n9 Items 2, 3, 6; AE E. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $60 debt for a returned check (SOR \u00b6 1.hh). She \nstated that her credit union was hacked during the time the check was being processed. \nThe debt was reported by Experian on the February 2016 combined credit report and on \nthe three credit reports from February and March 2018. On July 18, 2018, she sent a \nletter to the creditor requesting verification of the account and deletion from her credit \nreport if not verified. No additional information on its status was provided.10 \n \n \nApplicant stated that she paid the $54 debt for a toll bridge (SOR \u00b6 1.oo). The \ndebt was reported by TransUnion on the February 2016 combined credit report. It is not \nreported on any subsequent report.11 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing some of the medical debts, while denying owing the \nrest. Some of the debts have been removed from her credit report, but there is no other \nevidence that any of the medical debts have been paid.12 \n \n \nCredit reports indicate that Applicant paid or settled a $188 debt and a $402 debt \nthat were not alleged in the SOR. The February 2016 credit report lists a $19,671 \ndeferred student loan. The balance had increased to $26,966 on the October 2017 \ncredit report. The loan is reported in March 2018 as deferred with a $27,366 balance. \nThe deferment was scheduled to end in May 2018.13   \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.v; 1.c and 1.p; and 1.d, 1.t, and 1.u are \nduplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v, 1.p, 1.t, \nand 1.u are concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems primarily to unemployment, \nunderemployment, her children\u2019s significant medical problems, and the costs associated \nwith being a single mother of two children without meaningful support from the \n\n \n7 \n \nchildren\u2019s father. Those events qualify as conditions that were largely beyond her \ncontrol.  \n \n \nApplicant paid or settled a $188 debt and a $402 debt before the SOR was \nissued. When she responded to the SOR and FORM, she indicated that she was paying \nher debts through a debt-settlement program. Only one of the four debts in the DSP can \nbe positively ascribed to any of the debts alleged in the SOR. She wrote that she would \n\u201ccontinue to work on paying off all of [her] debt as quickly as possible.\u201d I reopened the \nrecord to provide her the opportunity to submit additional documentation. She did not \nmaintain the DSP. Instead, on January 29, 2019, she retained a law firm to repair her \ncredit and dispute inaccurate items on her credit report. On February 27, 2019, she paid \nthe $435 debt to the telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that several debts were paid, and she disputed owing other \ndebts. Some debts have been removed from her credit reports. Other than the three \ndebts discussed in the above paragraph, there is no proof that any of the debts have \nactually been paid. Nonetheless, I am crediting Applicant with mitigation for all the \nmedical debts and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.cc, and 1.oo. \n \n \nEven with reopening the record and giving Applicant credit in mitigation as \ndiscussed above, I am left with unanswered questions and lingering security concerns. I \nknow little about the current state of her finances, such as whether and how she plans \nto pay the debts that are her responsibility.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.aa: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.bb:  \n \n  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.cc-1.ff:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.gg-1.hh:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.ii-1.oo:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

His request for \ncontinued security clearance eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 26, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor his employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \n01/10/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have a security clearance.1 \n \n \nOn March 5, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that \nraise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for financial considerations \n(Guideline F) and criminal conduct (Guideline J). Applicant timely responded to the SOR \n(Answer) and requested a hearing.  \n \n \nI received the case on August 9, 2018, and convened the requested hearing on \nNovember 29, 2018. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) \nA \u2013 D. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on December 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed $43,404 for ten \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). Under Guideline J, it was alleged that on \nFebruary 28, 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with first-degree assault and use \nof a firearm (SOR 2.a). Applicant admitted with explanations and supporting documents \nall of the SOR allegations. In his e-QIP, he disclosed most of the information addressed \nin the SOR, and the Government\u2019s exhibits support each of the SOR allegations. (Answer; \nGX 1 \u2013 4) In addition to the facts thus established, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and is \nworking toward his master\u2019s degree in that field. He also recently obtained several work-\nrelated certifications in the information technology (IT) field. Since at least 2006, he has \nworked for several companies in IT positions, including federal contractors in positions \nthat require a security clearance. He most recently held a top secret clearance with \neligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI). Applicant attributes \nhis financial problems to a period of unemployment and under-employment after he was \nlaid off in February 2013. Applicant\u2019s employer lost a contract for classified work and could \nnot retain him. Applicant was unable to find IT work that required a TS/SCI clearance and \nhad to settle for a variety of jobs, both in IT and others, that did not last long and which \ndid not pay very well. Applicant reports being unemployed for all of 2014. In September \n2015, he was hired as a desktop analyst by the company that sponsored his current \napplication for clearance. (Answer; GX 1; AX D; Tr. 8) \n \n \nBefore he was laid off in 2013, Applicant had no difficulty meeting all of his financial \nobligations and was financially well-off, earning as much as $95,000 annually at one time. \nIn late 2011, he started his own marketing business while still working full-time. To support \nhis business venture, he relied on credit and overdraft protection accounts he had opened \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nat his credit union between 2005 and 2011. Those accounts were in good standing until \nabout September 2013, when they became delinquent. They are addressed in SOR 1.a \n\u2013 1.d. Since late 2016, Applicant has been making nominal monthly payments on those \ndebts as part of an organized effort to resolve all of his debts. He has paid the debt at \nSOR 1.d. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX C; Tr. 48, 72 \u2013 75) \n \n \nApplicant also established in his response to the SOR that he has paid the debts \nat SOR 1.f \u2013 1.i, and that he consistently is making monthly payments to the debt at SOR \n1.e according to a settlement plan he negotiated with that creditor. The debt at SOR 1.j \narose from injuries suffered in a car accident that was not Applicant\u2019s fault. At the time it \nhappened, Applicant did not have medical insurance. He is currently waiting for proceeds \nto be paid in response to a claim he filed against the other driver\u2019s insurance. (Answer) \n \n \nApplicant was earning about $65,000 annually and had no financial problems \nbefore he was laid off in 2013. In October 2015, he found work that paid him enough to \nmove out of his parents\u2019 home and to buy a car. Since then, he has paid his rent and car \nloan as required. Applicant also presented information showing he completed a well-\nknown financial management course that has helped him effectively attack his debts and \nreduce his expenses. Using the lessons from that course, Applicant paid off those debts \nthat were within his means to do so; he negotiated with his creditors to establish \nrepayment agreements; and he has positioned himself to start paying more money to \nSOR 1.a \u2013 1.c, the largest of his remaining debts. Applicant adheres to a detailed monthly \nbudget and has eschewed building savings in favor of paying his debts. (Answer; Tr. 46 \n\u2013 72, 75 \u2013 81) \n \n \nOn February 28, 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with first-degree \nassault and use of a firearm. The charges were brought by Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend \nand stemmed from an argument they had the day before. Both parties had called the \npolice as the argument escalated, but no arrests were made that day. Applicant denied \nassaulting his ex-girlfriend, claiming instead that she repeatedly struck him on the back \nof the head as he was leaving her house. He required medical attention that evening. He \nadmits he damaged his ex-girlfriend\u2019s cell phone during the altercation. He also admits \nhe legally owns a registered firearm, but avers it was at his parents\u2019 house, where he lived \nat the time. His ex-girlfriend decided that evening to file a criminal complaint against \nApplicant, and local sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested Applicant at his house on February 28, \n2016. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4; AX A; Tr. 20 \u2013 46) \n \n \nApplicant never appeared at a hearing to answer the charges, which he has \nadamantly denied. On July 26, 2016, prosecutors dismissed the charges as being \nunsupported by any evidence. Available information also shows that Applicant\u2019s ex-\ngirlfriend has filed numerous other groundless complaints against other boyfriends and \nagainst family members. (Answer; AX A; Tr. 63 \u2013 68) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,2 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) \nof the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n                                                 \n2 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n3 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established Applicant accrued the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR. When the SOR was issued, most of those debts had not been resolved. That \ninformation reasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is \narticulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, available information supported application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). By contrast, Applicant established that his financial problems arose \nfrom unexpected periods of unemployment and under employment starting in February \n2013. In response to those circumstances, Applicant took whatever work he could, while \nat the same time reducing his living and other expenses. In late 2015, he was able to earn \nenough money to support himself and begin addressing his debts. He has been \naddressing most of his debts since 2016, and he has paid five of the debts alleged in the \nSOR. Of the remaining five debts, he is in repayment of four debts through plans \nnegotiated with those creditors. The debt at SOR 1.j is a medical debt likely to be satisfied \nthrough insurance payment from the at-fault driver in a recent accident with Applicant. \n \nApplicant also showed that he completed a well-known financial management \ncourse. He is acting on the lessons learned from that course by managing his finances \nthrough a detailed monthly budget. He also has significantly reduced expenses in order \nto pay down his debts in a reliable and systematic way before setting aside money for \nsavings. All of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions: \n  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude the record as a whole is sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s finances. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant was arrested as alleged in the SOR. \nThat information reasonably raised a security concern about criminal conduct that is \narticulated at AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe only specific disqualifying condition to be considered here is at AG \u00b6 31(b) \n(evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters \nof official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally \ncharged, prosecuted, or convicted). Available information showed that Applicant was, in \nfact, charged with assault and a firearm offense. However, the record does not contain a \npolice report or other reliable information about what Applicant did or did not do. By \ncontrast, Applicant established that the charges were dismissed before trial. Applicant \nhas no further connection to his accuser and it is unlikely that the circumstances leading \nto that altercation will recur. AG \u00b6 31(b) does not apply because available information \ndoes not include evidence or even a credible allegation of wrongdoing by Applicant. \n \nIn the alternative, this record requires application of the following mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 32(c) (no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense). I conclude that all available information probative of this issue shows that any \nsecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s arrest are mitigated. \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Particularly noteworthy is the information regarding Applicant\u2019s response to \nadverse financial circumstances. It reflects well on Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. A \nfair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole shows the security \nconcerns about his finances are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 2.a: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his \nhistory of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non August 4, 2017. This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on March 9, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2018. He admitted all but one of the \nallegations, and he provided some brief explanations. He also requested an in-person \nhearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on August 9, 2018, and then reassigned \nto me on October 22, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on October 25, 2018. \nApplicant appeared without counsel. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-4 and A-H, respectively. No \nwitnesses other than Applicant were called.  \n \nThe record was kept open until November 25, 2018, to allow Applicant an \nopportunity to provide additional documentary evidence. He made a timely submission, \nand the post-hearing matters (tax records from the IRS) are admitted without objections \nas Exhibits I-K.   \n \nRuling on Procedure \n \nAt the close of evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by \nadding two allegations concerning Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state and federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2015 as well as failure to timely pay \nfederal income tax as required for those tax years. (Tr. 73-77) Applicant objected \nbecause he did not have documentation concerning the federal tax matters. I overruled \nthe objection, but granted Applicant an additional 30 days, until November 25, 2018, to \nprovide relevant documentation. Accordingly, the SOR was amending by adding the \nfollowing: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m\u2014You failed to timely file state income tax returns for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2015; and \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n\u2014You failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2015, and you failed to timely pay federal income tax when due for those tax \nyears.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. He is employed as a transportation operations specialist. He has been so \nemployed since March 2016. His formal education includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nbusiness administration awarded in 2008. He has never married and has no children.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes three periods of unemployment since \n2011. He was laid off from a job in February 2011 and unemployed until about June \n2011. He then had a part-time job as an office assistant from June 2011 to November \n2011, when he departed because it was a temporary job. He was unemployed from \nNovember 2011 to February 2012. He then had another part-time job as a museum \nguide from February 2012 to November 2015, when he was terminated or fired. He was \nunemployed from November 2015 to March 2016, when he began his current job. He \n\n \n3 \n \nreceived unemployment compensation during all three periods of unemployment. He \nestimated that it amounted to 60% less than the income he earned.  \n  \nThe SOR, as amended, concerns a history of financial problems consisting of the \nfollowing: (1) six delinquent student loan accounts placed for collection or charged off \nfor a total of approximately $62,000; (2) five consumer accounts placed for collection or \ncharged off for a total of approximately $5,172; (3) back taxes owed to a state tax \nauthority for tax years 2011 and 2012 in the amount of approximately $2,704, as well as \nfailure to timely file state income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2015; and (4) \nfailure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2015, as well \nas failure to timely pay federal income tax when due for those tax years. Applicant \nadmitted to all the SOR allegations in his answer to the SOR or during his hearing \ntestimony. Additional evidence establishing the SOR allegations is found in the \ndocumentary evidence.   \n \nOverall, Applicant attributed his history of financial problems to the unexpected \ncircumstances that occurred in 2011, the three periods of unemployment, and the two \npart-time jobs he had before returning to full-time employment in 2016. The unexpected \ncircumstances in 2011 consisted of an incident where he was stabbed in the back \n(resulting in only minor injuries) while in a bar, and injuries sustained in two car \naccidents resulting in a strained neck and a bruised spine. (Tr. 39-41). \n  \nThe six delinquent student loans are now held by two different entities. Applicant \nobtained the loans while earning his bachelor\u2019s degree from August 2003 to May 2008. \nThree accounts, with a total balance due of $56,919 as of July 2018, are held by a debt-\ncollection company contracted by the current creditor. (Exhibit B) The debt-collection \ncompany offered Applicant the opportunity to enter into a repayment plan with a \nreduced interest rate in August 2017 as well as a lump-sum settlement offer of $5,490 in \nJuly 2018, but he was unable to accept either offer. He attempted to obtain a loan so he \ncould accept the lump-sum offer, but he was unable to do so. (Tr. 69-71) \n \nThe other three student loans, which were obtained from the Department of \nEducation, are now in a repayment arrangement. (Exhibits C and D). Initially, Applicant \nwas required to make a series of payments to rehabilitate the loans, completed in June \n2018, which qualified his accounts for transfer to one of the Department of Education\u2019s \nloan servicers. A loan transfer of $7,727, with a principal balance of $6,964, was made \nin June 2018. Applicant made payments in July, August, September, and October 2018.  \n \nConcerning the five delinquent consumer accounts, one is repaid, three are in a \nrepayment arrangement, and one is unresolved. Applicant paid the $1,387 collection \naccount, stemming from a mobile-phone account, in full in September 2018. (Exhibit F) \nHe is using the services of a consumer-credit-counseling firm to repay three accounts. \n(Exhibit E) The arrangement began in April 2018, and he made monthly payments of \n$108 in April, May, June, July, August, and October 2018. Applicant denied the $346 \ncollection account in his answer to the SOR, but he acknowledged in his hearing \ntestimony that the debt was his and stemmed from automobile insurance. (Tr. 57-60) He \n\n \n4 \n \nfurther explained that he contacted the debt-collection company, they had no record of \nthe account and advised him to dispute the account, which he said he is doing.  \n \nApplicant fell behind on his state and federal income tax obligations during his \nperiod of unemployment and underemployment during 2011 through 2015. He altered \nhis tax withholding to maximize his income during that period. He did not file tax returns \nbecause he knew he would owe money he could not then afford to pay. Applicant filed \nall the past-due state and federal income tax returns in January 2017, along with his \nreturns for tax year 2016. He also entered into repayment arrangements with both the \nstate tax authority and the IRS.  \n \nConcerning the state, he reached a payment agreement in April 2018 on a \nbalance of $2,773 for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. (Exhibits G and H) He agreed to \nmake $200 monthly payments and has done so through October 2018. He estimated \nowing about $1,000. (Tr. 36)  \n \nConcerning the IRS, he entered into an installment agreement in August 2017 for \ntax years 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. (Exhibit I). He agreed to make $200 \nmonthly payments beginning on September 15, 2017. He made seven monthly \npayments, for a total of $1,400, from October 2017 to June 2018. (Exhibit J). Those \npayments reduced the balance to $2,788 from $4,379 as of July 2018. The most recent \naccount statement from November 2018 shows he owes $2,982 for balances due for \ntax years 2012 and 2017. (Exhibit K)   \n \nApplicant stated that he earned an annual salary of about $59,000. He further \nstated that he had no money in the bank or other financial institution, although he was \nparticipating in his employer\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan. He does not use a credit card and \nmanages his finances with a debit card connected to his checking account.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n5 \n \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n                                                          \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is in a difficult situation where he is dealing with a large amount of \nindebtedness with a number of creditors or collectors. His problematic financial history \nis traceable to unexpected circumstances in 2011 when he was injured in two car \naccidents, and he then began a years-long period of periodic unemployment and part-\ntime employment, which only ended in March 2016 when he began his current job. \nSince then, he\u2019s done a decent job addressing a number of the delinquent debts. Three \nof the student loans were rehabilitated and are now in a repayment arrangement. He \npaid off one of the consumer debts and placed three accounts in a repayment \narrangement. He also filed all the past-due state and federal income tax returns in \nJanuary 2017 (before the SOR was issued), and he reduced the balances owed for \nback taxes via repayment arrangements with the state and federal tax authorities.  \n \n \nUnfortunately, the largest delinquent debts, the three student loans for more than \n$50,000, remain wholly unresolved. That is a sizeable amount of money. Moreover, I \nconsider nonpayment of student loans a serious matter, akin to nonpayment of income \ntax or court-ordered child support. Applicant has neither a realistic plan nor the means \nto address the loans. I have credited Applicant for circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol, and note than he has made progress in repaying debt and fixing his tax \nproblems. Nevertheless, the evidence is not sufficient to fully mitigate the security \nconcern stemming from his long-standing history of financial problems, which is ongoing \nand likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \n\n \n7 \n \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

His request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn July 19, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (Item 3). \nOn February 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B for foreign influence. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based \non information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 1, 2018 (Answer), and requested that his \ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.\n(Item 2.)

He sends them $200 in support monthly. (Answer; \nItem 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents in Sudan. His father is 84 years old \nand his mother is 64 years old. They are cared for by Applicant\u2019s younger brother, who \nis also a citizen and resident of Sudan. In addition to caring for their parents, Applicant\u2019s \nyounger brother is a student. (Answer; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s four sisters are citizens and residents in Sudan. They are married and \nApplicant has casual and infrequent contact with them. (Answer; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents in Sudan. \nHis father-in-law is 62 years old and is employed by the Ministry of Health in Sudan. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is approximately 54 years old and is a homemaker. (Answer; \nItem 3.) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident in Sudan. He is employed  by \nthe Sudanese Ministry of Interior. Applicant reported that his contact with them is \u201cvery \ncasual and infrequent.\u201d (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a citizen and resident in Sudan. She is married to a \nSudanese man. Applicant reported that his contact with them is \u201cvery casual and \ninfrequent.\u201d (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant maintains contact with a friend from Sudan that resides in Egypt. His \nfriend lives as a refugee in Egypt, after fleeing Darfur. He cannot return to Sudan \u201cfor he \nwill be in danger if he chooses to go back.\u201d (Answer.) He is \u201ccurrently working on \nestablishing citizenship other than Sudan.\u201d (Answer; Item 3.)  \n \nSudan \n \n \nSudan is governed by an authoritarian President. The National Congress Party \nhas held near-absolute power in Sudan for almost 30 years. Since 1993, Sudan has \nbeen designated by the U.S. Department of State as a state sponsor of terrorism, due to \nconcerns about Sudanese support to international terrorist organizations including Abu \nNidal Organization, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The U.S. \nDepartment of State warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Sudan due to risks of terrorism, \narmed conflict, and violent crime. Westerners and Western interests are targeted \nthrough suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and kidnappings. Violent crimes \ntargeting Westerners including kidnappings, armed robberies, home invasions, and \ncarjacking occur throughout Sudan. Arbitrary detentions of foreigners have been \nreported. \n \n \nIn 2003, non-Arabs in the Darfur region of Sudan rebelled against the Sudanese \ngovernment, protesting decades of political and economic neglect. The government \nresponded with brutal force, and more than 300,000 people were killed in the ensuing \nconflict. More than two million people have been displaced as a result of that conflict. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife, parents, parents-in-law, siblings, and siblings-in-law are all \ncitizen and residents in Sudan. His ties to his Sudanese friend in Egypt also create a \nrisk of exploitation, should his friend return to Sudan. His wife is employed by the \nMinistry of Education. His father-in-law works for the Ministry of Health. His brother-in-\nlaw works for the Ministry of Interior. There is an articulated heightened risk associated \nwith having relationships with family members in or tied to Sudan, due to Sudan\u2019s \nsponsorship of terrorism, its authoritarian government, and the threats to Westerners in \nSudan. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nNone of the above conditions are mitigating in this instance. Applicant is in close \ncontact with his wife and child, communicating with them weekly and sending them \nmoney monthly. While his contacts with the rest of his family and his friend are less \nfrequent, they are still bonds that tie him to Sudan. A potential for a conflict of interest is \npresent due to his ties to his family in Sudan, the nature of the Sudanese government, \nand the unrest in Sudan. He failed to demonstrate deep and longstanding loyalties to \nthe United States. The record contains little information on assets, or physical or \nemotional bonds to the United States. Without more information, it cannot be \ndetermined that Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubt \nas to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for foreign influence. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. National security eligibility is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Schachter, Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \nMay 22, 2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 13, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines B and E. The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 28, 2018 (Answer); which included \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A1~B2, and eventually requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Notice of Representation.) The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 7, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on March 8, 2019, scheduling the hearing for April 23, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted into evidence, and GX 5 for Administrative Notice. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf. Applicant presented 34 documents, which I marked AppXs C1~L, which \n\n \n2 \n \nwere also admitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on \nMay 6, 2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Afghanistan. Department Counsel provided a seven-page summary of \nthe facts, supported by 11 Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan, identified \nas GX 5. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in SOR, except for SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 16.) He has been employed as a linguist with the defense contractor since January \nof 2017. (GX 1 at page 16.) In August of 2017, while on patrol with U.S. Marines, \nApplicant was wounded by a suicide bomber. (TR at page 38 line 14 to page 40 line 25, \nat page 82 lines 6~25, and AppX C1.) He has submitted eight letters of support (AppXs \nA, E and J), to include one from a Brigadier General (AppX E5), and numerous \nCertificates of Appreciation (AppX H1~9). \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a. Applicant denied that his mother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, as \nshe is now deceased. (TR at page 43 lines 16~18, and at page 44 lines 2~6.) This \noccurred in January of 2018, and Applicant could not attend her funeral as he could not \nleave the protection of his military post. (Id.)  \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admits that three brothers are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. (TR at page 50 line 10 to page 52 line 3, and at page 53 line 14 to page 55 \nline 6.) Two of these brothers are merchants, and the third a teacher. (Id.) To the best of \nhis knowledge and belief none of these brothers are connected to the Afghan \ngovernment. \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admits that a fourth brother, also a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan, was a \u201cClerk\u201d for the Afghan government. (TR at page 52 line 4 to page 53 \nline 12.) He is currently unemployed, but most recently worked for a U.S. company. (TR \nat page 55 lines 7~21, and at page 69 lines 7~23.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that between 2010~2016, he gave a total of about $5,000 \nto a brother, in support of his, now deceased, mother. Applicant disclosed this financial \n\n \n3 \n \nsupport to the U.S. Government, in January of 2011, as evidenced by his \nCounterintelligence-Focused Security Screening Questionnaire (CFSSQ). (TR at page \n42 line 7 to page 43 line 18, at page 55 line 22 to page 56 line 11, and GX  at page 7.) \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \n2.a. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d on his February 2017 e-QIP to the question: \u201cHave \nyou EVER provided financial support for any foreign national?\u201d (GX 1 at page 51.) He \nmistakenly thought this question did not apply to his immediate family. (TR at page 56 \nline 12 to page 60 line 6, and at page 71 line 1 to page 74 line 24.) Applicant had \nalready disclosed his mother\u2019s financial support, through his brother, in his January \n2011 CFSSQ. He reaffirmed his 2011 admission, just 12 days after he executed his e-\nQIP, when he again executed a February 2017 CFSSQ. (GX 4 at pages 1 and 2.) I find \nno willful falsification, here. \n \n \n2.b. Applicant admits that he resided in the United States illegally from about \n2006~2010. In about 2003, as an 18 year old, he started working as an interpreter for \nU.S. Forces in Afghanistan. (TR at page 22 lines 5~13, and at page 28 line 21 to page \n31 line 12.) In 2006, while Applicant was training in the United States, he discovered he \nwas on a \u201chit list\u201d if and when he returned to Afghanistan. (Id, and 60 line 7 to page 61 \nline 9, and at page 68 line 11 to page 69 line 2.)  As a result, he went to live with a half-\nbrother in California from 2006~2010. (Id.) Applicant disclosed his illegal status when he \napplied for and was granted a Green Card. (TR at page 34 line 17 to page 36 line 11, \nand at page 37 line 1 to page 38 line 13.) He was again deployed back to Afghanistan in \nsupport of U.S. forces, and while there applied for and was granted U.S. citizenship. \n(Id.) \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following regarding Afghanistan. A U.S. \nDepartment of State Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan. Extremist groups \nand kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals. Decades of disorder \nand warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terroism.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n\n \n4 \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n\n \n5 \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n  \nApplicant has siblings who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan, and he is \non a Taliban \u201chit list.\u201d The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee. \n \n \nApplicant is putting his life at risk as an interpreter for U.S. Forces. He was \nalmost killed by a suicide bomber, but has returned to Afghanistan in service of his \n\n \n6 \n \ncountry. His connection with his foreign relatives is clearly outweighed by his service \nand allegiance to the United States. Foreign Influence is found for Applicant. \n  \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n  \nApplicant arguably failed to answer his February 2017 e-QIP correctly. He was \nalso in the United States illegally for about four years. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment \n \n \nApplicant disclosed to the Government, in 2011 and again in February of 2017; \nthe fact that he was providing financial aid to his mother, when he executed his \nCFSSQs. In light of these disclosures, he clearly misinterpreted the e-QIP\u2019s question. \nMore than nine years ago, Applicant feared for his life; and as a result, resided in the \nUnited States illegally for about four years. He is now a U.S. citizen, and is putting his \nlife at risk serving his country in Afghanistan. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant has a distinguished record of serving U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, as \nevidenced by those serving with him, to include a Brigadier General. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Foreign Influence and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n  \n \nOn March 28, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 15, \n2019. The case was assigned to me on June 5, 2019. On June 11, 2019, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for July 31, 2019.  Applicant worked at an \noverseas location and traveled back to the United States for hearing. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. During the hearing, the Government offered nine exhibits. \nGovernment exhibits 1-9 were admitted without objection. Applicant offered 17 exhibits, \nwhich were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 Q, without objection. The \nGovernment and the Applicant requested administrative notice be taken of certain facts \nregarding the country of Iraq. I re-marked the administrative notice documents as  \n\n2 \n \nAdministrative Notice Document I (Admin Not I \u2013 Government) and Admin Not II \n(Applicant). The transcript was received on August 9, 2019. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \n \nAdministrative Notice  -  Iraq  \n \n \nA coalition of countries led by U.S. and British forces invaded Iraq on March 20, \n2003. Dictator Saddam Hussein was deposed and on May 12, 2003, the United States \nestablished the Coalition Provisional Authority as the interim civil authority in Iraq. About \none year later, the Coalition Provisional Authority transferred sovereignty to the new \nInterim Iraqi Government led by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Throughout the governance \nof the Coalition Provisional Authority and the peaceful transfer of power, the role of Iraqi \ninterpreters was vital to U.S. military success. Recognizing the role of local Iraqi \ninterpreters \u2013 and the dangers they faced as a result of their assistance to the United \nStates \u2013 Congress authorized a \u201cSpecial Immigrant Visa\u201d program that allowed local \ninterpreters who served with distinction to immigrate to the United States.  \n \n \nSince 2005, the U.S. government has approved more than $18.6 billion worth of \nforeign military sales to Iraq. U.S. security assistance supports the development of a \nmodern, accountable, and professional Iraqi military capable of defending Iraq and its \nborders. U.S. security assistance programs also promote civilian oversight of the \nmilitary, adherence to the rule of law, and the respect for human rights, while \nsimultaneously increasing the Iraqi military\u2019s capability to respond to threats and \ncounter-terrorism operations. The U.S. Embassy Baghdad maintains the Office of \nSecurity Cooperation \u2013 Iraq to further these goals and to facilitate Iraq\u2019s role as a \nresponsible security partner, contributing to the peace and security of the region.  \n \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The outcome of the 2014 \nparliamentary elections generally met international standards of free and fair elections \nand led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to \nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi.  \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very \ndangerous and the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely \nlimited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups \nregularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also \nthreaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq.   \n \n \n \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to \ninclude press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights.  \n\n3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old linguist employed by a Department of Defense \ncontractor since 2017.  He is currently working at an overseas location supporting the \nU.S. military. He was granted a security clearance in 2016 and is applying to maintain \nhis security clearance. Applicant was born, raised, and educated in Iraq. He received an \nassociate\u2019s degree from a technical college in Iraq. He worked as a contract linguist/ \ntranslator/cultural advisor with the U.S. military in Iraq from 2007 to 2008 and in 2011. In \n2009, a local terrorist group threatened Applicant. He applied for and was granted a \nspecial immigrant visa (SIV). He immigrated to the United States in October 2011. He \nbecame U.S. citizen in 2016. He is married, but is separated from his wife and has no \nchildren. (Tr. 22-26, 51; Gov 1; AE C; AE G; AE H; Response to SOR) (Note: The facts \nin this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or \nlocations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain \nmore specific information.)  \n \nWhen Applicant first immigrated to the United States, he worked several jobs and \nendured several periods of unemployment. During his periods of unemployment, he \nlived off savings and received some help from his parents. His two brothers immigrated \nto the U.S. in 2013.  Applicant lived with his two brothers for about a year. They had a \nfalling out in May 2014, and Applicant has had no contact with his brothers since that \ntime. Applicant had a brief marriage in 2014, which was annulled. (Tr. 47-57; Gov 1; \nResponse to SOR)  \n \nIn March 2015, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army as an active-duty translator. \nHe learned how to operate in a dangerous environment. He was trusted to interpret \nconversations, documents, and other forms of communications to assist the U.S. \nmilitary. He trained Iraqi armed forces, he worked with high profile individuals, and was \ninvolved in tactical missions, some of which resulted in attacks in some of the most \ndangerous locations in Iraq. In June 2017, he was discharged from the U.S. Army for \nmedical reasons with a discharge characterized as Honorable. After being discharged \nfrom the U.S. Army, he was hired as a contract linguist in 2017. (Tr. 23; Gov 1; AE B; \nAE F; Response to SOR)  \n \nForeign Influence \n \nThe SOR raises security concerns because Applicant has family members who \nare citizens of Iraq and several who reside in Iraq. Specifically: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a:  Applicant\u2019s spouse is a dual citizen of Iraq and Canada and resides \nin Canada.  Applicant admits that his wife is a dual citizen of Iraq and Canada.  They \nmarried in April 2016.  Applicant\u2019s spouse did not like that Applicant was always \ndeployed and never home. They are informally separated. Applicant does not know \nwhere his spouse currently resides. His last contact with her was around November \n2017. Once he locates where she is, he intends to file for divorce because they both \nwant different things out of life. (Tr. 26-27, 57-62; Gov 1 at 33-34; Response to SOR)  \n \n\n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b:  Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She is retired and \nwas formerly employed by an Iraqi government agency in a senior administrative \nposition. Applicant\u2019s mother receives a government pension. He loves his mother and \ncontacts her weekly or biweekly depending upon his schedule. (Tr. 28-30, 63, 72-73; \nResponse to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Iraq.  He retired from the \nIraqi Army as a senior enlisted person. He receives a government pension. Applicant  \ncontacts him about once or twice a month. (Tr. 32, 63-64, 81-82; Response to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d:  Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. He is employed \nas an engineer with an Iraqi government agency. Applicant contacts his brother about 3-\n4 times a year. (Tr. 33-35, 70; Response to SOR)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d:  Applicant\u2019s two sisters are citizens of and reside in Iraq. One is a \ndentist who works for an Iraqi government agency. The other sister is a computer \nengineer for an Iraqi government agency. Applicant talks to his sisters about 3-4 times a \nyear. (Tr. 35-36, 71-72; Response to SOR)  \n \nThe last time Applicant visited with his family members who are citizens of and \nreside in Iraq was in December 2018. His mother was in the hospital. They believed she \nwas on her death bed. Applicant stayed for three or four days. His mother recovered \nfrom her illness. Prior to that time, he had not visited with his mother in person for seven \nyears. All of Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq hope to immigrate to the United States. \nThey have applied for refugee status and are awaiting their second interview with U.S. \nCustoms and Immigration. (Tr. 30, 74; Response to SOR)  \n \nApplicant provided information about his family members each time he \ncompleted a counter-intelligence update when he was employed with DOD contractors \nwhile he was a citizen of Iraq, and while on active duty in the U.S. Army. (Gov 3; Gov 4; \nResponse to SOR) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nUnder the Financial Considerations concern, it is alleged that Applicant owes an \nauto dealership approximately $30,121 related to a voluntary automobile repossession. \nApplicant purchased a car in State A (where he was undergoing military training) before \nbeing assigned to another duty station in State B.  After Applicant moved to State B, the \nautomobile dealer attempted to modify the terms of the purchase contract on two \noccasions. Each time, the dealer increased the cost of the purchase price. Applicant \nconsulted a legal assistance attorney, who advised him the automobile dealer breached \nthe contract. Applicant hired a civilian attorney who concurred and advised Applicant to \nship the car back to the dealer.  Applicant had only had the car for a few weeks and he \npaid to have the car shipped back to the dealer in State A. His private attorney wrote a \nletter to the dealer outlining the situation and alleging fraud on their part.  The debt is no \nlonger on Applicant\u2019s credit report.  Applicant has no other delinquent debts and has an \nexcellent credit rating. (SOR \u00b6 2.a: Tr. 36-39; 75-76; Gov 5 at 6; AE A; AE K; AE L; \nResponse to SOR)   \n\n5 \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Personal Conduct, it is alleged that Applicant received nonjudicial \npunishment around February 2017, for violations of Articles 91 and 134 of the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice. Applicant was deployed to Turkey at the time he received \nnonjudicial punishment. He had filed a formal complaint against several members of his \nsquadron on January 8, 2017 and February 2017, because he felt he was being \nharassed and that his unit was a hostile work environment. (AE P) On 18 January 2017, \nApplicant was placed on a medical profile for injuries to his left shoulder. The profile \nincluded no running, no pushups, and no sit-ups for 90 days. The profile also ordered \nApplicant not lift his left arm and to engage in minimal movement with his left arm. \nApplicant complained to the medical staff that he was being harassed by members of \nhis unit.  (Tr. 39-42; 76-78; AE P; AE Q; Response to SOR)   \n \nApplicant testified he received nonjudicial punishment because he failed to follow  \norders to stand at parade rest.  He could not do so because of his shoulder. Applicant \nclaims his fellow soldiers set him up in order to diminish his credibility. Applicant \nprovided a copy of the complaints he made about the conduct of several members in his \nunit and a copy of his medical profile. He did not have a copy of the Article 15 and the \nArticle 15 was not in the case file. He disclosed the Article 15 on his most recent \nsecurity clearance application in July 2017. This is the only time Applicant has been \npunished under Article 15. Applicant believed the Article 15 was unfair. Discouraged by \nthe treatment he received, Applicant opted to be medically discharged. He received an \nhonorable discharge. (Tr. 39-42, 76-78; Gov 1 at 30-31; AE O; AE P; AE Q; Response \nto SOR) \n \n \nApplicant applied to become a contract linguist after his discharge from the U.S. \nArmy. He has had no issues in his current position. (Tr. 44)  \n \nWhole-person Factors  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s was counseled on his duty performance in June 2016 and in June \n2017. Both were favorable. In his 2016 counseling he was praised for helping other \nteammates while on temporary duty in Jordan. His supervisor wrote \u201cYou are a good \nsoldier in my squad when it comes to any task you are willing to take it.\u201d In June 2017, \nApplicant was told he was a valuable member of the team during an annual exercise in \nJordan. Specifically:  \n \nAs a member of the exercise, you have shown great attitude towards work \nand have delivered all your assignments on time. I am encouraging you to \nkeep the same professional manner. You also showed respect towards \nyour superiors and subordinates from both, the U.S. and Jordanian side. \nYou have performed your responsibilities in a professional manner and \nhave showed the best of you. (AE N) \n \n \nStaff Sergeant R. worked with Applicant from late 2018 to early 2019, in Jordan. \nApplicant was a civilian contract linguist. Sergeant R. states that Applicant is a \nphenomenal linguist and has been asset to his organization. His prior military \n\n6 \n \nexperience was helpful. Applicant\u2019s skill at interpretation quickly made him a preferred \nlinguist to facilitate training and professional relations between U.S. and Jordanian \narmed forces instructors. He describes Applicant as \u201cintelligent, loyal and excellent at \nhis profession.\u201d (AE D at 1) \n \n \nCaptain M. personally attests to Applicant\u2019s intelligence, fortitude, and \nprofessionalism. Applicant has exceptional qualities as a leader and interpreter.  He \nstates:  \n \n \n \nApplicant has received several certificates of appreciation related to his duties as \na linguist in deployed locations. (AE E) He provided several photographs which reflect \nhis service as a linguist in support of the U.S. military. (AE E)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n7 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n   \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern under Foreign Influence:   \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign  country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n\n8 \n \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(b) apply. The mere possession of \nclose family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country \nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant\u2019s parents, two sisters and \none brother are citizens of and reside in Iraq. This creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of Iraq\u2019s serious \nhuman rights problems, and its issues with terrorism. The government of Iraq has made \nsome progress, but a heightened risk remains. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq also create a \npotential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect classified information and \nhis desire to help his family members by providing that information. The risk is also \nheightened because Applicant\u2019s parents are retired from the Iraqi government and \nreceive pensions from the Iraqi government. His three siblings who reside in Iraq \ncurrently work for the Iraqi government.  \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nmitigating condition applies: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \n \nAt great risk to himself, Applicant worked for the U.S. government in Iraq from \n2007 to 2008 and in 2011 while he was an Iraqi citizen.  His efforts resulted in the U.S. \ngovernment granting Applicant a SIV. Applicant immigrated to the United States in \nOctober 2011 and settled in the United States. He worked several jobs and then \n\n9 \n \nenlisted in the U.S. Army in 2015. He became a U.S. citizen in May 2016. After his Army \nservice, Applicant became a contractor supporting the U.S. government as a linguist in \noverseas locations. While previously working as contract linguist in Iraq, he worked \nalongside U.S. forces under combat conditions. In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. \nBd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s longstanding commitment to the United States as well as \nhis favorable contributions to national security. He worked under dangerous conditions \nas a linguist for the U.S. government. His efforts resulted in him being granted \npermanent residency in the United States. He enlisted in the U.S. Army for over two \nyears. He was medically discharged with an honorable discharge. The status of his \nfamily members in Iraq remained the same in his previous positions. Applicant \ndemonstrated that he is trustworthy. Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. The security \nconcerns under Foreign Influence are mitigated.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n10 \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying condition that is relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts. \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report listed a $30,000 debt related to a voluntary automobile \nrepossession.  AG \u00b6 19(a) applies.  \n  \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n11 \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThis debt was the result of an automobile dealership attempting to illegally \nchange the terms of Applicant\u2019s automobile contract on two occasions. Applicant \nconsulted a legal assistance attorney, hired a private civilian attorney to represent him \nwhen he returned the car based on breach of contract.  Aside from this debt, Applicant \nhas no other delinquent debts. This was a circumstance which is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant was a victim of predatory lending practices.  He took reasonable steps to \nresolve this issue.  The concern raised under financial considerations is mitigated.  \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes.  \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation, This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (3) a \npattern of dishonesty to rule violations.  \n \n \nBy his own admission, Applicant received Article 15 nonjudicial punishment in \nMarch 2017.  AG \u00b6 16(d) applies related to rule violations. I find Applicant is truthful so \nthere is no issue with a pattern of dishonesty.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating condition applies in Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \n \n\n12 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s nonjudicial punishment was a departure from otherwise honorable \nmilitary service. It is clear based on the Applicant\u2019s testimony, the complaints he \nprovided, and his medical records during the time he received the Article 15 that \nApplicant felt he was being harassed by members of his unit. He opted to be medically \ndischarged and received an honorable discharge characterization. Applicant has had no \nissues in his current job while serving as a contract linguist in an overseas location. The \nletters from SSgt R. and Capt M. attest to his outstanding work ethic and dedication to \nhis job. The circumstances that led to his Article 15 are minor and they are unlikely to \nrecur. The Personal Conduct concern is mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s gratitude to \nthe U.S. government for accepting him as a refugee and granting him U.S. citizenship. I \nconsidered his support of the U.S. government overseas both before and after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen. I considered Applicant\u2019s years of service as a contract linguist \nin Iraq both before and after immigrating to the U.S. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. He had one minor incident involving Article 15 nonjudicial punishment. The \nevents that led to his punishment are questionable and unfortunate. Applicant has since \nmoved on and continues to be a dedicated and successful contract linguist in support of \nU.S. Forces overseas.            \n \nI considered the reference letters and awards indicating the valuable service  \nApplicant provided as a linguist for the U.S. government working on sensitive projects. \nHis lengthy and dedicated history as a linguist in support of the U.S. military outweigh \nforeign influence concerns because his parents, brother and two sisters are citizens of \nand reside in Iraq.    \n \n \n\n13 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the U.S. to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \n      For Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn February 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudication Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).1 In an undated \nresponse, Applicant answered the allegations and requested a hearing before a \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned \nthe case on September 12, 2018.  \nA hearing originally scheduled for December 4, 2018, was cancelled to give \nApplicant more time to retain counsel. A November 29, 2018, notice setting the hearing \nfor January 16, 2019, was subsequently issued. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled, during which time the Government offered four exhibits (Exs.), noted as Exs. \n1-4, and Applicant presented 23 exhibits, marked as Exs. A-W. With no objections, all\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/08/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nexhibits were accepted into the record. Applicant was granted through February 8, \n2019, to submit any additional materials.  \n \nFour exhibits offered by Applicant on February 8, 2019, were admitted without \nobjection as Exs. X-AA. A request for an additional two weeks to submit materials \nresulted in no further submissions. The record was closed on February 22, 2019. In the \ninterim, the transcript (Tr.) was received on January 25, 2019. Based on the testimony, \nmaterials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old divorc\u00e9e with no children. She was married from 2008 \nuntil 2015. Having earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, completed some graduate study, and \nmastered three languages, she is presently an operations specialist. Successful at \nwork, she was recently given a pay raise, increasing her annual salary to $59,000. \nApplicant has received credit counseling. \n \n \nDuring her marriage, both Applicant and her husband worked. She does not \nrecall his salary, but remembers their joint income supported their household, with her \nsalary paying for the lion\u2019s share. (Tr. 19) Applicant found herself in an unhappy marital \nsituation. Her 2015 divorce left her with marital bills that were deemed her responsibility \nand which she could not pay. (Tr. 18) They subsequently became delinquent despite \nher efforts. Her salary as a single teacher earning a gross income of about $32,000 \ncould not cover both the delinquent bills and her current expenses, including rent, food, \nauto, and other day-to-day costs.  \n \n \nAt issue in the SOR are the following delinquent debts: \n \n \n1.a & 1.b \u2013 Student loan ($10,112) and Student loan ($5,993) \u2013 These two loans \nwere combined in the debt rehabilitation process. (Tr. 31) During 2018, a payment of \n$78 was processed toward these debts. Processing for future payments on the plan \nwas delayed because the lender needed tax return information from Applicant. Ex. W \nreflects a payment of $271 on the debts in January 2019. Ex. A is a statement showing \na payment will be processed in the future. Ex. B is a schedule of payments to be made \nin the future. A second payment (pending) is reflected from February 2019 at Ex. Y. \n \n \n1.c \u2013 Past due account with balance of $427 \u2013 Paid. (Ex. C; Tr. 23, 31-32) \n \n \n1.d \u2013 Charged off account ($666) \u2013 Account satisfied and current. (Exs. D-E; Tr. \n23) \n \n \n1.e Debts ($1,051 medical balance from August 2012); 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j ($1,051, \n$118, $118, $118, $86 (medical balances dating from 2014-2015. (Exs. F-J, Z-AA; Tr. \n23-25). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n1.i \u2013 Student debt ($3,013 in collection since August 2014) \u2013 Applicant believes \nthis was incorporated into the student debts since consolidated from 1.a and 1.b, but \nfailed to provide documentary evidence to that effect. (Tr. 34)  \n \n \nApplicant is currently able to pay her day-to-day living expenses and make \nneeded payments to her remaining delinquent debts. (Tr. 25) She now has a savings \naccount. Combined, her checking and savings accounts have a current balance of over \n$5,500. (Tr. 26) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue, some dating back to her unhappy \n2008-2015 marriage, when Applicant\u2019s modest teacher\u2019s salary represented the larger \nshare of the couple\u2019s household income. The rest appear to have arisen after the \ndivorce left her encumbered with sole responsibility for the marital debts based only on \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nher unsupplemented income. To meet the challenges posed by insufficient income, she \ntried to manage the debts, but was unsuccessful. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling and made some headway in \nresolving her delinquent debts. Applicant provided persuasive documentation indicating \nthe delinquent debts noted in the SOR at allegations 1.c-h and 1.j, amounting to \napproximately $2,584, have been addressed. Although equal documentation was \nlacking with regard to the student loan noted at 1.i for $3,013, and the student loans at \n1.a and 1.b, these efforts are  sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(c) in very general terms.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old divorc\u00e9e with a bachelor\u2019s degree and who speaks \nthree languages. She was married from 2008 until 2015, during which time she was the \nprimary earner, generating a teacher\u2019s salary in the mid-$30,000s. She was given \nresponsibility of the marital debts, which were beyond her means without some form of \nmonetary supplementation. She is now a successful operations specialist whose salary \nwas recently raised to about $59,000 a year. \n \nIt is unclear exactly when Applicant first found herself financially able to address \nher delinquent debts. The record seems to indicate her first efforts were made in 2018, \nwith a nominal payment on her student loans before a student loan repayment plan was \ndevised. Applicant has received financial counseling and made more notable headway \nin resolving her other delinquent debts. Applicant provided persuasive documentation \nindicating the modest delinquent debts noted in the SOR at allegations 1.c-h and 1.j, \namounting to approximately $2,584, have been addressed.  \n \nEqual documentation, however, is lacking with regard to the far more significant \ndebts at issue \u2013 specifically, the student loan noted at 1.i for $3,013, and the student \nloans at 1.a and 1.b. Together, these represent over $19,100 in delinquent debt. \nApplicant was unable to submit documentation indicating that the debt at 1.i was made \npart of the larger student loans. Moreover, those larger student loans only reflect \npayments amounting to less than $600, mostly made around the time of the hearing. A \nstronger record of regular and consistent payment is needed to demonstrate a \nmeaningful record of debt repayment. In light of the above, I find that at this time, \nApplicant\u2019s efforts and documentation fail to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n           Subparagraphs 1.c-1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                      Subparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Applicant responded to the SOR on April 24, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  \nThe case was assigned to other administrative judges on June 14, 2018, and \nSeptember 12, 2018, and reassigned to me on December 10, 2018. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 15, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for November 14, 2018. The hearing was rescheduled and \nheard on December 13, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough H, which were admitted without objection.  \n01/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since September 2016. She is a high school graduate. She is \nmarried with an adult child, a minor child, and an adult stepchild.1 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which include tax returns that were \nnot filed on time, unpaid taxes, delinquent debts, and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. She \nattributes her financial problems primarily to her unemployment in 2008 and 2009, and \nher minor child\u2019s significant and persistent medical problems. Her child had multiple \nsurgeries and procedures and requires recurring medical care. Even with insurance, \nApplicant\u2019s and her husband\u2019s annual out-of-pocket expenses for their child\u2019s medical \ncare has been greater than $10,000.2 \n \n \nApplicant and her husband filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in 2012. Under \nSchedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $300,651 in secured \nclaims, which included a mortgage loan and two vehicle loans. Under Schedule E, \nCreditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $4,055 in federal income \ntaxes owed by Applicant\u2019s husband to the IRS for the 2004, 2007, and 2010 tax years. \nThe petition listed debts totaling $83,864 under Schedule F, Creditors Holding \nUnsecured Nonpriority Claims. Applicant and her husband realized that it would be \ndifficult to maintain payments with her husband\u2019s sporadic income, and they converted \nthe case to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their dischargeable debts were discharged in \n2012.3 \n \n \nApplicant incurred additional financial problems after the bankruptcy discharge. \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $6,976. Six of the debts totaling \n$1,724 are medical debts. Applicant admitted owing all of the delinquent debts except \nfor the $253 credit card debt alleged in SOR 1.k, which she asserted has been paid. \nApplicant stated that she paid a number of the debts alleged in the SOR. She submitted \ncredit reports that show that some of the delinquent debts are no longer reported. She \nstated that she has been paying the smallest debts first, and then moving on to the \nlargest debts.4 Her assertions about the delinquent debts are accepted. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant did not file her state and federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 and 2016; that she owes the IRS $5,941 for tax year 2013 \nand $1,313 for 2015; and that she owes her state $1,795 for tax year 2013 and $1,913 \nfor 2015. Applicant admitted all of the tax allegations. She stated that she usually \nprepared her and her husband\u2019s tax returns, and she panicked when she was preparing \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 31, 56; GE 1; AE A. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. at 23-25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5. \n \n4 Tr. at 17, 44-50, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B, C. \n\n \n3 \n \ntheir 2014 returns because they owed so much. She stated that \u201cthen life took over and \n[she] forgot about the taxes.\u201d5 \n \n \nApplicant and her husband retained a tax professional to prepare their income \ntax returns. Their 2016 state and federal income tax returns were filed in November \n2018. The returns indicated their adjusted gross income was $138,018, and they owed \nthe IRS $4,538 and the state $1,059. Those amounts do not include interest and \npenalties. They did not pay the IRS and the state when the tax returns were filed. She \nstated that the tax professional is working on the 2014 federal and state income tax \nreturns, but they have not yet been filed.6 \n \n \nIRS tax transcripts show that as of March 2018, Applicant and her husband owed \nthe IRS $5,941, which includes interest and penalties, for tax year 2013. As of \nDecember 2018, they owed the IRS $4,320 for tax year 2015. They were due a $378 \nfederal refund for tax year 2017, but that amount was withheld and applied to their tax \nliability for tax year 2010. Applicant testified that the taxes owed to the state for 2013 \nand 2015 were paid through a refund from tax year 2017, but she did not submit any \nsupporting documentation.7 \n \n \nApplicant stated that once all the tax returns are filed, she and her husband will \nenter a payment plan with the IRS to pay their back taxes. She also plans to pay her \nstate taxes. Her current job pays well, and she has the financial ability to pay her taxes \nand other debts. She received financial counseling as a requirement of her bankruptcy.8 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 17, 27, 33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5. \n \n6 Tr. at 18-20, 40-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE D-H. The SOR did not allege that Applicant \nowed taxes for tax year 2016. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for \ndisqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation, in \nthe application of mitigating conditions, and during the whole-person analysis. \n \n7 Tr. at 33-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE F. \n \n8 Tr. at 21, 26-28, 32, 38, 45, 53, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n \n5 \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a bankruptcy case, unpaid \ntaxes, unfiled income tax returns, and delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems primarily to her unemployment in 2008 \nand 2009, and her minor child\u2019s significant and persistent medical problems. Bankruptcy \nwas a legitimate means to address the overwhelming financial problems that resulted \nfrom those conditions. She has been paying the non-tax debts, and I believe she will \ncontinue to address those debts. The bankruptcy and non-tax debts are mitigated. \nHowever, she still has not filed her 2014 federal and state income tax returns, and she \nowes the IRS more than $14,000 and her state at least $1,000.  \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018).  \n \n \nApplicant stated that she intends to file her tax returns and pay her taxes. \nIntentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the allegations that Applicant did not file \nher 2016 state and federal income tax returns. That mitigating condition is given less \nweight because of the timing of when the returns were filed and because she did not \npay the taxes owed for 2016 when she filed the returns. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems \nwill be resolved within a reasonable period. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. \nThey continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s unfiled tax returns \nand unpaid taxes are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n7 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.v: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted.   \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guidelines D, sexual behavior, E, personal conduct, and J, criminal \nconduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nOn April 26, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations and \nrequesting a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on September 12, 2018. \nOn November 9, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of \n02/25/2019\n\n2 \n \nhearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for November 28, 2018. The hearing was held as \nscheduled. I received five Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 5) and five Applicant exhibits \n(AE A - AE E). I also incorporated a copy of the discovery letter that Department Counsel \nmailed to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I). At the close of the hearing, I left the record open to \nNovember 28, 2018 for Applicant to submit additional documents. Within the time allotted, \nhe submitted three additional exhibits that I received as AE F through AE H.  The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on December 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old married man with two children, ages seven and four. He \nhas both an undergraduate and a master\u2019s degree in computer engineering. Since 2014, \nhe has been working for a defense contractor as a computer programmer. \n \n \nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He immigrated here in 1997 shortly after \ngraduating from college. The culture of the United States is more socially permissive than \nthe culture of the country where he immigrated from.  Shortly after immigrating, Applicant \nhad few close friends. Bored, he began to frequent strip clubs. In 1999, he purchased sex \nfrom a stripper while visiting a strip club. (Tr. 27; Answer at 1) \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant began frequenting massage parlors and paying the masseuses \nfor various sexual activities, and in 2003, he began retaining escort services for sexual \nintercourse. (Answer at 1) Between 2002 and 2005, he paid for sexual services on multiple \noccasions.  \n \n \nApplicant stopped paying for sex and frequenting massage parlors after he married \nin 2005. In 2015, however, he again went to a massage parlor, where he paid his \nmasseuse for various sexual activities. When he engaged in this activity, he possessed a \nsecurity clearance, which had been granted in 2014, and a re-investigation for a higher-\nlevel clearance was pending. (Tr. 25) \n \n \nDuring a polygraph, pretest interview in September 2015, Applicant disclosed his \nsexual misconduct. (GE 3 at 27) Subsequently, in August 2016, his application for a higher-\nlevel clearance was denied. (GE 3 at 1) \n \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant enrolled in a sexual addiction (SA) counseling program. \n(AE F; Tr. 20) Since then, he has been attending once per week. (Tr. 31) He has been \nworking with a sponsor since September 2018. Typically, he meets with his sponsor after \nthe general meeting has concluded. (Tr. 67) \n \n \nThrough SA, Applicant is working on managing lust and curbing his sexual desires. \n(Tr. 32, 74-75) Similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, it has a 12-step program. Applicant \nrecently graduated to Step 1. When Applicant first began attending SA, he spoke with his \nsponsor daily, in addition to their weekly meetings. As he has advanced through the \nprogram, he now speaks to him two or three days per week outside of the weekly \nmeetings. (Tr. 60) \n\n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is aware of his transgressions. They \u201chave talked a great deal about \nwhat happened and [she] feel[s] [they] have only come out stronger\u201d as a result of this \nmarital crisis. (Answer, Attachment 1) Applicant and his wife practice meditation together, \nand recently began attending marital counseling. (AE H) His wife characterized their \nrelationship as happy and trusting. (Tr. 14) \n \n \nApplicant is respected on the job. Per his employer, he brings a creative approach to \nsolving software problems and works well with his teammates. (AE B at 4) According to a \nclient, he possesses \u201cvast technical knowledge and expertise,\u201d and is a valuable asset to \nhis employer. (AE A) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n4 \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress . . . may raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of paying for sexual services from prostitutes, masseuses, and \nstrippers triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, \nwhether or not the individual has been prosecuted; and 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes \nan individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d Applicant enrolled in SA \nto address his issues, and he has been attending once a week for the past year. His wife is \naware of his sexual misconduct. They have addressed the strain it caused in their \nrelationship through meditation. Moreover, they have recently enrolled in marital \ncounseling. Applicant testified that he has internalized the lessons learned from SA and \nunderstands how to manage his lust. In conjunction with his wife\u2019s testimony that this crisis \nhas ultimately strengthened their marriage, I conclude Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible. \nAG \u00b6 14(c), \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 14d), \u201cthe individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and consistent \ncompliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a favorable prognosis from a \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n5 \n \nqualified mental health professional indicating the behavior is readily controllable with \ntreatment,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the sexual behavior security concerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(e), \n\u201cpersonal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by \na foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent episode of sexual misconduct occurred nearly four years \nago, he told his wife about it, and he enrolled in SA counseling. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other \npositive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concern. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness, [and] by its very nature . . . calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Applicant\u2019s \nsexual misconduct was illegal. Consequently, AG \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence . . . of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted,\u201d applies. In addition to the passage of time and the engagement in counseling, \nas discussed in the previous sections, Applicant has a good employment record. The \ncriminal conduct is mitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal \nbehavior happened . . .,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including \nbut not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nBy soliciting prostitutes and seeking sexual services from brothels masquerading as \nmassage parlors, Applicant immersed himself into a criminal underworld of illegal activity. \nAs such, these are serious transgressions. Moreover, although Applicant stopped this \nbehavior after getting married in 2005, it recurred ten years later. Conversely, Applicant has \nnow addressed the problem, confessing to his wife and enrolling in counseling. Given the \nlength of time since the recurrence and the length of time he has been attending \ncounseling, I am persuaded that the possibility of recurrence is minimal. In sum, I conclude \nthat the length of time since the last episode of misconduct, the minimal vulnerability to \n\n6 \n \ncoercion, and the robust presence of rehabilitation outweighs the nature and seriousness \nof the conduct. Applicant has mitigated the security concern.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

Applicant admitted she used her \n\n \n3 \n \n \ngovernment credit card to take out three \u201ccash advance[s] for gas money and to help \nsupplement for food and bills.\u201d She set up a repayment plan with her employer, but failed \nto complete the repayment plan when she terminated her employment in August 2012. \nThe debt was eventually discharged in her 2017 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, discussed below. \nShe received an IRS 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, from this creditor.  (Answer; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant was indebted to her state taxation authority for delinquent taxes in the \namount of $2,218 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). In February 2018, she set up a payment agreement to \nresolve this debt through 23 monthly payments of $145. She failed to produce \ndocumentation of payments under that agreement. This debt is unresolved. (Answer; Item \n5.) \n \n \nIn October 2017 Applicant filed her second petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a). She discharged $115,187 in debt on January 10, 2018. (Item 4; Item 7; Item 8.) \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling from a financial readiness center. \nDocumentation from financial counseling suggests Applicant and her husband have a \nmonthly surplus of $1,094, after their monthly expenses are paid. The financial counselor \nadvised them to pay off small debts first and begin to pay back student loans, which are \ncurrently in deferred status. The financial counselor recommended Applicant\u2019s husband \nquit smoking. They were advised to eliminate unnecessary services and subscriptions to \nsave money. It is unclear from the record if Applicant implemented any of these \nsuggestions, although she indicated she was working to improve her finances and resolve \nher debts. (Answer; Response.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant discharged $155,518 of delinquent debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nin 2010. She then incurred another $115,187 in debt, which she discharged in Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2018. She has a history of not meeting her financial obligations and \nspending beyond her means. She misused her government credit card on three \noccasions in 2012, which was an intentional breach of the government\u2019s trust. There is \nsufficient evidence to establish disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(d), and 19(e). \n \n \nApplicant failed to file Federal and state taxes in a timely manner in 2011. She \nfailed to pay her Federal income taxes for 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014. She also incurred \nan unresolved state tax liability. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nAG \u00b6 19(f). \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant discharged a significant amount of delinquent debt through two Chapter \n7 bankruptcies, just eight years apart. Her financial circumstances remain largely \nunchanged, and there is no evidence that she will be able to avoid delinquent accounts \nin the future. She remains indebted for Federal and state taxes. Her debt is ongoing. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed the financial problems to her separation from her husband, his \nmedical problems, and her unemployment. Those are circumstances beyond her control. \nHowever, those circumstances do not mitigate her poor judgment in using her \ngovernment credit card for personal purchases. Further, the record lacks documentation \nto show she reasonably and responsibly addressed her delinquencies. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.  \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation of financial counseling. However, there is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that she is making a good-faith effort to repay her \ncreditors or that she has taken the advice of the credit counselor. There is minimal \nevidence to conclude that her financial problems are under control. The evidence does \nnot establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence of a reasonable basis to dispute any of her \nalleged delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant filed her state and Federal income tax return for 2011. She has been \nrelieved of liability for tax years 2010, 2012, and 2013, after the IRS wrote off those debts. \nApplicant provided no evidence of arrangements to resolve her Federal tax debt for 2014. \nShe provided no documentation of payments to the state taxation authority under her \nagreement. Documentation of compliance with those arrangements is necessary. AG \u00b6 \n20(g) does not mitigate the Government\u2019s concern. \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has recently \ndischarged delinquent debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and has the opportunity to \nrebuild her credit. While Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence about her overall \nfinancial stability to conclude further tax problems or financial delinquencies are unlikely, \nshe will be  on a path to financial stability if she follows the advice of the financial \ncounselor, resolves her tax debts, and addresses her student loans. She may be eligible \nfor national security eligibility in the future if she is able to document reasonable and \nresponsible actions to maintain solvency. The record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Folks, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nOn February 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H. Applicant \ntimely answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) \non November 30, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on December 4, 2018, and had 30 \ndays to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and he provided a two-page \nresponse (Response) to the FORM that incorporated by reference his previous Answers \nto the SOR dated April 30, 2018, and May 4, 2018 (and attachments). Applicant included \na statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse subject \nto revocation of his national security eligibility. The Government\u2019s evidence, identified as \nItems 1 through 4, is admitted without objection. Department Counsel requested that I \n03/18/2019\n\n2 \n \ntake administrative notice of the following: D.C. Code \u00a7 48-904.01 (amended in 2015); \nThe Facts on Marijuana Laws, from the Metropolitan Police Department website; and a \nMemorandum dated October 25, 2014, entitled Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use, from the Director of National Intelligence. I have taken administrative \nnotice of these documents collectively marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. The case was \nassigned to me on March 1, 2019.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He graduated from high school in 1999 and obtained his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. He obtained a master\u2019s degree in 2008. He has been \nemployed as an architect for a federal contractor since 2004. He was promoted to \nprincipal and partner in an architectural firm engaged as a federal contractor in 2018. \nApplicant reports no military service, and he has never married. Applicant previously held \na security clearance since 2007, without incident.   \n \nOn May 12, 2017, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), \nand in section 23 (illegal use of drugs or drug activity) he responded \u201cyes\u201d to questions \nabout illegal drug use and/or misuse of prescription drugs within the last seven years. He \nestimated his first use of marijuana was in January 2002, and he used marijuana (MJ) \n\u201conce or twice a year, for fun, with friends.\u201d2 He also stated that he used MJ while he \npossessed a security clearance and he did not intend to use any controlled substances \nin the future. In an earlier SCA signed by Applicant on December 21, 2006, he responded \n\u201cyes\u201d to similar questions about any illegal use of drugs or controlled substance in section \n24 (Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity).3 He indicated that he used MJ about 10-15 \ntimes between September 1999 and February 2002. He was granted a security clearance \nin 2007.  \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR in April 2018, Applicant stated that his most recent use \nof MJ in 2017, was due to a misinterpretation of the change in the law effectively legalizing \nMJ in Washington, D.C. He used the drug only recreationally at social settings where it \nwas provided by friends and he never cultivated, sold, or purchased MJ. Since the District \nis a federalized city, he wrongly assumed that the legalization of MJ applied across the \nfederal government. Although, he self-reported his use of MJ occurring between \nSeptember 1999 and May 2017, Applicant stated that there was a long lapse of several \nyears before he re-offended in 2017. He does not know which years he used MJ, or the \nexact number of usages. He provided a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement or substance misuse subject to revocation of his national security eligibility.  \n \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s May 12, 2017 Security \nClearance Application (SCA) (Item 3) and his SCA dated December 21, 2006 (item 4).  \n \n2 Item 3, p. 35. \n \n3 Item 4, p. 29. \n\n3 \n \nApplicant has never been diagnosed as having a substance-abuse disorder and \nhe did not seek treatment. He has now disassociated from friends who use MJ. Applicant \nalso attached his resume, detailing his significant experience and accomplishments in his \nprofession, several letters of appreciation, and two performance appraisals showing that \nhe was rated excellent or outstanding in all categories. He has experience working on \nhigh visibility, secure, projects. He received year-end bonuses each year from 2014 \u2013 \n2017. He also provided four positive character reference letters at Tab E attached to his \nAnswer to the SOR, including one from his facility security officer (FSO). All attest to \nApplicant\u2019s integrity, trustworthiness, and reliability.  \n \n \n                                           Policies \n \n \nDOD took action in this case under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n\n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n          The security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG  \n\u00b6 24:   \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n          The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \nApplicant used MJ on sporadic social occasions between 1999 and May 2017, \nincluding after he submitted an SCA in December 2006 and received a clearance. The \ngovernment provided sufficient evidence to establish that the disqualifying conditions \nabove are applicable, and the burden shifts to Applicant to show mitigation.  \n \n\n5 \n \n \n           AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n           (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n           (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n     (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n     (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n     (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n                                                   \n \n             Applicant continued his sporadic use of MJ until his last use in May 2017, almost \ntwo years ago. He did not use continuously during the period from 1999-2017. He self-\nreported and he provided evidence that he has disassociated from friends who use illegal \ndrugs, and a letter of intent to abstain in the future. He misinterpreted the byzantine \nchange in the law in Washington, D.C., with respect to legalizing the use of MJ. He is not \nan attorney and there is considerable confusion surrounding the patchwork of state laws \naround the nation, legalizing MJ. Applicant\u2019s use of MJ has been mitigated by the passage \nof time. He self-disclosed his MJ use in his 2006 SCA, and was granted a clearance \nnonetheless. It is unclear whether this was perceived as acquiescence to his recreational \ndrug use, or whether Applicant understood that his MJ use conflicted with federal law, \nafter completing that SCA. I perceive his voluntary disclosure as candor and cooperation. \nThe government would never know about his MJ use but for his own disclosures. In any \nevent, he now knows, and he has taken appropriate actions to overcome this \ndisqualification. His conduct does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply and his self-reported drug use is mitigated.  \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n6 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline. Most importantly, Applicant was candid and cooperative. \nHe resolved the specific violations alleged in the SOR, and he has unequivocally declared \nhis intention to refrain from further use of illegal drugs.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement no longer remains a security concern. These self-\nreported offenses were committed under such unusual circumstances that they are \nunlikely to recur. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant has \nacknowledged the egregiousness of his drug involvement and taken steps to insure that \nsuch behavior does not recur. He has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline H.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n      FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:               For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility \nis granted.  \nStatement of Case \nOn March 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The action was \ntaken under DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. However, on August 15, 2018, he withdrew that request and \nasked for a decision on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on August 30, 2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant \n12/21/2018\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 5. He was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \nSeptember 17, 2018. He responded to the FORM in a letter dated September 17, 2018, \nmarked Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Applicant expressed no objections in AE A to Items 1 \nthrough 5, which are admitted into evidence as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. \nDepartment Counsel had no objections to AE A and it is admitted. The case was \nassigned to me on December 17, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a government contractor. He graduated \ncollege in spring 2016. He listed no spouse or children. (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn July and August 2014, Applicant was employed through a \u201cco-op work \nassignment\u201d with a government contractor. During that internship-like experience, he \ncompleted a security clearance application and a security clearance was eventually \ngranted. Applicant separated from the employer in August 2014 before any alleged drug \nuse, but through an administrative failure, the Joint Personnel Adjudications System \n(JPAS) was not updated to reflect the separation. Applicant was administratively \nremoved from JPAS in January 2017, after the company did an internal audit. The \nfacility security officer (FSO) certified that these administrative errors occurred. \n(Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant was stressed and sleep deprived due to the demands of his rigorous \ncollege schedule. He was also young and immature. Between September 2014 and \nApril 2016, he used marijuana approximately three times monthly in social settings with \nfriends. He tried mushrooms twice with friends between May 2015 and August 2015. He \nwas arrested in September 2014 and charged with possession of marijuana and defiant \ntrespass. He pled guilty to the lesser charge of disorderly conduct. He was fined $300 \nfor this offense. (Answer; GE 3; GE 4.) \n \n \nApplicant was hired by the government contractor for whom he previously \nworked in May 2017. He completed a new security clearance application on June 28, \n2017. He voluntarily disclosed all of his drug use on that security clearance application. \n(GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant now avoids all environments where drugs are used and promised to \ncontinue to do so. He signed a statement of intent to abstain from illegal drug use. \n(Answer.) \n \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to Drug Involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \n\u00b6 25, and the following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations of the September 2014 arrest for marijuana \nuse, marijuana use from September 2014 to April 2016, and mushroom use from May \n2015 to August 2015. Applicant\u2019s admissions raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand 25(b). AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established as Applicant was not \u201cgranted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position\u201d within the plain meaning of those \nterms at the time he used marijuana or mushrooms. \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 26, \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation \nfrom \ndrug-using \nassociates \nand \ncontacts;  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use spanned over a two-year period, while in college. \nDuring the past two years, he demonstrated his serious commitment to abstinence from \nillegal substances. He ceased using all drugs prior to accepting employment with a \ngovernment contractor, his first professional job. He disassociated himself from drug-\nusing friends and associates. Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred largely while he was \nattending educational institutions. He is now in the work-force and no longer attends \nschool. Thus, he has changed his environment. While the Directive does not define \nwhat constitutes \u201can appropriate period of abstinence\u201d under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), his candor \nabout his illegal drug abuse leads me to accept as credible his assertions of no future \nintent to use marijuana or other illegal substances under any circumstances. Applicant \nhas demonstrated sufficient intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. He signed a \nstatement of intent. He has matured and understands that any illegal drug involvement \nis incompatible with his defense contractor employment. Applicant has presented \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was irresponsible \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nand did not recognize the seriousness of his actions when he used marijuana and \nmushrooms in college. He has now matured. He has not used illegal substances for \nmore than two years after coming to the revelation that there was no room for illegal \nsubstances in his future professional life. His changes are permanent and the likelihood \nof recurrence is extremely low. The potential for pressure, coercion, or duress is \neliminated by Applicant\u2019s abstinence. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He \nmet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 57-year old linguist for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Background Applicant was born and raised in Iraq in December 1960 and immigrated to the United States in January 2011 as a refugee. (GEs 1-4 and AEs A and D; Tr. 57) As an approved U.S. refugee, he was issued a green card entitling him to permanent residency status. (GEs 1-4 and AEs A and D; Tr. 49, 57). He qualified for U.S. refugee status due to years of his working for the U.S. Army in Iraq (2004-2009) through his employments by U.S. companies supporting the Iraqi government. (GE 2) 3 In April 2016, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen and received a U.S. passport in the same month and year. (GE 1 and AEs A and D) He acquired an Iraqi passport after becoming a U.S. citizen due to fears that traveling on a U.S. passport in Iraq would be dangerous. (GE 2) He has since surrendered his Iraqi passport. While Applicant still holds Iraqi citizenship, he has expressed a willingness to renounce it. (GE 4) Applicant has never married and has no children. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 80) He earned a high school diploma in Iraq in June 1981 and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Iraq in June 2003.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nHistory of Case\nOn February 28, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4).\n    12/07/2018\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 23, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was scheduled for hearing on July 26, 2018. A hearing was held on the\nscheduled date. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of four exhibits (GE).\nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and 14 exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on August 3, 2018. \nBesides its four exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of facts\ndetailed in 13 official source documents that are official Government publications.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007). Administrative\nnotice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See\nStein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For good cause shown,\nadministrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named official background\nreports addressing the geopolitical situation in Iraq. \nAdministrative notice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent  with\nthe provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did not foreclose Applicant from\nchallenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing Iraq\u2019s current status. Nor did the notice foreclose consideration of information\nabout the country not covered in the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice, so\nas to ensure accurate and timely assessments of the country\u2019s changing political\nlandscape.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the proceedings, Applicant requested the record be kept open\nto permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with his documented surrender\nof his Iraqi passport. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to\nsupplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond. Within\nthe time permitted, Applicant documented his submission of blood-test information to his\nsponsor and prospective employer. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted for general\nbackground purposes without objection as AE M.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged in the SOR to have: (a) one brother who\nis a citizen of Iraq; (b) two brothers who are citizens and residents of Iraq; (c) a sister-in-\nlaw who is a citizen and resident of Iraq; and (d) numerous other relatives who are\ncitizens and residents of Iraq.  \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly began gambling after receiving $80,000 in\ninheritance and lost all of his inheritance. Allegedly, he obtained loans from his siblings\nto continue his gambling and disclosed his gambling activities in the electronic\nquestionnaires for Investigative Processing (e-QIP) he completed in March 2017. \n2\n\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his answers to questions posed\nby a counterintelligence investigator in a February 2017 personal subject interview by\ntelling the investigator he transferred his inheritance money to his siblings for safe-\nkeeping, omitting facts that he had already spent the money on gambling. Allegations of\nincurring gambling losses under Guideline F were incorporated by subparagraph 3.b of\nGuideline E.\n In his response to the SOR allegations covering Guideline B, Applicant partially\nadmitted and partially denied each of the allegations. He claimed his oldest brother is a\ndual-U.S. citizen who currently resides in the United States and maintains no contact\nwith Applicant. He claimed his two other brothers are Iraqi citizens residing in Iraq who\nare currently waiting for authorization to immigrate ot the United States. He also claimed\nthat his sister-in-law is married to his youngest brother residing in Iraq and does not\nspeak to Applicant. And he claimed that he does not speak with any of his extended \nfamily members in Iraq who are employed by the Iraqi government.\nAddressing his alleged delinquent debts, Applicant partially admitted and partially\ndenied allegations pertaining to his gambling. He admitted to receiving an inheritance\nbut denies losing all of his inheritance on gambling and obtaining loans from his siblings\nto finance his gambling. He denied being an abusive gambler and denies engaging in\nany gambling since 2016.\nResponding to Guideline E allegations of (a) falsifying material facts during a\ncounterintelligence-focused security screening by telling an authorized investigator he\ntransferred his inheritance money to his siblings and (b) incorporated allegations of\nusing inheritance money to gamble, Applicant admitted and denied the allegations,\nclaiming he did not lose all of his inheritance money on gambling and was not an\nabusive gambler. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year old linguist for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted\nas relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant was born and raised in Iraq in December 1960 and immigrated to the\nUnited States in January 2011 as a refugee. (GEs 1-4 and AEs A and D; Tr. 57) As an\napproved U.S. refugee, he was issued a green card entitling him to permanent\nresidency status. (GEs 1-4 and AEs A and D; Tr. 49, 57).  He qualified for U.S. refugee\nstatus due to years of his working for the U.S. Army in Iraq (2004-2009) through his\nemployments by U.S. companies supporting the Iraqi government. (GE 2)  \n3\n\nIn April 2016, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen and received a U.S.\npassport in the same month and year. (GE 1 and AEs A and D) He acquired an Iraqi\npassport after becoming a U.S. citizen due to fears that traveling on a U.S. passport in\nIraq would be dangerous. (GE 2) He has since surrendered his Iraqi passport. While\nApplicant still holds Iraqi citizenship, he has expressed a willingness to renounce it. (GE\n4)\nApplicant has never married and has no children. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 80) He earned a\nhigh school diploma in Iraq in June 1981 and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Iraq in June\n2003. He reported active duty service in the Iraq military between December 1982 and\nOctober 1990. He maintains no contact with current or former military colleagues. (GE\n1-4) \nApplicant never served in the U.S. military service due to his being well above\nthe age of qualification when he arrived in the United States. (GEs 1-2) Before\nimmigrating to the United States, he served on active duty with the Iraqi Army as a\nclerk. (GE 4) His military service was mandated by the Iraqi Government. (GE 4) He\nreceived an honorable discharge with the rank of corporal in October 1990 and\nrelinquished all ties with the Iraqi Army. Applicant was awarded no benefits or pension\nfor his Army service. (GE 4)\nSince November 2016, Applicant has worked part time with a non-defense transit\ncompany as a driver and makes about $5,000 a month, enough to support himself. (GE\n2 and AE L; Tr. 39) His application for a linguist position with a global linguist firm in\nFebruary 2017 remains on hold pending confirmation of his security clearance. (GEs 1-\n2) \nAfter immigrating to the Unites States, Applicant worked for DoD contractors.\nBetween July 2011 and November 2016, Applicant worked for various non-defense\nretailers in the United States. (GEs 1 and 4 and AE L) He reported brief periods of\nunemployment between May 2012 and November 2016 when his only financial support\ncame from unemployment disability benefits. (GEs 1-2)\nApplicant\u2019s family ties in Iraq\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents passed away in 2005. (GE 4) While alive, his father\nwas a brigadier general (never in the Ba\u2019ath party) in the Iraqi army before his\nretirement in 1968. (Tr. 40) Applicant has two brothers who are citizens and residents of\nIraq and also served in the Iraqi army. (GEs 1-2 and 4; Tr. 40) He maintains bi-weekly \ncontacts with his youngest  brother but never discusses his U.S. Government work out\nof concern for his safety. (Tr. 64-67) Applicant\u2019s younger brother is married, and his wife\n(Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law) is a citizen and resident of Iraq. (GEs 1-2 and 4; Tr. 70-71) \nLikewise, Applicant\u2019s next-to-youngest brother (middle brother) is also a citizen\nand resident of Iraq. (Tr. 69-70) But Applicant has not spoken to this brother since 2008.\n4\n\n(Tr. 62) To the best of his knowledge, neither of his brothers residing in Iraq ever\nworked for the Iraqi government or have any connections with the Iraq government. (Tr.\n65-66)\nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother is a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States, and\nresides in the United States. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 66-67) His oldest brother was naturalized as\na U.S. citizen in March 2018. (AE I) Applicant does not have a close relationship with\nthis brother and maintains infrequent contact with him, despite their close proximity to\none another. (Tr. 56-58) Besides his siblings and sister-in-law, Applicant has numerous\nrelatives who are citizens and residents of Iraq. (GEs 1-4) Applicant has no contact with\nany of these relatives.\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iraq and neither provides nor receives\nfinancial support from any family member residing in Iraq. (GE 2) Applicant assured that\nboth of his brothers who reside in Iraq live in generally safe and secure areas in the\nBaghdad region; although they are not completely insulated from risk of harm from\ncorrupt Shiite officials who look to Iran for advice. (Tr. 73-74) But because he has never\ndisclosed what he does for the U.S. Government, Applicant cannot foresee either of his\nfamily members in Iraq being exposed to risks of pressure or coercion. (Tr. 62) \nIn a signed, sworn statement of intent he provided, Applicant pledged (1) to\nnever obtain a foreign passport or foreign citizenship with a country other than the\nUnited States again and (2) to continue to have minimal or no contact with foreign\ncontacts outside of his official duties. (AE E) Applicant consented to an automatic\nrevocation of his security clearance should he violate any pledge in his statement of\nintent. (AE E)\nIraq\u2019s country status\nIraq is a country with a population of 27 million that is broken down along ethnic\nand religious lines: Shiites, Sunni, Kurds and Turkoman comprise the predominant\nethnic and sectarian groups.   Once known as Mesopotamia (the fertile crescent), Iraq is\nbordered by Kuwait, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. See Background\nNote, Iraq, at 2-3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008)   At the end of World War I, Iraq\nbecame a British-mandated territory, and founding member of the Arab League. (id.)\nGeneral Abdul Karim Qasim assumed power in a July 1958 coup and held power\nfor five years before succumbing to the Ba\u2019ath Party\u2019s takeover of the Iraqi government,\nand Hasan al-Bakr\u2019s selection as prime minister.  See Background Note, Iraq, supra, at\n4.  When Bakr resigned in 1979, Saddam  Hussein assumed the reigns of power. Under\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s direction, Iraq launched a major invasion of its neighbor, Iran, in the\n1980s. See the World Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. 2018); \nBackground Note Iraq, supra.  Iraq declared victory in 1988 and survived to claim the\nlargest military establishment in the region.  Iraq then turned its forces to mounted\n5\n\nattacks against the ongoing Kurdish rebellion by Kurdish elements in the northern\nmountains of Iraq.   (id.)\nIraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and was repelled by a U.S.-led coalition in\nFebruary 1991. See World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra.  After\nthe war, the UN Security Council required the Hussein regime to surrender to the\ncoalition and submit to UN inspections. When the Ba\u2019ath regime refused to fully comply,\nthe Security Council invoked sanctions to prevent further weapons of mass destruction\n(WMD) development, and to enforce Iraq\u2019s surrender terms.  Coalition forces employed\nlimited no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq and a limited no-drive zone in\nsouthern Iraq to prevent the regime from invading Kuwait again. (id.)\nIn 2003, A U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and succeeded in removing Saddam\nHussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and political power. See The World\nFactbook: Iraq, supra;  Background Note Iraq, supra, at 3.  After two years of operations\nunder a provisional authority, Iraq\u2019s new government assumed office in March 2006\n(with the approval of the U.S. Government), following free elections. (id.)\nNotwithstanding the election of a new national government with U.S. backing,\nviolence continued to envelop Iraq. This violence was fueled and perpetrated by Al\nQieda terrorists, Sunni insurgents, and, Shiite militias and death squads. See The World\nFactbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note Iraq, supra. State Department reports\ndocument human rights abuses that include a \u201cpervasive climate of violence,\nmisappropriation of official authority by sectarian, criminal and insurgent groups;\narbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, torture and other cruel, inhumane or\ndegrading treatment or punishment.\u201d (id.)\nSince March 2006, the Government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad\ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish blocs. See The\nWorld Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2;  Background Note Iraq, supra. at 8. While elections\nhave been held, none of the key constituent groups have been able to form a\ngovernment, adopt an oil law, establish and maintain effective security throughout the\nprovinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile political environment\nin Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that continue to\nunderscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence.\nEconomic developments\nEconomically, Iraq\u2019s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, as it\nhas for the past half century since the completion of new pipelines to Lebanon in 1949,\nand to Syria in 1952  See The World Factbook: Iraq, supra;  Background Note Iraq,\nsupra. As a result of the  U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil refining\ncapabilities were shuttered. The rebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure\nhas continued to expand since 2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from\ninsurgent activity. \n6\n\nProposed oil revenue sharing legislation among the three war-hardened ethno-\nsectarian divisions (Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds) still awaits passage after years of stalled\nnegotiations, however, and at the moment, there are no good estimates of when such\nlegislation will be approved and implemented. See Statement for the Record, Worldwide\nThreat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, U.S. Director of National\nIntelligence (Feb. 2018) For the foreseeable future, the national government can be\nexpected to continue to seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law\nto strengthen and encourage the development of this important sector. See id.\nRecent reports (although not official U.S. pronouncements) suggest that\nBaghdad is close to agreement with the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government\n(KRG) to restart crude flowing from the Kirkuk oil fields as U.S. sanctions against Iran\nhit Iran\u2019s energy sales. See Iraq closing in on Deal to Resume Kirkuk Oil Exports,\nReuters/Bloomberg (Nov. 2018). If these estimates prove to be accurate, they would be\nwelcomed by both U.S. and allied Interests. For despite Iraq\u2019s producing 4.3 million\nbarrels of oil per day, according to published reports, Iraq\u2019s population remains poor.\nSee Putting Iraq-KRG Oil Relations on Solid Legal Ground, the Washington Institute for\nNear East Policy (July 2018). Currently, the case brought by the federal government of\nIraq against the KRG in 2012 over the legality of the KRG\u2019s oil contracts and\nindependent exports remains pending with no disposition projected in the near future.\nSee id. \nPast budget laws passed by Iraq\u2019s national parliament requiring the KRG to\ncontribute certain export earnings in the country\u2019s overall exports (a law that would\nseem to legitimate the KRG\u2019s ownership claims to Kirkuk oil) have never led federal\nauthorities to export Kirkuk-produced oil. In so doing, Iraq\u2019s federal authorities have\nseverely limited Iraq\u2019s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking\nthe oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq\u2019s federal government\ncan have major positive ramifications for not only Iraq and its oil exports, but for the\nUnited States and other Western interests as well. \nTerrorism and human rights issues\nDespite recent improvements in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a\nvery dangerous, volatile and unpredictable country. The U.S. State Department\ncontinues to strongly warn U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq. See Travel Advisory-\nIraq, U.S. Dept. of State (Jan. 2018); Request for Administrative Notice, supra, a 3-4. \nThe State Department assessed Baghdad as being a critical-threat location for crime\ndirected at or affecting official U.S. interests. See Iraq 2017 Crime and Safety Report:\nBaghdad at 2-3. U.S. Dept. of State (March 2017) While crime statistics and crime\nreporting mechanisms are incomplete and inconsistent, the vast majority of\nindividualsunder contract with, or employed by, the U.S. Government in Iraq are\nrequired to travel with a protective security detail, so as to limit potential criminal threats\nagainst them. (id.)  \n7\n\nAttacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue and include\nsites and facilities where foreign tourists frequently visit: hotels, restaurants, police\nstations, check points, foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations, and\nother locations with expatriate personnel. See Travel Advisory-Iraq, supra,  and \nSecurity Message: Expanded Temporary Movement Restriction, U.S. Department of\nState (December 2017) The U.S. Embassy\u2019s ability to provide consular services to U.S.\ncitizens outside Baghdad is extremely limited under the security environment that still\nexists in Iraq. See Country Information: Iraq: Safety and Security, U.S. Dept. of State\n(July 2017); Request for Administrative Notice, supra at 3-4.\nThe U.S. Government considers the potential security threats to U.S. government\npersonnel in Iraq to be sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict\nsecurity guidelines. See Country Information: Iraq: Safety and Security, supra; Request\nfor Administrative Notice, supra at 3-4. The U.S. Embassy\u2019s ability to provide consular\nservices to U.S. citizens outside of Baghdad is extremely limited under the security\nenvironment that exists in Iraq. See Country Information: Iraq: Safety and Security, U.S.\nDept. of State (July 2017); Request for Administrative Notice, supra at 3-4. Terrorist\ngroups continue to mount attacks throughout Iraq and pose heightened risks to U.S.\ncitizens and their family members residing in Iraq. See Country Reports on Terrorism\n2016, US. Dept. of State (July 2017); Request for Administrative Notice, supra at 3-4.  \nTo deal with expanded terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens in Iraq, the U.S.\nEmbassy has expanded its temporary movement restrictions on Embassy personnel,\nboth inside and outside the international zone, in response to the recent announcement\nthat the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. See Iraq 2017\nCrime and Safety Situation, U.S. Department of State (March 2017); Security Message:\nExpanded Temporary Movement Restriction, supra, at 2-3; and Request for\nAdministrative Notice, supra, at 4.\nIn December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Program\nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act of 2015, which amended the existing\nWaiver Program. See H.R. 158 Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel\nProtection Act of 2015, enacted as Public Law 114-113 (129 Stat, 2242), Dec. 18, 2015.\nUnder the 2015 amendment, citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria are ineligible to\ntravel or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. See Request\nfor Administrative Notice, supra, at 7 for additional coverage citation.\nIraq\u2019s human rights record remains a poor one. Based on the U.S. State\nDepartment\u2019s most recent annual human rights report, violence continued throughout\n2017, largely fueled by the actions of the Islamic state in Iraq (ISIS). See Statement for\nthe Record, Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, supra.\nAfter liberating all territory taken by ISIS by the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces (ISF)\nhave continued to pursue and restrict ISIS forces still active in Iraq. \nReports of human rights abuses include allegations of unlawful killings by some\nmembers of the ISF (particularly by some members of the Popular Mobilization Forces\n(PMF)). Reports of human rights abuses also include allegations of unlawful killings,\ntorture, harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities,\ncriminalization of libel and other limits on freedom of expression, widespread corruption,\n8\n\ngreatly reduced penalties for so-called honor killings, coerced or forced abortions\nimposed by ISIS on its victims, legal restrictions imposed on the freedom of movement\nof women, and trafficking in persons. See Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\nfor 2017, U.S. Department of State (April 2018); Request for Administrative Notice,\nsupra. \nImplications of the results of Iraq\u2019s 2018 federal election on U.S. policy\nIn May 2018, Iraq held its parliamentary elections that many believed would\nproduce a new beginning for Iraq and foster progress in the country\u2019s historically\nintractable issues covering such areas as endemic corruption, violent instability, and\nsocial/political polarization. See R. Alaaldin, What Iraq\u2019s election Results Mean for U.S.\nPolicy at 1-6. Brookings at https://brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos (May 2018).\nThis parliamentary election marks the first such federal election since the defeat of ISIS\nin December 2017 and was historic in many respects with over 7,000 candidates vying\nfor 329 seats. See The World Factbook: Iraq, supra and  R. Alaaldin, What Iraq\u2019s\nElection Results Mean for U.S. Policy, supra.\nDespite heavy media coverage and high hopes surrounding election prospects\nfor the prime minister, al-Abadi failed to alleviate religious tension and develop a\nnational consensus in Iraq on the importance of secular governance (only 44.5 per cent,\nthe lowest turnout since 2003), Iraq\u2019s elections did, however, herald a new chapter for\nthe victorious Sadrist movement headed by Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his millions\nof underclass followers. See https://brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos, supra. \nAccording to Brookings reports, the Winner of the May 2018 election was al-Sadr\u2019s al-\nSa\u2019iroohn coalition with 54 seats, followed by the Fatah bloc, headed by Hadi al-Amiri\nwho has reported close ties with Iran, with 47 seats, and the Nasr coalition, headed by\nal-Abadi with 42 seats. (id.) Election results were confirmed by Iraq\u2019s top election body\nin June 2018 following a country-wide manual count, clearing the path for political\nparties to form a government. See  https://www.wsj.com (Aug. 9, 2018) \nWhile prospects for forming a government between the three principal coalitions\nare still uncertain, reported public statements about creating an alliance between al-\nSadr\u2019s and al-Bati\u2019s respective coalitions offer promise for Iraq in the wake of widely\ndiscredited elections. See F. Hassan and R. Nordland, Iraqi Political Alliance Unites a\nU.S. Friend and Foe, https://www.nytimes.com. And although these reports do not\nrepresent official U.S. pronouncements, they are illustrative of the major political\nchanges that are gaining traction in Iraq and bear watching.\nFor Applicant, a Sunni by birth, prospects for uniting the various sectarian groups\nunder a united umbrella headed by al-Sadr are not very promising. In Applicant\u2019s\nestimation, the formation of a new government comprised of the three principal Shiite\ncoalitions is likely to further marginalize Sunnis as a political force among Iraq\u2019s\n9\n\ngoverning elites. (Tr. 74) Applicant posited that the cleric al-Sadr and all of the Shiite\nparties in Iraq will continue to be influenced by Iran. (Tr. 74)\nCurrent U.S. Relations with Iraq\nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership\nwith Iraq and the Iraqi people. See U.S. Relations with Iraq at 1-2, U.S. Dept. of State\n(July 2018). In coordination with the Global Coalition to defeat ISIS, the United States\nassisted Iraq\u2019s efforts to achieve the long-sought goal of liberating all of Iraqi territory\nfrom ISIS. The Strategic framework agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the United\nStates provides the basis of the United States\u2019s bilateral relationship with Iraq and\ncovers a wide range of bilateral issues, including political relations and diplomacy,\ndefense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues,\nservices, science, culture, education, and environment. (id.)\nU.S. bilateral assistance to Iraq is considerable and stresses economic reform,\nassistance to vulnerable groups, and democracy and governance. See U.S. Relations\nwith Iraq, supra. U.S. security assistance supports the development of modern,\naccountable, fiscally sustainable, and professional Iraqi military resources capable of\ndefending Iraq and its borders. The United States has designated Iraq as a beneficiary\ndeveloping country under the Generalized System of Preferences program and has\nbeen proactive in the promotion of two-way trade between the United States and Iraq.\n(id, at 2)  Noteworthy, Iraq\u2019s re-integration into the international community has been\nmarked by their demonstrated cooperation with international institutions, including the\nUnited Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the Arab League.  (id.)\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBefore immigrating to the United States in 2011, Applicant maintained an Iraqi\nbank account from approximately 1966 through 2009, when he closed the account. (GE\n2) The  account was opened by his father and was later supplemented by inheritance\nfunds from a real estate sale that approximated $80,000. (GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 37-38)\nCombined with funds from his prior employment with U.S. companies, he amassed\n$105,000 in the account by 2009. (GE 2)  \nIn preparation for his planned travels to Jordan in 2009, Applicant closed his\nbank account and transferred $95,000 of the closed-out bank funds to his sister for\nsafekeeping during his travels, inclusive of the $80,000 of inheritance monies and the\nadditional $15,000 he had earned. (GE 2; Tr. 50-51) Before departing for his Jordan trip,\nhe retrieved the $95,000 he left with his sister and left the remaining $10,000 with his\nmiddle brother for safekeeping. (GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 37-38) \nWhile traveling in Jordan and Lebanon in 2009-2010, Applicant lost most of these\ninherited funds and continued to gamble with loaned funds from his sister and brother\n10\n\n($4,000 and $1,000, respectively). Applicant never told any of his family members that\nhe used his inherited $80,000 to gamble with, because in Iraq gambling is frowned\nupon. (Tr. 53-54) And telling any of his family members about his gambling he believed\nwould have shamed him with family members and exposed him to potential blackmail.\n(Tr.  53-54) Since ceasing his gambling activities, Applicant no longer fears telling his\nyounger brother about his past gambling and losses. (Tr. 55) \nAfter both of his Iraqi-based brothers applied for visas to come to the United\nStates, Applicant told his sister who lives in the United States not to tell any of his\nbrothers or other family members about his use of inheritance funds to further his\ngambling, and she did not to Applicant\u2019s knowledge. (Tr. 53) Other family members who\nare citizens of Iraq include aunts, uncles, nephews, and nieces to whom he maintains\nno contact, and presumably know nothing about his personal finances. \nWhen interviewed by an agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in\nApril  2017, Applicant traced his principal gambling activities to the 2009-2010 time\nframe. (GE 4) He confirmed having $80,000 of inherited money, which he initially\ndeposited with a local Iraqi bank before withdrawing the monies ($95,000, inclusive of th\ninherited funds) and placing them with sister for safekeeping before retrieving the funds\n(save for the $10,000 he left with his youngest brother) and subsequently losing his\nretrieved funds to gambling in casinos while traveling in Jordan and Lebanon. (GE 4) He\nconfirmed to the OPM agent that after migrating to the United States in 2011, he\ncontinued his gambling, losing $1,000 or more a week, and all of the $10,000 he had\nstored with his youngest brother and later carried with him to the United States in 2011.\n(GE 4; Tr. 52, 56)\nTo finance his gambling interests, Applicant borrowed over $4,000 from his sister\nand $1,000 from his brother. (GE 4) While denying any addiction to gambling, he\nindicated that the stroke he suffered in August 2015 was likely attributable to losing all\nof his savings to gambling. (Tr. 52-53) Still, he affirmed to the OPM agent that he\ncontinued to gamble while avoiding any disclosure of his gambling to his siblings who\nfrown on the activity. (GE 4) \nApplicant assured at the hearing that he has learned important lessons of\nconserving his financial resources since losing his inheritance money on gambling. (Tr.\n57) In a March 2018 signed, sworn statement he provided at hearing, he pledged to\nnever excessively gamble again. (AE F) By 2015, Applicant (working three jobs) had\ncompleted his instalment repayments of the monies he borrowed from his sister and\nyoungest brother. (Tr. 56-59)  Applicant\u2019s assurances are credible and accepted.\nIn the personal financial statement he prepared in February 2017, Applicant\nreported net monthly income of $899 (inclusive of $189 of food stamps) and monthly\nexpenses of  $657. (GE 3) He reported no outstanding debts and a net remainder of\n$468. (GE 3)\n11\n\nApplicant\u2019s screening questionnaire  omissions \nDuring a counter-intelligence-focused security clearance screening questionnaire\nconducted in February 2017 by an authorized investigator of DoD, Applicant told the\ninvestigator he transferred his inheritance money to his siblings for safe-keeping. (GE 2)\nWhether the investigator ever asked Applicant if the monies were returned to him by his\nsister prior to his departure for Jordan in 2009 is unclear. The screening questionnaire is\nsilent on the question, and Applicant could not remember if he was asked the question\nby the agent. (GE 2; Tr. 50-51)\nWithout any evidence of Applicant\u2019s being asked whether the monies were\nreturned by his siblings, no inferences of falsification of his screening questionnaire can\nbe reasonably drawn. Further, when afforded opportunities to voluntarily disclose his\ngambling losses and loans from his siblings to cover his losses, he did so without\nprompting.  (GE 4; Tr. 51-54)\nEndorsements\nApplicant is well regarded by U.S. advisors operating in Iraq who worked with\nApplicant in the November 2004-March 2005 time frame. (AE C)  Project leaders in Iraq\nwho interacted with Applicant between 2004 and 2008 described him as highly\ncompetent and honest in the translation services he provided. (AE C) They found him to\nbe honest, reliable, and trustworthy in the translation of documents assigned to him\ndespite his absence of formal training in translation services. (AE C) Many of his\ntranslation assignments were difficult and required handling in dangerous conditions. \nApplicant is credited with completing a number of courses for his work with U.S.\nadvisors in Iraq. Certificates of training completion earned by Applicant include the\nfollowing areas: procurement systems, advanced driving, strengthening local\ngovernment and provincial  governance, and safety skills. (AE G) Applicant is credited\nwith receiving numerous awards in recognition of his contributions to the U.S. war effort\nin Iraq in 2004-2008 \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of\nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns if any. \n12\n\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied.  Although, the guidelines do not\nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 2(a) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the\ncontext of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a\nsufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not\nlimited to, business, financial, and property interests, are a national security\nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Assessment of\nforeign contacts or interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\n(see AG \u00b6 6)\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\n13\n\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  (AG, \u00b6 15)\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from\ncriminal activity, including espionage. (AG, \u00b6 18)\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\n14\n\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States who has family\nmembers (two younger brothers, a sister-in-law, and numerous relatives) who are\ncitizens and residents of Iraq. Trust concerns are raised under the foreign influence\nguideline due to Applicant\u2019s longstanding family ties to Iraq. Although his contacts with\nhis brothers and sister-in-law residing in Iraq appear to be somewhat limited, they do\ninvolve close family members. While Iraq is a liberated ally of the United States, it is a\ncountry that has encountered difficulty forming a government in the past and continues\nto experience ethno-sectarian conflicts between principal factions and is considered\nan with a poor human rights record and an unsafe country for U.S. citizens to visit by\nthe U.S. State Department. Additional security concerns over Applicant\u2019s finances and\nscreening question omissions  are also raised.  \nForeign influence concerns\nKey to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns are Applicant\u2019s immediate\nfamily members (i.e., his two younger brothers and sister-law) who are Iraqi citizens\nand still reside in Iraq, a country that is still in the process of establishing a stable\ndemocratic government able to protect all of its disparate constituent groups and\nmaintain peace with its neighbors. Despite encouraging developments in Iraq following\nthe federal elections of May 2018, Iraq is still a very dangerous and volatile country in\ncertain sectors with an overall poor human rights record and heightened risks of\nterrorism in most sectors of the country. \nApplicant\u2019s historically close relationships with his two brothers and sister-in-law\nresiding in Iraq make them potentially vulnerable to coercion and non-coercive\nmeasures because of their close familial family ties with Applicant. Because the Iraq\nSecurity Forces (ISF) and non-governmental entities (principally ISIS) operating in\nIraq, as well as the former Iraqi military and intelligence authorities, have a history of\nviolating Iraqi domestic laws and regulations, and international laws, they are more\nlikely to use improper and/or illegal means to obtain classified information in\nApplicant\u2019s possession or control through his siblings and in-laws. \nNoting that Applicant\u2019s contacts with his Iraqi family members typically take\nplace in potentially hostile security environs, the Government urges security concerns\nover risks that his telephonic contacts with his family members (principally his younger\n15\n\nbrothers and sister-in-law) might be subject to exploitation, coercion, or duress by Iraqi\nmilitary and government authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s\npossession or control. Applicant\u2019s activities warrant some application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions of the foreign influence guideline: DC \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact,\nregardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d The citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s\nsiblings and sister-in-law in Iraq pose some potential concerns for Applicant because\nof the risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified\ninformation under Applicant\u2019s possession and/or control. \nAlthough neither of Applicant\u2019s siblings nor sister-in-law in Iraq have any\nidentified Iraqi military or government service, or other demonstrated links to the Iraqi\ngovernment, they remain potentially vulnerable to pressure and coercion for so long\nas they reside in Iraq (even in places considered to be generally safe from terrorist\nthreats).  Were any of these family members to be placed in a hostage situation,\nApplicant could be subject to conflicts over ensuring his family\u2019s well being and\nprotecting classified information. For this reason, DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information,\u201d is applicable to the facts of this case. \nStill, from the evidence presented, neither of Applicant\u2019s brothers and sister-in-\nlaw residing in Iraq have any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or\ninfluence. These historical antecedents limit the risk of any potential conflict situation. \nAnd while the absence of any past coercive measures taken by Iraqi authorities does\nnot absolve Applicant from coercive risks in the future given Iraq\u2019s checkered history\nof political instability, violence,  hostage taking, and abusive measures taken against\nits own citizens, the absence of any evidence of pressure or coercion in their family\nhistory is worthy of considerable weight in assessing foreign influence risks of a\npotential hostage situation with Applicant\u2019s family members residing in Iraq.\nThe AGs governing security clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of foreign\ninfluence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not\nbe in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed\non a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel security\nassessments necessarily embrace similar risk assessments under the new AGs for\nassessing foreign influence risks and concerns associated with the individual's having\nfamily abroad, which include both common sense assessments of country risks and\ninformation available from public sources. \n16\n\nMitigation is available to Applicant under the foreign influence guideline of the\nAGs.  Based on his case-specific circumstances, mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that\nit is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d is  applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. Information about\nApplicant\u2019s family members residing in Iraq, while limited, is enough to permit safe\npredictions about their future safety and exposure to risks of pressure and\ncompromise\nOf benefit to Applicant is MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated service to\nU.S. defense contractors operating in Iraq, while still a resident and citizen of Iraq in\nthe 2004-2008 time period, is impressive and valued by the defense contractors and\nU.S service members he worked for. His contributions to the U.S. defense effort are\nsubstantiated by the numerous endorsements, certificates of training, and awards he\nreceived while working as a linguist for U.S. contractors and military service members \nhe worked with in Iraq between 2004 and 2008. Applicant\u2019s documented  contributions\nto the U.S. defense initiatives in Iraq are sufficiently demonstrated to warrant full\napplication of MC \u00b6 8(b).\nHeightened risks associated with Applicant\u2019s presumed close relationships with\nhis younger brothers and sister-in-law residing in Iraq can be safely discounted\nconsidering all the facts and circumstances associated with his work as a linguist for\nU.S. contractors operating in Iraq and relationships with his siblings and sister-in-law\nin Iraq. Iraq\u2019s strategic location and political character and Applicant\u2019s case specific\nrelationships with his family members in Iraq are reconcilable with his holding a\nsecurity clearance to continue his work as a linguist. His demonstrated honest,\nintegrity, and trustworthiness are established and enable him to overcome security\nconcerns over his having family members in Iraq and enable him to surmount foreign\ninfluence concerns.  \nFinancial concerns\nApplicant\u2019s accumulated gambling losses with money inherited from his family\nin 2009 and later borrowed from his brother and sister are fully documented and\nprovide ample proof of the source of his funds and losses. Applicant does not dispute\nhis use of family inheritance and loans in 2009 to pursue his gambling activities in\ncasinos located in Lebanon and Jordan. His claims that he has not engaged in\ngambling of any kind since 2016 are supported by the admissions he provided the\n17\n\nOPM agent who interviewed him in May 2017 and his statement of intent. Based on\nthe evidence developed in the record, application of two of the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the Guidelines are warranted: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(h), \u201cborrowing money or engaging in\nsignificant financial transactions to fund gambling or pay gambling debts,\u201d and 19(i),\n\u201cconcealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by gambling.\u201d\nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business. (see Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980))\nFailure of an applicant to make more concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts\nwhen able to do so raises security-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the\napplicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nExtenuating circumstances were never an issue in Applicant\u2019s gambling\ndecisions. Applicant committed his inherited and borrowed funds he received from\nfamily members to finance his gambling interests without any influence brought to\nbear from family members and friends. His accrued gambling losses with the monies \nhe received from his family in inheritance and loans from his sister and youngest\nbrother to cover additional gambling have since been repaid. \nApplicant has learned valuable lessons about the importance of conserving his\nfinancial resources and has pledged to never excessively gamble again. (AE F)\nWorking three jobs, he completed his instalment repayments of the monies he\nborrowed from his sister and youngest brother and is currently debt-free. Financial\nconcerns and personal conduct concerns associated with his past gambling losses are\nmitigated. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nGuidelines F and E.\nFalsification concerns\nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s falsifying his answers\nto questions posed by a counterintelligence investigator in a February 2017 personal\nsubject interview by telling the investigator he transferred his inheritance money to his\nsiblings for safekeeping without disclosing his retrieval of the monies in preparation for \nhis travel to Jordan. Applicant\u2019s statements to the investigator were accurate regarding\nhis initial transfers to his siblings for safekeeping, but did not include any answers\nabout his ensuing retrieval of the funds he left with his sister for safekeeping. Applicant\nwas never asked by the DoD investigator whether these monies were returned to him\nby his sister, and Applicant never volunteered the information. Without probative\n18\n\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s withholding evidence from the DoD  investigator about his\nretrieved funds from his sister, no inferences can be reasonably drawn of Applicant\u2019s\nintentionally withholding information.\nTaking into account all of the evidence and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s omissions of the circumstances surrounding his disposition  of inheritance\nand borrowed funds from his siblings after retrieving most of the funds, conclusions\nwarrant that the allegations are unsubstantiated. Favorable conclusions are warranted\nwith respect to the allegations covered by Guideline E. \nWhole-person assessment\nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks to ascertain\nwhether they are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security\nclearance takes account of Applicant\u2019s immigration to the United States to pursue a\nlinguist career with the skills he acquired as a linguist in Iraq. The linguist services he\nprovided for defense contractors operating in Iraq in the 2004-2008 time frame were\nwell received by his superiors and are worthy of commendation. His valued services to\nhis defense contractor employers are enough to overcome the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns over the heightened risks that his siblings and sister-in-law present as\ncitizens and residents of Iraq. Both foreign influence and financial concerns raised\nover his gambling losses are mitigated. Further, security concerns raised over his\nomissions of his gambling losses in the clearance screening questionnaire answers he\nprovided the interviewing investigator are unsubstantiated. Favorable conclusions are\nwarranted with respect to foreign influence, financial, and personal conduct concerns.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas  1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a:\n                      For Applicant \nGUIDELINE E ([PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant\n19\n\n Conclusions\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 22, 2013, and again on July 26, 2017, Applicant applied for a security \nclearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) \nversions of a Security Clearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to \nthose interrogatories on May 3, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n4), (December 10, 2016), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n   12/14/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. In a sworn statement, dated June 11, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on August 2, 2018, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on August 13, 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s response was due on September 27, 2018. Applicant apparently chose not to \nrespond to the FORM, for as of December 14, 2018, he has not done so. The case was \nassigned to me on December 13, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas test technician with his current employer since March 2013. A 1977 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received a non-credited certificate in electronics in 1986. He has \nnever served in the U.S. military. He was granted a secret clearance in 1987, held it until \n1990, and was granted it again in 2013. Applicant was married in 1987, and divorced in \n2002. He has been cohabiting since 2013. He has two children, born in 1989 and 1993. \n \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in about 2009 when he was \nordered to pay $1,000 per month in child support. That amount was automatically \ngarnished from his paycheck. In 2010, and 2011, because of the child support obligation \nand the reduction in his overtime hours, Applicant had insufficient funds to cover all of his \nmonthly bills and his residence periodically went into a foreclosure status. He was laid off \nin October 2012, and he remained unemployed until March 2013. His finances improved \nwhen he obtained his present position, and the house is no longer in a foreclosure status. \nBecause of limited funds, although he was aware that he might owe the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) approximately $1,000 in federal income taxes each year, an \namount that he did not have, Applicant decided not to file federal income tax returns over \na number of years. He failed to timely file federal income tax returns for the tax years \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n2008 through 2014, and he had not done so as of June 2018 when he answered the \nSOR.1 As a result of his non-filings, Applicant owes the IRS substantial back taxes, \nalthough the balance has been stabilized by income tax refunds for more recent years \nbeing applied by the IRS to those unpaid taxes, while penalties and interest continue to \naccrue.2 During his interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in November 2017, Applicant stated that he would meet with his \naccountant in early 2018 to file those missing income tax returns. During the ensuing \nyear, Applicant has offered no evidence to indicate that he has done so, and his Answer \nto the SOR supports the conclusion that he has not done what he promised to do.3  \nIn addition to his problems with the IRS, Applicant also failed to timely file his state \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2008 through 2014, and he had not done so as of \nJune 2018 when he answered the SOR.4 As a result of his non-filings, Applicant owes the \nstate substantial back taxes.

He anticipated being \nable to save funds to address his outstanding federal income taxes.6 It is not known what \nApplicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did report his current net \nmonthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available \nfor discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no \nevidence of any financial counseling. Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his \nfinancial situation is now under control.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d7 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d8   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d9 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \n                                                          \n6 Item 4 (Personal Subject Interview), supra note 2, at 6. \n \n7 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n8 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n9 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate \nto support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. \nBd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less \nthan a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.10  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d11  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d12 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n                                                          \n10 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n11 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n12 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant had seven years of unfiled and unpaid federal and state income taxes \ncovering the years 2008 through 2014. There is evidence that Applicant was unwilling to \nfile his federal and state income tax returns solely because he felt that he did not have \nsufficient funds to pay his taxes. The requirement to file is separate from the requirement \nto pay. The failure to timely file income tax returns has security implications because:13 \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \n                                                          \n13 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.14 In \nthis instance, while Applicant may now be properly motivated, he still has not taken the \nappropriate actions to actually file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2008 through 2014, or to voluntarily pay his back taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), \nand 19(f) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;15 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;16  \n                                                          \n14 See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, \nno foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis \nas inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax \nreturns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \n15 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n16 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is compliance with those arrangements.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties make it \ndifficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it is \n\u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant generally attributed his financial difficulties to child support \nobligations, the reduction in his overtime hours, and his unemployment from October \n2012 until March 2013. However, Applicant\u2019s finances improved when he obtained his \npresent position in 2013, but he has still not exhibited any reasonable efforts to file his \nincome tax returns or voluntarily pay his back taxes.  \nAlthough Applicant indicated that he would have an accountant complete the \nfederal and state income tax returns by early 2018, to date, he offered no evidence that \nthe returns were actually filed. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of \nany financial counseling. There is no evidence of disputes. Applicant offered no evidence \nto indicate that his financial situation is now under control. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.17 \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n                                                          \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n17 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.18   \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 59-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor, and he has been serving as test technician with his \ncurrent employer since March 2013. He was granted a secret clearance in 1987, held it \nuntil 1990, and was granted it again in 2013.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Although it is now mid-December 2018, Applicant failed to prove that he had \nfinally filed his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2008 through 2014, \nalthough he promised to do so by early 2018. In addition, other than having his wages \ngarnished by the state to pay his unpaid state income taxes, Applicant has not shown any \nvoluntary effort to pay his federal income taxes. Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is \nunknown. Considering the lack of evidence regarding his current finances, I am unable to \nreach a positive conclusion pertaining to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:19 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \n                                                          \n18 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n19 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, failing to file his late income tax returns for 2008 through 2014, and \nfailing to take other timely corrective actions. Overall, the evidence leaves me with \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.t.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a material specialist with his current employer since February 2017. A 1993 high school graduate, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 2014, and completed additional credits but no other degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been granted a security clearance. Applicant was married the first time in 2007, and divorced in 2015. He remarried in 2016. Although he did not list having any children in his e-QIP, Applicant has two children born in 1994 and 1996. Financial Considerations1 In his e-QIP, Applicant essentially attributed his financial difficulties to a period of unemployment in 2014 that left him with insufficient funds to pay his rent.

De Angelis, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 13, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On March 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n03/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 13, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated March \n19, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on May 3, 2018, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM on May 16, 2018. Applicant\u2019s response was due on \nJune 15, 2018. Applicant timely submitted several documents which were marked and \nadmitted as Applicant exhibits (AE) A through AE D, without objection. The case was \noriginally assigned to another Administrative Judge on July 26, 2018, but because of \nillness issues, it was reassigned to me on February 27, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.t.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a material specialist with his current employer since February 2017. A 1993 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 2014, and completed additional \ncredits but no other degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never \nbeen granted a security clearance. Applicant was married the first time in 2007, and \ndivorced in 2015. He remarried in 2016. Although he did not list having any children in his \ne-QIP, Applicant has two children born in 1994 and 1996. \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n \nIn his e-QIP, Applicant essentially attributed his financial difficulties to a period of \nunemployment in 2014 that left him with insufficient funds to pay his rent. He also noted \nthat his ex-wife was to repay one particular credit card in 2013 because he was not \nworking. He denied having any other delinquencies, accounts in collection, accounts \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: Item 4 (e-QIP, dated February 13, 2017); Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, \nand Equifax Credit Report, dated April 19, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 12, 2017); \nItem 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 30, 2018); Item 8 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated August 25, \n2017); Item 3 (Answer to the SOR, dated March 19, 2018). \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ncharged off, or repossessions,2 a position that was untrue.3 During his enhanced subject \ninterview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) in August 2017, Applicant initially denied having any other accounts sent to \ncollections. Upon being confronted with certain contrary facts, he generally acknowledged \nthe delinquent status of most of the accounts. He noted that he had experienced several \nperiods of unemployment: October 2012 until February 2013, because he quit his job to \nrelocate to his spouse\u2019s new job location, and he was supported by his spouse and his \n401(k); May 2013 until July 2013, for the same reasons; November 2013 until December \n2013, while he was attending school, studying, and looking for a new job, and supported \nby his spouse; July 2014 until October 2014, after he was fired, and was supported by his \nspouse; and November 2016 until February 2017, after he quit and got remarried.  \n \nDuring that OPM interview, Applicant stated that it was his plan to rectify his \nfinancial problems over the next five years with increased salaries until the accounts were \npaid off.4 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant added that the debt was accrued because \nhe had \u201cendured some hardship\u201d and his new plan was to have all of his creditors \u201cpaid \noff within [two] years, but no longer than [five] years.\u201d5 In an undated Answer to the FORM, \nApplicant modified his plan by stating that he will have all of his small creditors paid off in \ntwo years, and the remaining creditors will be paid off in five years.6  \nThe SOR identified 20 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or repossessed, all generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s April 2017, December \n2017, or April 2018 credit reports. Applicant acknowledged that he had made no effort to \nresolve nearly all the accounts, largely because of a lack of income, but reiterated his \nintention to rectify them. Those debts, totaling approximately $21,206, all of which were \nplaced for collection, are described below: \n                                                          \n2 Item 4, supra note 1, at 37-41. \n \n3 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also \nISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. \nSept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged \ndelinquent accounts, as well as his lack of candor on his e-QIP, will be considered only for the five purposes \nlisted above. \n4 Item 8, supra note 1. It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay \noff delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner \nand otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n5 Item 5, supra note 1.  \n6 AE B (Answer to the FORM, undated). \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) is a joint (with his ex-wife) credit-card account for $6,061 that was \ncharged off, and by virtue of their divorce decree, both Applicant and his ex-wife are each \nresponsible for one-half of the balance; (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) is an automobile loan with an unpaid \nbalance of $4,404 that was voluntarily repossessed; (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) is an apartment lease \nwith an unpaid balance of $3,402 from which Applicant was evicted; (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.h., \n1.k., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.q.) are medical accounts with unpaid balances of $1,966; $465; \n$368; $231; $207; $206; and $195; (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. through 1.g.) are credit-card accounts \nwith unpaid balances of $623; $604; and $491, that were charged off; (SOR \u00b6 1.i.) is a \ncellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $424 that was charged off; and \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j.) is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $372. None of \nthose accounts have been resolved. \nIn addition, there are several accounts for which there is some evidence of possible \nresolution efforts made by Applicant:  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m.) is a cable internet or television account with an unpaid balance of \n$216 for which Applicant submitted one document acknowledging an authorization to the \ncollection agent to debit $108.08 on June 20, 2018 \u2013 three months after the SOR was \nissued.7 There is also a handwritten entry by an unidentified individual indicating that \nanother debit might be scheduled for June 27, 2018, but there is no documentation (bank \naccount or credit card register or statement, or creditor-issued receipt) to indicate that \none payment, much less two payments, had actually been made. The account has not \nbeen resolved. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p., 1.r., 1.s., and 1.t.) are medical accounts with the same \ncollection agent with unpaid balances of $353; $222; $199; and $197, totaling $971. In \nhis Answer to the FORM, Applicant contended that he had paid off each of those accounts \n\u201cas of May 30, 2018,\u201d8 and he attached a letter from the collection agent acknowledging \nhis authorization for them to initiate weekly $100 electronic payments from his account \ncommencing on March 21, 2018, and continuing until May 30, 2018,9 totaling $1,100. The \nauthorization does not identify the creditor account numbers to be addressed. Applicant \nfailed to submit any documentation, including account registers, creditor receipts, etc., to \nsupport his contentions that the payments had been made. In the absence of some \ndocumentation to support his reported efforts, the accounts have not been resolved.  \nIn response to comments made by Department Counsel regarding evidence of \npossible irresponsible spending by Applicant when he purchased a new automobile \n(actually a used 2009 luxury vehicle) in February 2018, for $12,941, Applicant stated that \nmost of the funds came from his insurance after his earlier vehicle was totally lost \nfollowing an accident in March 2016.10  \n                                                          \n7 AE C (Letter, dated June 14, 2018). \n \n8 AE B, supra note 6, at 1. \n \n9 Item 3 (Letter, dated March 21, 2018), attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1. \n \n10 AE B, supra note 6, at 1; AE A (Statement, dated February 12, 2018); Also see AE A (Customer \nPayment History Recap Sheet, dated February 14, 2018). \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nIn addition to the SOR-related accounts, there is an educational loan for $7,268 \nwith an unpaid balance of $5,941 that was placed for collection in February 2018.11 For \nsome reason, not explained by Applicant, he submitted two scheduled payments of \n$131.18 each to a collection agent for an unidentified creditor or account to take place in \nJuly 2018.12 In the absence of some commentary connecting the payments to some \naccount, the significance of the document is minimal. \nApplicant failed to indicate his current monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt \npayments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary \nspending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling. There is little evidence that since his SOR was issued in March 2018, \nApplicant has made any significant efforts to contact the vast majority of his creditors, \nenter into repayment plans with creditors, or make payments to creditors to resolve most \nof his delinquent or charged-off accounts, even to the smaller creditors to which he owes \n$195, $206, or $207. Other than his general statements about his future intentions, \nApplicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that \nit is now under control.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d13 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d14   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n                                                          \n11 Item 7, supra note 1, at 1. \n \n12 AE D (Scheduled Payments, dated July 5, 2018). \n \n13 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n14 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d15 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.16  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d17  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d18 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n15 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n16 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n17 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n18 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe SOR identified 20 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or repossessed, totaling $21,206. Nearly all of those delinquent accounts \ncontinue to be unaddressed and unresolved, despite Applicant being fully employed since \nFebruary 2017, and expecting salary increases. Applicant claimed that when he was \nunemployed in 2014, he was unable to make his required monthly payments, but it \nappears that he was simply content to remain unemployed for periods of time sufficient \nfor him to continue his education and draw unemployment benefits. Applicant\u2019s failure to \neven address the minor delinquent debts until after the SOR was issued seems to \nconstitute an unwillingness to satisfy his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been \nestablished.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;19 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;20 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \nmake it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it \nis \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to several periods of \nunemployment, and because he had endured some hardship, not otherwise described. \nIn addition, he was divorced in 2015. He had insufficient funds to maintain his financial \n                                                          \n19 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n20 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nresponsibilities. There is no documentation to reflect that Applicant obtained financial \ncounseling from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice; disputed his delinquent accounts with the credit reporting agencies or the \ncreditors themselves; contacted his creditors to set up repayment plans; or indicated that \npayments had been made to his creditors before the SOR was issued. Those few actions \nthat Applicant did make all commenced after the SOR was issued.21  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests.22 In this instance, to date, there are authorized weekly \n$100 payments to an identified collection agent, to commence two weeks after the SOR \nwas issued; one dispute filed that was associated with an unspecified account in May \n2018; an authorized payment to an identified creditor in June 2018; and two scheduled \npayments to an unidentified creditor in July 2018. Before the SOR was issued, Applicant \nsimply ignored his creditors. There is no evidence that any other corrective actions have \nbeen taken by Applicant. There is no evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s finances are \nunder control. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed sustained action, are insufficient.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                          \n21 See ISCR Case No. 12-01335 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). \n \n22 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.23  \n  \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 44-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a material specialist with \nhis current employer since February 2017. He has professed an intent to rectify his \ndelinquent debts within five years. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant exhibited a lack of candor when he completed his e-QIP and denied having any \nfinancial issues other than an eviction for unpaid rent and a credit card he claimed his ex-\nwife was supposed to pay. He actually had 20 delinquent accounts that had been placed \nfor collection, charged off, or repossessed, totaling $21,206. Nearly all of those delinquent \naccounts continue to be unaddressed and unresolved, despite Applicant being fully \nemployed since February 2017. Applicant has made minimal documented efforts to \nresolve his delinquent debts despite promising to do so. Applicant has not obtained \nfinancial counseling. There is no evidence of a budget, and he offered no evidence to \nindicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it is now under control. To the \ncontrary, a new non-SOR delinquent debt, an education loan with an unpaid balance of \n$5,941, was recently added to Applicant\u2019s portfolio of collections. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:24 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \n                                                          \n23 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n24 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, seemingly avoiding most, if not all, of the debts in his name. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.t.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Financial considerations and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.      \n  \nHistory of the Case \n \n \nOn October 4, 2016, Applicant completed and signed his SCA. (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) On April 19, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \n12/14/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR \nset forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. \n \nOn April 27, 2018, Applicant provided his first response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3) On June 1, 2018, the SOR was amended adding and \nclarifying allegations under the financial considerations guideline and adding an allegation \nunder the personal conduct guideline. (HE 2) On June 11, 2018, Applicant provided his \nresponse to the amended SOR. (HE 3) On June 11, 2018, Department Counsel was \nready to proceed. On July 30, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On August 15, 2018, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for September 6, 2018, using video teleconference. (HE 1) The hearing was \nheld as scheduled.  \n  \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits; there were no objections to the \ndocuments; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 10-15, 19-21; Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1-4) Applicant did not offer any exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 16) On September 12, \n2018, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, \n1.g, and 1.h.1 He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor in \nweapons installation since October 2016. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 2003, he received a General \nEducational Development (GED) diploma. (Tr. 6) He is currently seeking an associate\u2019s \ndegree in firearms technology. (Tr. 6-7) He served in the Navy from 2004 to 2013. (Tr. 7) \nHis Navy specialty was aviation ordnanceman, and his rank when he was discharged was \npetty officer second class (E-5). (Tr. 8) He received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 8)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant had variations in his income, and a period of unemployment after leaving \nthe Navy. These circumstances adversely affected his finances. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges \nthe following financial issues: \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.h allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, and 2014. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges he failed to pay his \nfederal income taxes as required for tax year 2013.  SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant failed \nto timely file his state income tax return for tax year 2011.  \n \n                                            \n1 As part of this SOR response, Applicant provided a copy of a federal tax lien filed against his \nfather to establish that it was not Applicant\u2019s tax lien. (Tr. 17-18) No adverse inference is made because of \nthis tax lien. \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nApplicant filed his federal income tax returns for each of these tax years as follows: \n2009 filed on January 27, 2011 (Tr. 22-23, 27-28; SOR response); 2011 filed in \nSeptember 2018; 2013 timely filed in April 2014 (Tr. 48; GE 2); and 2014 filed on July 21, \n2017 (Tr. 33).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s March 22, 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2013 indicates in \nFebruary 2016 he had additional taxes assessed of $5,007. (Tr. 34; GE 2) He explained \nthat he failed to include a withdrawal from his Thrift Savings Program account on his \nincome tax return resulting in additional taxes for \u201cunreported income.\u201d (Tr. 33; GE 2) His \nfederal income tax refund for tax year 2015 ($1,271) and 2016 ($1,593) were used to \naddress his delinquent taxes for tax year 2013. (Tr. 34; SOR response) The IRS \napparently waived some fees and charges because his 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax \nyear 2013 shows a zero pay off amount. (GE 2) A February 27, 2017 IRS letter also \nindicates his tax debt for tax year 2013 has a zero balance. (GE 2) His federal income tax \ndebt for tax year 2013 is resolved. \n \nApplicant was deployed as part of his Navy duties for most of 2010 and the first \nfew months of 2011. (Tr. 24, 26-27, 29; SOR response) He was waiting for the state to \nprovide a copy of his W-2 so he could file his state tax return for tax year 2011. (Tr. 25, \n30, 45) He was unable to get a W-2 from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n(DFAS). (Tr. 46) Applicant\u2019s state tax return has not been filed as of the date of his \nhearing. (Tr. 25, 45-46) \n \nApplicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008, 2010, \n2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (SOR response; GE 2) He received a refund for all of \nthese tax years. (SOR response; GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt owed to a credit union for \n$22,983. In 2012, Applicant borrowed funds to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 35) The vehicle \nwas not repossessed. (Tr. 38) He stopped making payments for a time, and then in \nSeptember 2017, he resumed making $200 monthly payments. (Tr. 35, 37) The account \nis in current status. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a charged-off debt for $7,245. From May 2017 to April 2018, \nApplicant paid the creditor $200 monthly, and then in April 2018, the creditor offered to \nsettle the remaining debt for $3,000. (Tr. 40-41) In April 2018, Applicant paid $3,000 and \nsettled the debt. (Tr. 41) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nWhen Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he \ndid not timely file his federal or state tax returns in 2011. Applicant said at the time he \ncompleted his SCA, he had forgotten that he did not timely file his tax returns. (Tr. 42-43)  \n \nOn November 16, 2017, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \nasked him during his personal subject interview (PSI) whether he failed to file or pay his \nfederal or state taxes. (Tr. 47; GE 2) Applicant disclosed that he did not timely file his \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nfederal income taxes for tax year 2013, and he said he paid his tax debt for that year in \nFebruary 2017. (Tr. 47; GE 2) He did not disclose that at the time of his PSI he failed to \nfile his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2011. At his hearing, he said he \ncould not remember why he did not disclose to the OPM investigator that he had not filed \nhis federal income tax return for tax year 2011. (Tr. 47; GE 2) 2 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \n                                            \n2 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to disclose that he failed to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax year 2011 to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-\n00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). This \nallegation will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns as required . . . .\u201d Applicant admitted that he failed to timely \nfile his federal tax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, and 2014 and state tax return for \n2011. His federal income taxes for tax year 2013 were not paid until 2017. He was late \npaying or making payment arrangements for two debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nThe Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;3   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n                                            \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in \norder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNo mitigating conditions apply; however, Applicant presented some mitigating \ninformation. He had variations in his income, and a period of unemployment after leaving \nthe Navy. These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and caused or \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. He established a payment plan to address \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He was deployed for most of \n2010, which delayed filing his tax return for tax year 2009. His federal income tax debt for \ntax year 2013 is paid. Applicant is credited with mitigating the financial allegations in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f.   \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 and \n2014. He failed to file his state income tax return for tax year 2011. The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has observed: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the \napplicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent \nsuch problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nsecurity worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \napproach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d \nanalysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus \non timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file his tax returns. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \n AG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, . . . \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .\u201d \n   \nWhen Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he \nfailed to timely file his federal or state tax returns in the previous seven years. At his \nhearing, Applicant said at the time he completed his SCA, he had forgotten that he did \nnot timely file his tax returns. This explanation is not credible.  AG \u00b6 16(a) is established \nfor his failure to disclose accurate information about filing his tax returns on his SCA.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides five conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nWhen Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he \nfailed to timely file his federal or state tax returns for tax year 2011 and his federal income \ntax return for tax year 2014. During his OPM PSI, he disclosed that he did not timely file \nor pay his federal income tax return for tax year 2013; however, he brought proof to the \ninterview that his federal tax debt for tax year 2013 was paid. At his hearing, he said he \ndid not remember that he failed to timely file tax returns for tax year 2011, and he said he \ncould not remember why he did not disclose to the OPM investigator that he had not filed \nhis federal income tax return for tax year 2011. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.   \n       \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor in \nweapons installation since October 2016. He is currently seeking an associate\u2019s degree \nin firearms technology. He served in the Navy from 2004 to 2013. His Navy specialty was \naviation ordnanceman, and his rank when he was discharged was petty officer second \nclass. He received an honorable discharge.   \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of failing to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2011 \nand 2014, and his state tax return for 2011, raises unresolved financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. He may owe state income taxes for tax year 2011.4 When an issue of \ndelinquent taxes is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an \napplicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS or a state generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments.5 The primary problem here is that Applicant has repeatedly been late \nfiling his tax returns. He did not provide a good reasons for not timely filing his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2014 and his state income tax return for tax \nyear 2011.  \n \n Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification of his SCA was in a security context, and that \nfalsification raises a serious security concern. The protection of national security relies on \nApplicants to self-report conduct that jeopardizes security, even when that disclosure \nmight damage the Applicant\u2019s career. AG \u00b6 15 emphasizes, \u201cOf special interest is any \nfailure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.\u201d Applicant cannot be trusted to disclose \npotentially derogatory information. He did not establish his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n \n \n                                            \n4See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d). \n \n5See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s \ncontrol adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s \nwages, and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and \ninsufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and \ncited applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

On \nAugust 10, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline E, personal conduct. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 13, 2018, with a detailed, eight-page \nanswer, admitting in part, and denying in part, the SOR allegations. He provided \nexplanations and several attachments to his answer including: five character reference \nletters; evaluation and counseling records; a letter from the county district attorney \nrejecting charges against Applicant; copies of numerous awards, certificates, and letters \n\n \n2 \n \n \nof appreciation and commendation. These were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \n\u2013 F and admitted without objection.  \n \n \nApplicant also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on January 25, 2019. On February 7, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nMarch 1, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. At the hearing, Applicant testified and his counsel submitted an additional \nperformance evaluation from his current employer, which was marked as AE G, and \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 11, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. (Tr. 26) He \nmarried in 2010 and divorced in 2012. He remarried in 2014 and divorced in 2016. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy in 2014 and finished first in his class at culinary specialist \nschool. He also received an accelerated promotion to petty officer, and awards including \nthe Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and a Surface Warfare Pin. \n(Tr. 29-30) He attached documents to his answer to the SOR including excellent \nperformance evaluations, letters of appreciation, and certificates of commendation for \nhis service in the Navy. (Tr. 16) He reports no children. Applicant has been employed as \na food runner at a hotel while awaiting the outcome of his application to be an Arabic \nspeaking linguist for a major federal contractor, which is contingent on obtaining his \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 24-25)  \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e. (Answer). He admitted \nin part, and denied in part, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, because he \nadamantly denies that he committed domestic assault or battery against his wife, and \nshe later recanted her allegations. The county district attorney dropped all charges \nagainst Applicant and the restraining order was rescinded. (AE D, Tr. 38-39)  \n \n Applicant testified that he received a general discharge, under honorable \nconditions as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e due to two events that occurred within 30 days of \neach other. (Tr. 22-23) The first incident, at the end of June 2016, occurred due to a \nmiscommunication between Applicant and his senior chief. (Tr. 32) Applicant had \nsubmitted a request to take 4-5 days annual leave to go home to assist his sister after \nher back surgery. (Tr. 33) Applicant had approved leave papers in hand. A week before \nhe departed the ship to go on leave, Applicant learned that his sister\u2019s surgery was \npostponed and he needed to request an additional day of leave. He did so, and \nreceived verbal authorization to simply extend his leave from his petty officer first class \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s April 25, 2017 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) and the summaries of his personal subject interviews (PSI) in May \n2017. (GE 1-2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(E-6) supervisor. (Tr. 34, 65) However, the first class failed to log this extension into the \nsystem.  \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he did not have sufficient time to submit a formal \nleave request in writing through his chain of command (COC) because several of his \nseniors were away on leave. (Tr. 47-48) Applicant accepts responsibility for this \nmistake, as he failed to follow up and ensure that the leave was formally recorded. (Tr. \n50, answer) When he returned from leave, he was charged with various Uniform Code \nof Military Justice (UCMJ) violations as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant went to \nnonjudicial punishment (NJP) for these offenses and he was sentenced to 30 days \nrestriction and extra duty and demoted in rank by one grade. (Tr. 35) In a statement on \nbehalf of Applicant, submitted at his NJP, the first class corroborated that he verbally \nauthorized the extension of leave, but he was overwhelmed with work, and forgot to log \nit. (Tr. 64)   \n \nApplicant denied in part the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d, which all \narose out of the second incident in July 2016. While he was serving his NJP sentence of \nrestriction to the ship, Applicant was enduring a very difficult time with his wife. One \nevening, he made repeated calls to his wife that went unanswered. (Tr. 35-36) His wife \nalso stopped responding to text messages. Applicant became extremely worried \nbecause of earlier text messages from her where she said she was having a very bad \nday. (Tr. 54) Previously she had a miscarriage while he was at sea. (Tr. 36) Applicant \nleft the ship without authorization, and he went to his nearby home to find his wife with \nan interloper. (Tr. 37-38) It was plain to see she was having an adulterous affair. \nApplicant was shocked and argued with his wife after the interloper departed. During the \nargument, she arose quickly from the couch, and he gently pushed her back with an \nopen hand, fearing that she was about to do something rash. (Tr. 38) She was not \ninjured. She called the police and he was arrested. (Tr. 38)  \n \nApplicant disclosed both of the afore mentioned incidents fully, as well as the \nresultant NJPs and General Discharge, in his April 2017 SCA. Following his arrest in \nJuly 2016, Applicant\u2019s wife became embarrassed and sorry for calling the police. (Tr. \n39) She convinced the prosecutors to dismiss all charges against Applicant, and she \nwithdrew the domestic violence restraining order alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d as frivolous. (AE \nD) He had a second NJP nonetheless, where he was sentenced to reduction in rank \nfrom E-4 (Petty Officer) to E-3 (Seaman), and 45 days restriction and extra duty. (Tr. 63) \nApplicant subsequently obtained an amicable divorce from his wife in December 2016. \n(Tr. 41)   \n        \n Applicant testified that he lost substantial Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \neducational and other benefits due to his General Discharge. (Tr. 74) He provided two \nexcellent performance evaluations for each year from 2014 to 2016. (AE B) He also \nprovided six favorable character reference letters from his supervisors and a colleague. \nOne was from Applicant\u2019s senior chief (E-8), who was the supervisor of the first class \nwho granted verbal authority to extend his leave. (AE A) They attest to Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter, integrity, honesty and work ethic. He also provided several letters of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nappreciation and certificates of commendation for his military service. I found his \ntestimony was direct and candid. \n \n \n \n                                   Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and \na careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching \nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and \nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \n The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes. The following \nnormally will result in an unfavorable national security eligibility \ndetermination, security clearance action, or cancellation of further \nprocessing for national security eligibility . . .  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified information. This \nincludes but is not limited to, considerations of: \n \n   \n   \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations \n \n Applicant admits to wrongfully leaving his ship without authorization, while he \nwas still on restriction, on the night when he discovered his wife cheating. He also takes \nresponsibility for not confirming that his verbally authorized extension of leave was \nformally entered into the unit\u2019s computer diary and properly approved. He was led to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nbelieve it had been approved after a discussion with a supervisor. The Government \nprovided substantial evidence of his rule violations on these occasions and his general \ndischarge. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3), are implicated and the focus shifts to a \ndetermination of which, if any, of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns  \n            Include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he was under a great deal of stress related to his \nmarriage when he left his ship without authority. He relied to his detriment on a \ncolleague, a petty officer first class, to enter the verbal extension in the unit diary. He did \nnot follow through and confirm that the extension had been properly granted. He pled \nguilty and accepted his NJP punishment although he appears to have had a valid \ndefense. He has already been punished for both transgressions by the Navy. He \nreceived two NJP punishments including loss of a stripe, restriction, and extra duty. \nAdditionally, because he had two disciplinary incidents so close in time in the summer of \n2016, the Navy gave Applicant a General Discharge under honorable conditions. He \nlost substantial Post-911 GI Education Bill benefits and his chosen career as a result. I \nfind that his transgressions were committed almost three years ago. They occurred \nunder unique circumstances of his wife\u2019s infidelity and such misconduct is unlikely to \nrecur. He has divorced his wife, left the Navy, volunteered to become a linguist, and \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate stressors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17 (c) and (d) apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG, Appendix A, \n\u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline.  \n \nApplicant disclosed his disciplinary problems in the Navy in his SCA and \nconcedes he made mistakes. He was already punished for those minor transgressions. \nHe wants to continue to serve DOD as an Arabic linguist for a contractor. His judgment \nno longer remains a security concern. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that his \npersonal relations are under control, and he will not repeat his previous misconduct. \nThe record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \npersonal conduct security concerns under Guideline E.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                                      FOR Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 2.e:                                       For Applicant  \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn March 2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), dated June 8, 2017.\n03/29/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 5, 2018, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to other judges on May 13, 2018 and July 13, 2018, respectively, and\nreassigned to me on January 9, 2019. The case was scheduled for hearing on February\n13, 2019. The Government\u2019s case consisted of five exhibits (GEs 1-5), which were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and 15 exhibits (AEs\nA-O), which were admitted without objection. The transcript was received on February 26,\n2019.  \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with documented responses from her\ncredit reporting agencies to her disputed accounts. For good cause shown, Applicant was\ngranted 30 days to supplement the record. (Tr. 80) Department Counsel was afforded five\ndays to respond.\nWithin the time permitted, Applicant provided eight separate documents that were\ncomprised of the following: excerpts from her 1099-Cs, proof of no collection accounts,\ndisputes and outcomes, comprehensive dispute history and outcomes, a personal\nstatement of Applicant, a student loan repayment plan, and additional letters of\nrecommendation. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted as AEs P-W \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 14 delinquent debts\nexceeding $134,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding.\nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the allegations in the\nSOR with explanations. She admitted SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.n and denied the allegations\ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.a for stated reasons that she is in full compliance with her loan\nmodification agreement of 2014. For the remaining debts, she claimed extenuating\ncircumstances associated with periods of unemployment and difficult circumstances\nduring the lengthy economic downturn beginning with the 2008 market crash.  She further\nclaimed that her remaining listed debts no longer appear on her 2018 credit report. She\nclaimed that she has received financial counseling on the debts in issue. And, she\nclaimed that she is honored to be working for her current employer and the Army as a\ncontractor.\n.\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old statistician for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance. Most of the allegations in the SOR were admitted by Applicant and are\nadopted as relevant and material findings. The remaining allegation is reserved for fact-\nfinding based on the developed evidence at hearing. Additional findings follow with\nrespect to Applicant\u2019s admitted allegations\n2\n\nBackground\nApplicant cohabits with her partner and has one child (age six months) from this\nrelationship. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 19) She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a prestigious private\nuniversity in foreign affairs and a master\u2019s degree in economics from a respected state\nuniversity in her former state of residence in December 2005. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G-I) She\nattended graduate classes in statistics from the same state university between January\n2014 and May 2016 but earned no degree or diploma. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G-I) Since\n2017, she earned a graduate certificate from an accredited state university in her current\nstate of residence and is 12 hours short of earning a master\u2019s degree from the same\nuniversity. (AEs G-I) Applicant reported no military service. \nSince January 2018, Applicant has worked full time as a statistician for her current\nemployer while she completes her graduate education studies. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G-H\nand U; Tr. 20) Between 2015 and 2017 she worked for a technical services company in\nher former state of residence as an analyst. (GE 1) Previously, she worked for other\nemployers in various technical capacities. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G-H and U) She held a\nsecurity clearance for a brief period in 2015 while she interned for the Army. (Tr. 21) For\nalmost several months (October 2012-January 2013), she was unemployed. (GEs 1-2)\nDuring this period of unemployment, she devoted her energies to the real estate business\nher parents started in her former state of residence and earned very little money (GE 1;\nTr. 21-24)  \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBetween 2006 and the present, Applicant has operated a residential property\nbusiness with her mother. Between 2006 and 2008, she and her mother purchased 11\nresidential properties (single family homes) in her prior state of residence that ranged in\nprice from $69,000 to $180,000. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 24-26, 47-48) Applicant financed their\npurchases primarily with mortgages in her name individually, with some initial\ncontributions from her mother who sold her home to help with the initial financing. (GEs 2-\n5; Tr. 25-26, 66-68, 70) In 2018, Applicant and her mother purchased a 12   home in her\nth\nprior state of residence and financed their purchase with a $64,000 mortgage. (GE 5; Tr.\n47) Applicant and her mother purchased these properties with the primary goal in mind of\nraising money for their retirement. (Tr. 25-26) All told, Applicant generated loan proceeds\nfor her residences totaling more than $1 million based on her sole credit. (GEs 2-5; Tr.\n26-27, 45-46) \nApplicant has consistently borne full responsibility for the financing and\nmanagement of the 12 properties she purchased with her mother. (Tr. 26) Credit reports\nand Applicant\u2019s payment history confirm that all of the residences are currently rented,\nand she is current with all of her mortgages. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 27-28, 46, 67) However, these\nproperties have little equity, and some are underwater according to Applicant. (Tr. 53-54) \nBesides the first mortgages on the 12 properties Applicant financed, Applicant\nsecured a second mortgage on one of her properties in the amount of $45,000 in 2006.\n3\n\n(GEs 2-5; Tr. 26-27, 70-71) The loan became delinquent in 2013 while Applicant was\nunemployed. (Tr. 28-29) After talking with the lender about her situation in 2014, she was\nable to obtain a loan modification on this loan that called for monthly loan payments of\n$100. (AE A; Tr, 29-30) Applicant documented monthly payments since 2014 in\ncompliance with her modification agreement. (AE A; Tr. 29-30, 70)\nBetween 2008 and 2013, Applicant struggled with her finances and used her credit\ncards to finance her household necessities and business expenses associated with her\nrental properties. (GEs 2-5 and AEs G-H and U; Tr. 23, 71) Altogether, Applicant\naccumulated over $134,000 in delinquent credit card debt during this 2008-2013 time\nframe. (GEs 2-5) Three  of the listed delinquent SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d) were canceled by\nthe common creditor following Applicant\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to dispute inaccuracies\nand work out payment arrangements for the balances owed on all three delinquent\naccounts.  (AEs B-D; Tr. 31-33) \nIn December 2017, the creditor for SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d issued 1099-C\ncancellation of debt notices for each of the debts that total approximately $21,000. (AEs\nB-D; Tr. 31-32) Applicant is in agreement that the debts covered by the cancellation of\ndebt notices for SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d were in default at the time the cancellation notices\nwere issued and had not previously been addressed by her. Because of the cancellation\nof the debts by the creditor for SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, federal taxes became due on the\n$21,000 in imputed income from the debt cancellations. Excerpts from Applicant\u2019s 2017\nfederal tax return document Applicant\u2019s inclusion of the imputed $21,000 as income from\nthe canceled debts. (AE P) Applicant, accordingly, is credited with including her\ncancellation of debts covered in AE F as imputed income in her 2017 federal income tax\nreturn. Whether she ultimately owed any taxes for tax year 2017 after accounting for\ndeductions is unclear. (AEs B-D and P; Tr. 33) \nApplicant, however, has not been able to address any of the remaining credit card\ndebts that exceed $99,000 in the aggregate. (GEs 2-5; Tr.33-39) Applicant disputed these\ndebts on grounds of inaccuracy (without disputing the entire amounts of the reported\ndebts), and they have since been removed from her 2018 credit reports. (GEs 2-3 and 5\nand AEs G-H; Tr. 39, 68-69) None of the removed debts, though, reflect documented\ndisputed amounts, and Applicant did not provide any corroborative proof of her dispute\nletters to the credit reporting agencies, who never responded to her. (GEs 2-5 and AEs E-\nF; Tr.33-39, 72-79) Because Applicant has produced no evidence of her addressing any\nof these SOR debts, the removal of these remaining consumer debts from her credit\nreports cannot reasonably be attributed to payment or successful dispute initiatives, as\nopposed to other reasons like payment satisfaction or the age of the debts. (Tr. 73-78)\nCurrently, Applicant has no specific plans in place to address any of her remaining\ndelinquent debts covered in the SOR. (Tr. 68)\nFor lack of sufficient income sources of her own and the economic unfeasibility of\nraising rents on any of the 12 properties she owns, Applicant has not been able to make\nany headway with her listed SOR debts and remains at risk to revenue setbacks on her\nreal estate should she encounter loss of tenants or other unanticipated real estate\n4\n\nexpenditures in the future. (Tr. 82-83) She has been a full-time student throughout 2017\nand 2018, while reportedly holding down a full-time position since 2018, and has not been\nin a position to work out any payment plans with her remaining creditors or pursue any\nrealistic opportunities to consolidate her debts. (GE 4 and AEs G-H and U; Tr. 39-41) \nTo her credit, Applicant enrolled in a financial credit counseling course in February\n2019 and earned a certificate of counseling in February 2019. (AE L) At the time of her\ncounseling, Applicant did not request a debt repayment plan preparation from her\ncounselor, and none was prepared. (AE L) From her counseling sessions, she acquired\nlessons about the importance of budgeting and staying within budget. (AE L; Tr. 83)  But\nwithout a payment plan or plans in place, predictable assessments of her ability to mount\nserious repayment efforts in the foreseeable future cannot be made.\nApplicant currently grosses about $106,000 a year based on her 2017 federal tax\nreturn and nets about $4,400 a month from her current employer and maybe $1,000 a\nmonth from her real estate investments. (AE P; Tr. 39-41) She has a 401(k) retirement\nplan with about $20,000 in the account. (Tr. 42) Significantly, she expressed no plans at\nthis time to use any of her monthly discretionary income to address any of her SOR\ndebts. Her repayment plans at this time, though, are limited to paying off the roughly\n$155,000 in aggregate student loans she has, once she completes her graduate studies,\nby setting aside $1,500 a month to pay off the loans. (AE V) \nCharacter references \nApplicant is well-regarded by friends, former colleagues and tenants, and\nprofessors who have interfaced academically in her current graduate program. (AEs K\nand W) All credit Applicant with loyalty, a strong work ethic, honesty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. \nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2\u00a9.\n5\n\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \n6\n\nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulated delinquent debt that\nshe has amassed over a five-year period (2008-2013) Altogether, Applicant accrued\nover $135,000 in delinquent debt, mostly from credit cards she used to finance her\nresidential properties and manage her home necessities. Most of her debts remain\nunresolved and outstanding.\nFinancial Concerns\n      Applicant\u2019s incurring of delinquent debts warrant the application of three of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d;\n19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt\ndelinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing delinquent debts is critical to an assessment\nof an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and\n7\n\nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a\nsensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR\nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited extenuating\ncircumstances (i.e., unemployment, the 2008 market crash, and her education\ncommitments) provide some mitigation credit for her failure to address her accrued\ndebts. Based on her cited circumstances, MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has some\napplication to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \nConsidering all of Applicant\u2019s  cited circumstances, the \u201cacting responsibly\u201d prong\nof  MC \u00b6 20(b) has only limited application and cannot excuse her past failures to\naddress her debts with evidence of payments and payment plans that reflect at least the\nbeginnings of a good track record of addressing her remaining consumer debts. Failure\nto make more good-fath efforts to address her remaining debts, precludes her from fully\navailing herself of the  benefits of MC \u00b6 20(b)  See ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 3-5\n(App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007)\n(citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005). For similar reasons, MC \u00b6\n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a  good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is not available to her.\nTo be sure, all of Applicant\u2019s remaining SOR debts have since been removed\nfrom her credit reports. Historically, removal of delinquent debts from an applicant\u2019s\ncredit reports has never been enough to satisfy the good-faith requirements for\nfavorably resolving the applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. \u201cThat some debts have dropped off\nhis or [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR case\nNo. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016)(citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 25, 2015) The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative\nfinancial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the\ndebt becoming collection-barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is\nlonger. See 15 U.S. \u00a7 1681c. And, in Applicant\u2019s case, she could not verify whether her\nremaining SOR debts were removed because of her dispute letter, or for some other\nreason. Removal of delinquent debts by themselves is not enough without other\nevidence of good-faith payment initiatives to favorably resolve raised debt issues.\nTo her credit, Applicant has made some progress with some of her debts. She is\nto be credited with keeping her real estate first mortgages in current status to date.\nCompliance with the terms of her modification agreement with creditor \u00b6 1.a and the\ncancellation of debts with SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d. and her ensuing inclusion of\nimputed income from these debt cancellations on her 2017 federal income tax return is\nworthy of credit to Applicant as well. In recognition of these combined efforts, she is\nentitled to partial application of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d of the financial\nguideline.  Only partial benefit of MC \u00b6 20(c)  \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving\nfinancial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a\nnon-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is\n8\n\nbeing resolved or is under control.\u201d For while the counseling was of meaningful benefit\nto her in improving her understanding of the importance of budgeting and managing her\nfinances generally, she has not been able to use the counseling to make further gains in\nresolving her remaining SOR debts.  \nFor lack of documented corroboration, other potentially applicable mitigating\nconditions are not available to Applicant. Application of MC  \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d requires documentation of\nApplicant\u2019s reasonable dispute requests to the credit reporting agencies, which\nApplicant could not provide. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, her failure to demonstrate more concerted steps in resolving her\nSOR debts, a necessary beginning to stabilizing her finances consistent with clearance\neligibility criteria, is concerning. Her accumulated delinquent debt accruals and\nheightened leveraging risks associated with her real estate portfolio place her at\nconsiderable disadvantage in her ongoing efforts to bring her finances under control.\nTaken together, her modest efforts to date in addressing her remaining SOR debts are\nnot enough at this time to warrant favorable findings and conclusions with respect to\nraised security concerns about her finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. She has shown\ninsufficient  progress to date in addressing her remaining SOR-listed debts, even with\nher increased discretionary income. While her payment efforts associated with her\nmortgage debts, and to a lesser extent, her honoring of her tax obligations in connection\nwith her three SOR debt cancellations, merit positive credit.\nApplicant\u2019s general contributions to the U.S. defense effort through her Army\nintern service and her statistical work are considerable and merit a good deal of respect\nand appreciation. The endorsements she has received from former colleagues, \ntenants, and her former graduate school professor reflect positive on her overall loyalty,\nhonesty, reliability and trustworthiness. And, most importantly, the achievements she\nhas established in her academic pursuits are impressive and will serve her well in her\nchosen field of statistics. But at this time, though, her positive credits are insufficient to\nsurmount historical trust and judgment issues associated with her debt accumulations\nand inability to manage her finances in a sound and prudent manner, consistent with\nmeeting the high standards set for approval of eligibility to hold a security clearance.\n9\n\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing her finances reflect too little\nevidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable\ndoubts about her trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information\nor occupy a sensitive position. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that her\nfinances are insufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements\nfor holding a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions are entered with respect to\nthe allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.n. Favorable conclusions are entered for SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d.  Eligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and circumstances of\nthis case is inconsistent with the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \n             Subparagraphs 1.e-1.n:\n                          Against Applicant\n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:                             For Applicant\n  \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\nhold a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 2, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 9, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2018.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 7, 2018, scheduling the hearing for January 11, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthough E. The record was left open until January 25, 2019, and Applicant timely submitted \n02/22/2019\n\n \n2 \n \na packet of documents, which was marked as AE F, and was accepted into the record \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 23, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 44, is single. She obtained her associate\u2019s degree in 2000, and has \nbeen studying for her undergraduate degree for a few years. She is not attending classes \nat this time.  She is a senior administrative assistant for a defense contractor. Applicant \ncompleted her security clearance application (SCA) on March 28, 2016. (GE 1) She has \nheld a security clearance for about 12 years. (GE 1) She has worked for her current \nemployer since June 2018. She previously worked as a contractor since about 2005. (Tr. \n18) \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a through 1.n, 14 delinquent debts totaling about $34,000, \nwhich include four student loan accounts, charged-off consumer accounts, and medical \naccounts. (GE 2-4) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and provided explanations for \neach one. (Answer) \n \nFINANCIAL \n \nApplicant acknowledged her financial hardship, and explained that she believed \nher finances were under control when she submitted her SCA, but explained that six knee \nsurgeries, other medical issues in 2016 through 2018, including a back surgery, 2016 \nsexual assaults in the workplace, and lost days of paid employment for months resulted \nin her current delinquent debt. (Tr. 8) Applicant missed many days of employment due to \nthe workplace issue and did not have a full paycheck for about one and a half years. \nApplicant was unemployed when she left the workplace after the late 2016-2017 sexual \nassaults and took a reduction in pay in her next job. (Tr. 22) She has spoken to a \nbankruptcy attorney, but she does want to pay her debts. (Tr. 9) She is in the process of \nconsolidating student loans. \n \nApplicant recounted how the sexual assaults at work led to depression and \nbecause she was afraid to report the incidents to her employer, she would take sick days \nmaybe one or two days a week. (Tr. 21-24) She spoke to an attorney and had a case \nworker and found the experience traumatic. Her emotional instability prevented her from \nconcentrating on her finances. This was the time period of 2016-2017 before she looked \nfor other employment. She knows that she has to take full responsibility for the financial \nsituation.  \n \nApplicant has paid the following SOR accounts: 1.j, an account in the amount of \n$581; 1.e, an account in the amount of $1,126; 1.f, a medical account in the amount of \n$245; 1.g, a medical account in the amount of $103; 1.h, a collection account in the \namount of $89; 1.i, a medical account in the amount of $181; and 1.n, a phone account \nin the amount of $202. (AE D-F) \n \nApplicant has the following SOR accounts in a payment plan: 1.a, a charged-off \naccount in the amount of $11,215 that has a term of 45 monthly payments of $250. (AE \n\n \n3 \n \nA) SOR 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $5,536 that has a term of 44 monthly \npayments of $125. (AE B) Applicant has made one or two payments on each account, \nbut did not provide documentation.  \n \nAs to the student loans at issue, SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.k, and 1.l, Applicant believes they \ntotal about $25,000. (Tr. 32) She started making payments on the loans but stopped in \n2016. (Tr.32)  Her student loans are not in deferment as she is not taking any classes. \nApplicant\u2019s intention was to return to class, but that did not occur.  She has been in contact \nwith the Department of Education and is in the process of arranging a payment plan that \nshe can afford. At the present time, she cannot afford the offered $700 a month. A \ncollection agency now is handling the loans and Applicant has been in touch with them \nand hoping for a $300 a month payment. This has not been approved. (Tr. 35)  \n \nApplicant admitted that she was indebted to a state university for a registered class \nthat she did not take and did not timely withdraw. (SOR 1.m) The amount owed is $1,797. \nShe explained that she has not attempted to resolve this account. She explained that \nthere were times when she was depressed that she did not open her mail. (Tr. 42) \n \nApplicant is working with her father to develop a budget and a strategy to handle \nher finances. She earns about $70,000 a year and lives with her two brothers. She has \nno new delinquent debt and no car loan.  Applicant has also spoken to the collection \nagent for the student loans concerning financial counseling. She has a monthly net \nremainder of about $365 after expenses. She has health insurance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are the result of many surgeries, medical problems, \nunemployment, and workplace sexual assaults in a particular period of time. She attended \nclasses and obtained school loans but has not been financially able to begin a \nconsolidation payment plan. These events were beyond her control and do not cast doubt \non her trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established.    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.  Applicant\u2019s unemployment, health issues, and \nmedical problems, and other issues were beyond her control, and she has acted \nresponsibly recently toward the majority of her smaller delinquent debts, with the \nexception of the student loans and state university account. She has only recently \nestablished two payment plans and made only one or two payments. She has not \nproduced sufficient information to show that she has been proactive in her actions. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not fully established. Applicant did not produce evidence \nof any financial counseling nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is \nunder control. She has not been able to consolidate her student loans and owes money \nto a state university. She has recently started payment plans but has only made one or \ntwo payments on each. She has made strides, but her financial problems are not under \ncontrol.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including her credibility and openness at the hearing. Applicant had \ncircumstances that occurred beyond her control and she has made strides in rectifying \nher financial situation. However, at this time, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-j: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

He also used \nvarious other illegal drugs. In 1999, while serving in the U.S. military, he tested positive \nfor marijuana and cocaine. He received non-judicial punishment and an other than \nhonorable conditions (OTHC) discharge from the service. In March 2005, he was charged \nwith conspiracy and homicide. He mitigated the Guideline J, criminal conduct security \nconcerns. However, he failed to mitigate the Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, security concerns, due to the recency of his marijuana use and his \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nActing under the relevant Executive Order and Department of Defense (DoD) \nDirective, on May 21, 2018, the DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H and Guideline J.  \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017 pertain to this decision. \n\n   \nOn June 5, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nNovember 26, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing that was amended on December \n6, 2018, scheduling a hearing that was conducted on December 12, 2018.  \n \n \n2 \n \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 5) were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant submitted no exhibits. Documents submitted by Applicant as \nattachments to his SOR response were considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on January 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted, with explanation, that he used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about April 2012 to at least June 2016. He admitted \nthe other illegal drug use alleged in the SOR. He admitted being discharged from the U.S. \nmilitary for drug use and being charged with criminal conspiracy and homicide. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \nApplicant is 41 years old and works with technical orders and laptops for a defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 21) He is not married and has no children. (Ex. 1, Tr. 22) From July 1996 \nthrough February 1999, Applicant served in the U.S. military. (Ex. 1) In 1999, he tested \npositive for marijuana and cocaine. He received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 \nof the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). (Ex. 2) He was separated with an OTHC, \nwhich is the most severe form of administrative discharge. (Tr. 62) He listed his discharge \nin his August 2016 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Ex. \n1) \n \nIn 1990, at age 12, Applicant\u2019s parents sent him to a two-week drug rehabilitation \nprogram after they discovered him with a bottle of chopped-up ibuprofen. They believed \nthe bottle contained a different drug. (Ex. 2) He asserts he was discharged from the clinic \nbecause he did not have a drug problem and his parents had sent him to the clinic as a \nform of punishment.  \n \nAlso in 1990, Applicant started smoking marijuana. (Tr. 22) From 1990 through \nJune 2016, he used marijuana. (Ex. 2, Tr. 6) At times not identified in the record, he sold \nmarijuana to his friends weekly or every couple of weeks. (Tr. 60) In 2009 or 2010, he \nstopped selling marijuana. (Tr. 44, 61) Between January 1999 and October 2008, he used \ncocaine seven times. From September 2011 until August 2013, he used \nmethamphetamine, and from November 2013 through February 2014, he used diazepam \nthree or four times a week. (Ex. 2, Tr. 53, 59) He used the diazepam to help him sleep \nbecause he had bad tooth pain. (Ex. 2) He obtained the drug from a friend who had a \nprescription for the drug. (Ex. 2) In October 2002, he used illegal mushrooms once a week \nfor three weeks. He used LSD four times in November and December 1998. (Ex. 2, Tr. 6) \nHe did not list any of his drug use on his August 2016 e-QIP. (Ex. 1) \n\n   \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2018 response to written interrogatories, he provided the \nfollowing information concerning his future intentions of drug use: \n \n3 \n \n \n \nAs of June of 2016, the use of drugs has not been an issue for me, I have \nbeen doing [a] study on drugs and the implications and effect that it can \nhave on a person\u2019s life. And the physical harm that drugs can do to an \nindividual\u2019s health. I believe in this time in my life, I can say the abuse of \ndrugs is no longer a choice of entertainment. And I have focused my energy \non more important things in my life . . .  I have a whole new perspective on \nlife, and plan on using it to obtain a sound mind and body.\u201d (Ex. 2)  \n \nAt the hearing, when Applicant was asked why he stopped using marijuana he \nstated, \u201cI just stopped randomly . . . I don\u2019t know [why I stopped] I just \u2013 no reason.\u201d (Tr. \n46) He has not undergone any drug treatment, rehabilitation, or assistance program. (Tr. \n46) None of his friends or family abuse drugs. (Tr. 55) He testified, \u201cso getting involved in \ndrugs would not be a very wise decision on my part.\u201d (Tr. 56) He hopes to further his \neducation by attending college. (Tr. 55)  \n \nAt the hearing, when Applicant was asked to provide a reason why he would not \nstart using in the future he stated: \n \nWell, I couldn\u2019t tell you that I wouldn\u2019t use in the future. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t \nknow anything about the future. I know right now I\u2019m not using. To me \nmarijuana is not a big deal, but like you said earlier, the federal Government \nlooks at it as it\u2019s bad . . . I can\u2019t promise you that I wouldn\u2019t do it again, if \nthat is what you\u2019re saying. I don\u2019t know if I would or not. (Tr. 47)  \n \nIn June 2005, at age 26, Applicant was involved in a murder. The victim and all \nothers involved lived within a few blocks of each other. Court documents indicate the \nvictim had been good friends with two of the individuals involved in the killing until June \n2004. (Ex. 4) The victim had previously dated the sister of one of the individuals convicted \nof killing him. The breakup caused \u201cbad blood\u201d between the victim and his prior friends \nrelated to the sister. (Tr. 28-29) Acrimony between the individuals and the victim \nincreased in the month prior the murder. (Tr. 29) The victim and one of the two individuals \nconvicted of killing him had previously been in a fistfight. (49)  \n \nApplicant was sitting around drinking and using illegal drugs with four friends. As \na group they agreed to go to the victim\u2019s house, without firearms, and beat up the victim. \n(Tr. 30, 31) Applicant accompanied his friends to what he was believed would be a \nfistfight. An altercation occurred, and Applicant was returning to the car when a friend in \nthe group pulled a shotgun from his pants and killed the victim. (Tr. 61)  \n \nApplicant and the others were arrested. From March 2005 through March 2006, \nApplicant remained in jail awaiting trial. (Ex. 2, Tr. 38) He was charged with first degree \nmurder, conspiracy, and the lesser charges of second degree murder and involuntary \n\n   \n \n4 \n \n \nmanslaughter. (Ex. 2, Ex. 3) Two individuals in the group were convicted of murder, one \nwas convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and Applicant and another were found not \nguilty. (Tr. 62) Being acquitted, he was never placed on probation or parole. (Tr. 62) \nApplicant has not seen or had any communication with any of the other individuals \ninvolved in the murder since seeing them in court in 2006. (Tr. 40, 57) He did not list his \narrest or charges on his August 2016 e-QIP. (Ex. 1)  \n \nIn December 2011, Applicant was charged with being under the influence of a \ncontrolled substance. He did not list the charges on his e-QIP. (Ex. 1, Ex. 3) The evening \nhad started with him and friends drinking and smoking methamphetamine. (Ex. 2, Tr. 41) \nApplicant explained things began to \u201cget weird.\u201d When Applicant saw one of his friends \nwith a baseball bat, he quickly left the residence and ran to a fast-food restaurant. (Tr. 41) \nThe police arrived at the fast-food restaurant and took him to the police station where a \ndrug urinalysis was conducted. (Ex. 2) He was placed in a holding cell for six to eight \nhours and released in the following morning. (Tr. 41) When he went to court, the charge \nof being under the influence of a controlled substance was dropped. (Tr. 42)  \n \nApplicant denies any intention to use illegal drugs in the future, stating he had \u201ca \nwhole new perspective on life and plan on using it to maintain a sound mind and body.\u201d \n(Tr. 56) However, he would not make an unequivocal statement that such use would \nnever occur in the future. (Tr. 56)  \n \nCharacter reference \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin states that since Applicant moved to his current state, he is a \nquiet, intelligent, capable, honest and trustworthy individual. He is dedicated to his job \nand leads a responsible lifestyle. (SOR Response) A retired Air Force chief master \nsergeant states Applicant takes pride in job accomplishment and understands the need \nto protect information with which he is entrusted. (SOR Response) Applicant\u2019s immediate \nsupervisor states Applicant is eager to learn new jobs, quick to volunteer, performs all \ntasks in a timely manner, is very knowledgeable of his responsibilities, and is someone \nwho strives to and desires to live a wholesome life. (SOR Response) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \n\n   \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighting \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n\n   \n \n6 \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n  \nApplicant first used marijuana at age 12 and last used it in June 2016, which was \nover a span of 28 years. On occasion until 2009 or 2010, he sold marijuana. He used a \nvariety of other illegal drugs including: cocaine, methamphetamine, mushrooms, LSD, \nand diazepam. His 1999 positive urinalysis resulted in non-judicial punishment and \nseparation from the military with an OTHC discharge. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \n\u201cany substance misuse,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for an illegal drug,\u2019\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c), \n\u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and \nAG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Given he used marijuana over some 28 \nyears to as recently as June 2016, it cannot reasonably be said that his marijuana use \nhappened so long ago or was \u201cso infrequent\u201d to trigger AG \u00b6 26(a) in mitigation. His use \nof other illegal drugs was infrequent and the most recent use of the other illegal drugs \nwas February 2014, almost five years before the hearing. He has established a pattern \nof abstinence related to his use of the other illegal drugs sufficient to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns related to those other drugs.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) has some applicability because Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement and there is no evidence that he currently associates with drug-using \nassociates and contacts. AG \u00b6 26(b) provides: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nApplicant failed to list his illegal drug involvement on his August 2016 e-QIP. He \nhad last used marijuana two months prior to completing the e-QIP. At his hearing, \nApplicant when asked about future use of illegal drugs, he stated he would not say he \n\n   \nwould not use marijuana in the future. He was not currently using marijuana, but would \nnot promise he would not use it again. His statement raises doubt about his commitment \nand ability to abstain from future usage.  \n \n7 \n \n \n \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s present abstinence of two and a half years, as of the close of the \nevidentiary record, is very short in comparison to the 28 years over which he used \nmarijuana. He provided no corroborating evidence from others attesting to his change to \na drug-free lifestyle. Applicant has yet to establish a sufficient pattern of abstinence to \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns caused by his \nmarijuana usage in disregard of Federal law.  \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \n \nIn 1999, while serving in the U.S. military, Applicant received non-judicial \npunishment after testing positive for marijuana and cocaine in a urinalysis. As a result, he \nwas separated from the military with an OTHC discharge. In March 2005, he was charged \nwith criminal conspiracy and homicide. In December 2011, he was charged with being \nunder the influence of a controlled substance. He sold marijuana until 2009 or 2010. The \naforesaid conduct and charges establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n\n   \n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(e): discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less \nthan \u201cHonorable.\u201d \n \n \nThe criminal conduct security concerns have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factor: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nIn June 2005, 13 years ago when Applicant was 26 years old, he accompanied a \ngroup of friends to what he thought would be a fist fight. The altercation resulted in the \ndeath of an individual. Applicant was in jail from March 2005 through March 2006, \nawaiting trial. At trial, he was acquitted of all charged against him. He has not seen or had \nany communication with any of the other individuals involved in the murder since seeing \nthem in court in 2006. He has not sold marijuana in nine or ten years. His 2011 arrest for \nbeing under the influence of a controlled substance occurred seven years ago, and the \ncharges were dismissed. His discharge from the military occurred almost 20 years ago. \nNone of these events are recent. There was no showing of recent criminal misconduct.  \n \n \nThere has been a passage of time sufficient to conclude that his questionable \njudgment and criminal misconduct will not recur. Although charged with criminal conduct, \nApplicant was never convicted of a crime. Non-judicial punishment is not equivalent to a \nconviction.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \n\n   \n \n9 \n \n \nGuidelines H and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was charged but never convicted of a crime. The underlying conduct \nleading to criminal charges being filed, his non-judicial punishment, his OTHC discharge, \nand 2005 homicide charge were carefully reviewed. His acquittal of the homicide and the \npassage of time mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. However, the drug \ninvolvement was not mitigated.  \n \nThe Government must be able to rely on those persons seeking security clearance \neligibility to comply with the Federal drug laws without regard to their personal interests. \nFor the reasons discussed, Applicant has raised enough doubt in that regard to where I \nam unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for a security clearance. \n \nThe decision to deny a clearance at this time should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of true reform and \nrehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance in the future. The \nawarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on \napplying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under \nApplicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not recommended, but should Applicant \nbe afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. Favorable consideration \nwould be given to additional months without any evidence of misconduct or illegal drug \nusage. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted. \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct. \nHowever, insufficient time as pass since his last marijuana use to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement  \nAnd Substance Misuse:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant.  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u20131.g:   \n \nFor Applicant.  \n \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct:     \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n   \n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

However, \nhe used poor judgment by not complying with the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence in mitigation does not overcome the lingering security concerns under the \nguideline for financial considerations. Eligibility for security clearance access is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 23, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to apply for a security clearance required for a \nposition with a defense contractor. On December 15, 2017, Applicant provided an \ninterview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings necessary to \ngrant a security clearance. DOD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nMarch 8, 2018, detailing security concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline \n\n \n  2 \n \nF). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs). The guidelines \nare applicable to all individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The AGs were made \neffective on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on March 26, 2018, and requested a \nhearing. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on September 5, 2018, for a hearing on October 30, 2018. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government\u2019s seven exhibits (GE) 1-7 and Applicant\u2019s 7 \nexhibits (AE) A-G were admitted without objection. The Government\u2019s discovery letter, \ndated April 18, 2018, which had been marked as GE 8, is remarked as Hearing exhibit \n(HE) 1. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 7, 2018. The record in this \ncase closed the same day.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s December 2017 PSI (GE 2), I advised him that the PSI \nmay not be entered into evidence without an authenticating witness. Alternatively, I \nadvised him that he could have a recess to review the December 2017 PSI for \ninconsistencies. He replied that he had no objection to the PSI\u2019s entry into evidence. AE \n2 was admitted into evidence. (Tr. 30-31) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR lists three allegations under the financial considerations guideline: SOR \n1.a - Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016; SOR 1.b - a \ndelinquent credit union debt; and SOR 1.c \u2013 a delinquent medical debt. Applicant \nadmitted the three allegations and provided explanations. \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and divorced. Since 1999, he has been earning college \ncredits and is one course short of receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree. He served in the \nUnited States (US) Navy from March 2000 to March 2004, receiving an honorable \ndischarge. Applicant has been continually employed from 2005 to the present. During \nthat time, he has received several training certificates in connection with his \nemployment. Since June 2007, Applicant has been working in communication security \nfor several different defense contractors. He has no issues with his security clearance \nwhich he has held since 2000. (GE 1 at 10-11, 11-13, 17-18, 41; Tr. 56-60, 62) \n \n \nIn December 2013, Applicant purchased a home (HX) for $420,000 in his name, \nthough his then-girlfriend provided unexplained financial help with the purchase. He \n\n \n  3 \n \nfinanced the entire amount of the purchase with a Veterans Affairs (VA) loan at a fixed \ninterest rate. His then-girlfriend paid the utilities and food, and Applicant paid the \nmortgage and insurance. At the time of the purchase of HX, Applicant was renting out a \ntownhouse (not listed in the SOR) that he had purchased in 2005. After his girlfriend left \nhim in March 2014, Applicant had trouble managing all the financial responsibilities of \nHX. His financial problems increased in December 2014 or January 2015, when his \nrenters moved out of the townhouse and Applicant was unable to rent the property. \nAfter the first and second mortgages on the townhouse became delinquent, he sold the \ntownhouse in a short-sale. The resulting deficiency balance after the short-sale was \nforgiven by the mortgage lender. (GE 1 at 42; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 50, 65-69) \n \n \nSOR 1.a \u2013 Following his March 2014 breakup, and losing the renters of his \ntownhouse, Applicant began misusing credit cards to supplement his income so he \ncould pay bills. In September 2016, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, \nlisting $457,000 in liabilities and assets of $390,580. He included HX ($420,000) in the \nChapter 13 petition, along with a car loan, utility accounts, medical accounts, and two \nfederal credit union accounts. One of the credit union accounts was a credit card (SOR \n1.b), and one was a personal loan (unlisted). The payment terms of the plan were: $325 \na month for the first 14 months; $400 a month for months 15 through 17; and $965 a \nmonth for 43 months for a total of 60 months. The payment plan began in October 2016. \nIn June 2017, he moved out of HX and rented the property for $3,000 a month until \nJune 2018. The Chapter 13 petition plan was confirmed in September 2017. (GE 2 at 6-\n7; GE 5 at 13; Tr. 72, 75) \n \n \nApplicant testified that in September 2018, HX was placed under contract for a \nshort-sale. The contract price was $420,000, and Applicant owed $428,000 on the \nmortgage. He indicated that the buyer requested a 60-day approval process. Applicant \ncontacted the mortgage lender on October 29, 2018, and was told they were waiting on \nan unidentified document. He did not have a set date for finalization of the short-sale, \nbut assumed it would be before December 2018. There are several emails between the \nrealtor and Applicant, but no emails showing that the mortgage lender finalized the \nshort-sale, or that the process would be completed before December 2018. (AE C; Tr. \n52-53) \n \n \nAlthough Applicant claimed that he decided to place HX on the market shortly \nafter he filed the Chapter 13 petition in September 2016, all documentation related to \nhis efforts to sell HX occurred in 2018. Applicant seemed to modify his earlier decision \nto sell by indicating that he wanted to exhaust all avenues to keep HX. One of those \navenues was to acquire tenants (which he did between June 2017 and June 2018) for \nHX to generate extra money to pay bills and meet the Chapter 13 plan payments. (Tr. \n88-89)  \n \n \nOn October 4, 2018, the Chapter 13 trustee filed a Motion to Dismiss the Chapter \n13 Petition and Notice of an Opportunity for a Hearing. The trustee indicated that \nApplicant had defaulted on $2,850 in plan payments. Applicant admitted that he missed \n\n \n  4 \n \ntwo plan payments. Also, Applicant failed to provide the trustee a copy of his 2016 and \n2017 federal tax returns as required by the terms of the Chapter 13 order. Applicant was \ngiven until October 25, 2018, to provide a responsive pleading to the trustee\u2019s motion, \ntogether with a request for a hearing, or the case could be dismissed on October 25, \n2018. The record contains no documentation of a response by Applicant to the motion. \n(GE 5 at 11; GE 7) \n \nThe Chapter 13 payment history, which appears at the last page of the October \n2018 motion to dismiss, lists the payments Applicant made (and missed) between \nOctober 2016 and September 2018. Applicant attributed the missed payments to \noversight. In addition, he complained to his bankruptcy lawyer that the payment plan \namounts remained at the same level even after the renters of HX between June 2017 \nand June 2018, moved out in June 2018. Without the rental income, it was more difficult \nto make the higher plan payments. Applicant made the $965 payment on October 25, \n2018. (GE 7; Tr. 80-87, 93, 97) \n \n \nThough Applicant provided no documentation, he testified that a hearing date on \nthe motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was scheduled for December \n2018. He plans to have the short-sale of HX finalized before the hearing. Then, his \nbankruptcy attorney can inform the bankruptcy court that HX is no longer a liability and \nshould be removed from the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 91-92) \n \nSOR 1.b \u2013 This credit card account that Applicant opened in 2012, became \ndelinquent in August 2016. The account is past due in the amount of $4,449, with a total \nbalance of $11,678. The account is listed in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \n(AE E; Tr. 94) \n \n \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This medical account ($1,880) became delinquent in 2017 and was \nplaced for collection. Applicant\u2019s documentation shows that he made a payment of $103 \nin May, $216 in August, and $216 in October 2018. In the future, Applicant intends to \nuse the creditor\u2019s website to make future payments. Besides the accounts listed in \nSOR, Applicant has an unlisted delinquent cell phone bill amounting to $670. The bill \nrepresents an outstanding balance with his former service provider that his new service \nprovider promised to pay when he switched service. (AE B; Tr. 97-102)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s budget since August 2018 has a net monthly remainder of $470 a \nmonth. His savings account is depleted to about $200 after he paid a $1,000 home \nowners association bill. He exhausted his retirement account in 2014. He has only one \ncorporate credit card which he uses on work trips. Applicant has had no additional \nfinancial counseling since the mandated counseling he received when he filed his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016. (GE 1 at 43; AE A; Tr. 102-107) \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCharacter Evidence \n  5 \n \n \n \nThe audit chief for a branch of a federal agency has known Applicant for a long \ntime as an employee and does not believe he is a security risk. He should be allowed \ntime to resolve his mishandling of unidentified financial matters. (AE F) The branch chief \nfor the same federal agency as the audit chief indicated that he has known Applicant for \n14 years and states that Applicant is not a security risk. Applicant counseled with the \nbranch chief about filing bankruptcy in August 2016. The branch chief advised him to \ninform his facility security officer and disclose everything about the process. (AE G)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n \n  6 \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016, claiming \n$457,000 in liabilities and $390,580 in assets (SOR 1.a). Most of the liability is from HX. \nThe delinquent credit union credit card debt (SOR 1.b) is included in the Chapter 13 \npetition. The delinquent medical debt, which is outside of the Chapter 13 petition, is set \nforth at SOR 1.c. The failure of Applicant to comply with all terms of the Chapter 13 \norder, invoke the application following disqualifying conditions under of AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nIn March 2014, four months after Applicant and his former girlfriend purchased \nHX, she broke up with him, shifting all HX financial responsibilities to Applicant. In \nDecember 2014, his renters vacated his townhouse. Applicant successfully sold the \ntownhouse in a short-sale. The resulting deficiency balance was forgiven by the \nmortgage lender. The mitigation available under AG \u00b6 20(b) is reduced by the passage \nof more than three years since the foregoing events. \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanations of oversight and a high payment plan schedule are not \ncredible. The oversight explanation does not make sense given Applicant\u2019s testimonial \nclaim of exploring all avenues to try to save HX. If he was as focused as he claims in \nkeeping HX, it was essential for him to conscientiously meet all payments under the \nChapter 13 plan, or seek a payment plan modification through his bankruptcy attorney \nand the bankruptcy trustee. His complaint of an excessive payment schedule is not \ncredible given the fact that he was on notice when he began making payments under \n\n \n  7 \n \nthe Chapter 13 petition in 2016 that his payments would reach $965 a month in the 18th \nmonth of the payment plan.  \n \n \nOn October 4, 2018, the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to dismiss the Chapter \n13 case because Applicant missed $2,850 in payments since the inception of the \nChapter 13 plan in September 2016. Further, Applicant did not provide a copy of his \n2016 and 2017 federal tax returns as required by the order confirming the Chapter 13 \nplan. Applicant was given until October 25, 2018, to provide a responsive pleading to \nthe trustee\u2019s motion, together with a request for a hearing, or the case could be \ndismissed. Except for an unsubstantiated claim that a hearing was scheduled in \nDecember 2018, Applicant provided no testimony or documentation showing that he \nreplied to motion to dismiss. He provided no evidence of how he intends to address the \n$2,850 deficiency balance. Though Applicant receives mitigation credit under AG \u00b6 \n20(c) for receiving mandated financial counseling, there remains a real possibility that \nthe Chapter 13 petition could be dismissed. The mitigation due Applicant under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is tarnished by the lack of a consistent track record of payments ordered by the \nbankruptcy court under Chapter 13 payment plan.  \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s evidence of a predicted short-sale of HX, there is no set \ndate for finalization of the short-sale, even though Applicant assumed it would be before \nthe December 2018 hearing on the motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. \nIn sum, without evidence of finalization of a short-sale of HX, the action that Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy attorney intends to take to modify the Chapter 13 petition by removing HX, \nthereby eliminating a substantial amount of liability, rests on speculation rather than \nevidence.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI have examined the evidence under the guidelines for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n  8 \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and divorced. He is one course short of receiving his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He received an honorable discharge from the US Navy after serving \nfrom March 2000 to March 2004. Applicant has held a security clearance since 2000. \nHe has received several training certificates related to his employment in \ncommunication security. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence from the \naudit and branch chief of the federal agency where Applicant has worked for 14 years. \nHe has been employed consistently since 2005. I have considered the good judgment \nApplicant exercised in filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016 and \nlisting the SOR 1.b credit card debt in the petition.  \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant used poor judgment by not complying with the \nterms of the of the Chapter 13 payment plan. First, he did not provide copies of his \nfederal tax returns for 2016 and 2017 to the bankruptcy trustee as required by the \nChapter 13 order. Second, he has not fully complied with the payment plan set forth in \nthe Chapter 13 order. The $2,850 in missed payments was sufficient to convince the \nbankruptcy trustee to move for a dismissal of the full Chapter 13 petition. Third, \nApplicant provided no testimony or documentary evidence of a responsive pleading to \nthe motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 case. Applicant\u2019s documentation of a short-sale \ncarries little weight as there is no documentary evidence showing that the short-sale has \nbeen finalized. The short-sale is pending and the subsequent action to seek a \nbankruptcy court modification of the Chapter 13 petition is conditioned upon the \nfinalization of the short-sale. Neither event has occurred. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply \nwith bankruptcy orders and terms indicates he may not comply with rules and \nregulations for safeguarding classified information. Considering all evidence in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors, specifically the lack of credible evidence explaining \nwhy Applicant missed the Chapter 13 plan payments, he has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by the guideline for financial considerations.   \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  9 \n \n          Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on (SCA) March 7, 2016. On \nMarch 5, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines\n(December 10, 2016).\nApplicant answered the SOR on August 22, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on August 30, 2018. On September 4, 2018, a complete copy of the file of relevant \n02/01/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. The \nFORM included summaries of personal subject interviews (PSI) conducted on February \n10 and 24, 2017, and November 1, 2017. The PSI summaries were not authenticated as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was \nentitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI summaries, make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summaries on the \nground that they were not authenticated. Applicant received the FORM on September 12, \n2018, and did not respond. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summaries \nby failing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act \nlike lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights \nunder the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016).The case \nwas assigned to me on January 17, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 \n1.h, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old solution developer employed by a federal contractor \nsince January 2015. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1999 and a master\u2019s degree \nin May 2004. He worked as a software developer for a private-sector employer from \nJanuary 2006 to November 2011, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from \nNovember 2011 to January 2013. He was self-employed from January 2013 to January \n2015, when he accepted his current position. He has never held a security clearance. \n \nApplicant has never married and has no children. He provided no information about \nhis income and expenses while self-employed or since his current employment in January \n2015.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling about $443,600. It includes seven \ndefault judgments totaling about $330,206, of which six are unsatisfied. The court records \nreflect that the default judgments were entered after notices were sent to the addresses \nfor Applicant\u2019s rental properties, posted on the rental properties, sent to his mother\u2019s \nhome, where he lived from 2006-2009, sent to his residence from 2009-2015, sent to \nApplicant\u2019s post office box, and served by publication. (FORM Items 7-13.)  \n \nMany of the debts are related to Applicant\u2019s investments in rental properties. The \ndebts are reflected in court records (FORM Items 7-13) and credit reports from October \n2015 (FORM Item 5) and December 2017 (FORM Item 6.) The evidence concerning the \ndebts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 3) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: judgment for $10,115, filed in November 2010. This is a default \njudgment for a delinquent credit-card account. (FORM Item 7.) During the February 2017 \nPSI, Applicant told an investigator that he was unable to pay this debt because he was \nunemployed at the time and had other financial obligations. (FORM Item 4 at 9.) The debt \nis not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: judgment for $44,999, filed in November 2011. This is a default \njudgment for a delinquent mortgage loan on a rental property. The October 2016 credit \nreport reflects that the property was sold after foreclosure and the debt has a zero \nbalance. (FORM Item 5 at 6.) This judgment is satisfied. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g: judgments for $60,981, filed in February 2012; $42,547, filed \nin August 2013; $35,081, filed in August 2013; $42,200, filed in January 2015; and \n$94,283, filed in June 2015. These are default judgments for delinquent mortgage loans \non rental properties. Applicant attributed these delinquencies to his unemployment from \nNovember 2011 to January 2013 and inability to find renters for his properties. (FORM \nItem 4 at 10-11.) In Applicant\u2019s SCA, he stated that the lender foreclosed on the property \nin SOR \u00b6 1.f (judgment for $42,200), but he submitted no evidence to support his \nstatement. (GX 3 at 45.) These judgments are not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: collection account for $23,836. The credit report from May 2016 \nreflects that this debt is a delinquent student loan being collected by garnishment. (FORM \nItem 5 at 3-4.) In the February 2017 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he fell behind \non his payments because he was laid off. (FORM Item 4 at 10-11.) The debt is not \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: line of credit charged off for $9,479. In the February 2017 PSI, \nApplicant told an investigator that he did not intend to pay this debt because it was \ncharged off. (FORM Item 4 at 10.) This debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: collection account for $1,129. This debt is not reflected on the credit \nreports in the record. This allegation is not supported by the evidence. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.u: utility bills placed for collection of $364, \n$292, $88, and $73 (two bills). These debts were incurred when Applicant\u2019s tenants \nfailed to transfer the accounts to their names or failed to pay the bills. (FORM Item 3 at \n44; Form Item 4 at 12-14.) They are not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: collection account for $35,706. This debt is a delinquent credit-card \naccount. It is not resolved. (FORM Item 4 at 10.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: collection account for $32,575. This debt is a delinquent student \nloan being collected by garnishment. (FORM Item 5 at 3.) It is not resolved. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: credit-card account charged off for $8,605. In the February 2017 \nPSI, Applicant told an investigator that he did not intend to pay this debt because it was \ncharged off. (FORM Item 4 at 12.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: debt to credit union charged off for $285. This debt is an overdraft \ncharge. (FORM Item 4 at 13.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: credit-card account placed for collection of $916. In the February \n2017 PSI, Applicant acknowledged this debt. (FORM Item 4 at 12.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.t: telecommunications account placed for collection of $49. This debt \nis reflected in the October 2016 credit report. (FORM Item 5 at 12.) In the February 2017 \nPSI, Applicant was unable to identify this debt. (FORM Item 4 at 15.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he asserted that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h and 1.i were duplicates. It is unclear whether the same lending institution is involved \nin both debts. However, the evidence shows that the debts are not duplicates. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a student loan, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is a line of credit.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n\n \n6 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy \ndebts; AG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nrecent. The debts related to Applicant\u2019s rental properties (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g, 1.1, 1.r, 1.s, \nand 1.u) were incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely, because it is \nunlikely that Applicant will again venture as deeply into multiple rental-property \ninvestments as he has done in the past. The other debts alleged in the SOR were not \nincurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment, his inability to keep \nhis properties rented, and the failures of his tenants to pay their utility bills were conditions \nlargely beyond his control. However, he has not acted responsibly. He has been gainfully \nemployed for four years. He was aware of many delinquent debts when he submitted his \nSCA in March 2016, and he was questioned about his delinquent debts during the \n\n \n7 \n \nFebruary 2017 PSI. However, he submitted no evidence of efforts to renegotiate, \ncompromise, settle, or otherwise resolve any of his debts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his financial problems are not under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. The judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was resolved \nby foreclosure and the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m were or are being \nresolved by garnishment. However, these involuntary measures do not constitute good-\nfaith efforts within the meaning of this mitigating condition. Payments by involuntary \ngarnishment are \u201cnot the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the \ndebtor.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-5700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011), citing ISCR Case No. 08-\n06058 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Applicant has submitted no evidence of payments or \npayment agreements regarding the other delinquencies alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant asserted that the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are duplicates, he submitted no evidence that he has disputed any \nof the debts with the original creditors, collection agencies, or credit bureaus. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n08/14/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems. It is too soon to tell if Applicant will follow through and resolve his \nindebtedness. In addition, the evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his January 2017 \nmarijuana use while holding a security clearance. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non July 17, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on March 17, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline H for drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2018. He admitted all the allegations. He \nalso provided a three-page memorandum with explanations for the debts and proposed \ncorrective actions as well as an explanation for his marijuana use. He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 5, 2018, and \nthen reassigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place on December 6, \n2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered documentary \nexhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-7. Applicant did not offer any documentary \nexhibits. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on December 13, 2018. \n \nThe record was kept open for approximately 30 days, until January 4, 2019, to \nprovide Applicant an opportunity to submit documentation in support of his case. (Tr. 24, \n56-57) Applicant made timely submissions, by e-mail, and those matters are admitted \nwithout objections as Exhibits A-H.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance, albeit it at the higher top-secret level having previously been granted a \nclearance at the secret level. He is a logistics engineer for a large company in the \ndefense industry. He has been so employed since 2008. He began working for his \ncurrent employer initially as a contractor in 2005, and he has worked in the defense \nindustry since 2003. He earned about $81,000 in 2018. (Exhibit H) His formal education \nincludes a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology awarded in 2008.  \n \nApplicant attributed his history of financial problems to divorce and the resulting \nfinancial hardship or distress. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 28-32) He married in May 2004 and \ndivorced in December 2016. Per the divorce decree, he is obligated to pay $1,600 \nmonthly in child support for three minor children. (Exhibit G) He described separating \nfrom his family and his divorce as a \u201clife-changing event\u201d with many difficult issues to \naddress. (Tr. 26-27)  \n \nApplicant admits a history of financial problems, which is also established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7) In particular, the SOR concerns \nfive delinquent accounts as follows: (1) a student loan account in collection for $27,189; \n(2) a consumer account charged off for $2,459; (3) a credit card account (stemming \nfrom a medical account) in collection for $2,256; (4) a credit card account (stemming \nfrom automobile expenses) in collection for $387; and (5) a student loan account with a \npast-due balance of $2,415 with a total balance of $44,652. Applicant has made some \nprogress in resolving the delinquent accounts, and he presented supporting \ndocumentation to establish that progress. (Exhibits A-E)  \n\n \n3 \n \nBeginning with the two student loan accounts, Applicant used the proceeds of the \nloans to obtain his bachelor\u2019s degree. He was unable to maintain the loan payments \ndue to his divorce and resulting financial hardship as well as the lack of any assistance \ngranted by the lender or creditor. Both loans are no longer with the original lender, the \nU.S. Department of Education, and were consolidated by another creditor. (Exhibit B; \nTr. 33-35) The total due for the consolidated account was $59,183 as of December 3, \n2018. He entered into a loan rehabilitation program in October 2018, agreeing to a \nmonthly repayment amount of $5 for nine months. Applicant thought $5 per month was \n\u201cridiculous\u201d and set the monthly payment at $125. (Tr. 40)  \n \nTurning to the three delinquent consumer accounts, the $2,459 charged-off \naccount was \u201csettled in full\u201d after the hearing. (Exhibit C; Tr. 34) The $2,256 collection \naccount is no longer with the original creditor, and the new creditor turned the account \nover to a law firm who initiated wage garnishment without success due to Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly child-support payment. (Exhibit D; Tr. 34-35) He had not made a payment on \nthe debt at the time of the hearing. Post-hearing in January 2018, the law firm agreed to \naccept $100 per month until the entire balance of $2,564, with accrued interest, is paid \nin full, with the first payment due on January 10, 2019. The $387 charged-off account \nwas resolved for a payment of about $192 in December 2018 or January 2019. (Exhibit \nE; Tr.34).  \n \nConcerning the illegal drug use, Applicant admitted smoking marijuana in about \nJanuary 2017, when he was on vacation visiting family in a state that has decriminalized \nmarijuana use. (Tr. 26-28) His marijuana use occurred about a month after his divorce \nwas finalized in December 2016. He described his marijuana use \u201cwas more like a \ntouristy thing to do\u201d while drinking beer and hanging out. (Tr. 27) He conceded there \nwas no justification for his conduct. (Tr. 27) He admitted that his marijuana use was \ncontrary to his employer\u2019s zero-tolerance policy. (Tr. 50-51) He admitted that he \npurchased the marijuana, which was a single container with two cigarettes. (Tr. 52) He \ndid not self-report his marijuana use when he returned to work after his vacation. (Tr. \n52-54; Exhibit 3) But he disclosed his marijuana use when he completed his July 2017 \nsecurity clearance application, describing it as recreational use of marijuana, and he \nstated that he had no intention to use in the future. (Exhibit 1) He has not used any \nmarijuana since the January 2017 incident. (Tr. 28) Post-hearing, he submitted a signed \nstatement wherein he pledged to abstain from all future [illegal drug] involvement and \nsubstance misuse. (Exhibit F) He also stated that recreational use of marijuana is not \nworth losing his career, and it was his responsibility to refrain from such activity.   \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n4 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, the genesis of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nis his divorce, finalized in December 2016, and the resulting financial hardship or \ndistress it created for him. Those were circumstances largely beyond his control. He \nacted reasonably under the circumstances by honoring his obligation to pay child \nsupport for the benefit of his three minor children. But as shown by his recent remedial \nactions, he probably could have done more sooner to address his delinquent debts. \nGiven these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part, and \nApplicant receives some credit in mitigation.  \n \n \nIt is too soon to tell if Applicant is adhering to \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to resolve the \nfive delinquent accounts. With that said, he certainly receives credit for getting his two \nstudent loan accounts into a rehabilitation agreement. And he receives credit for settling \ntwo of the consumer accounts and entering into a payment agreement on the third. \nNevertheless, both the timing of the remedial actions and the length of the remedial \nactions are questions of fact that are relevant in deciding if an applicant has made a \ngood-faith effort. Here, Applicant entered into the rehabilitation agreement for the \nstudent loans about two months before the hearing and made the initial monthly \npayments. For the three consumer accounts, one was settled in full after the hearing, \nanother was resolved around the time of the hearing, and the third was entered into a \nrepayment arrangement after the hearing. Given these circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the overall \nconcern is set forth in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \n\n \n6 \n \n[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescriptions and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. . . . \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance abuse; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana, which is \nlimited to the January 2017 incident, when he used marijuana recreationally while on a \n\n \n7 \n \nvacation in a state that has decriminalized marijuana use. His marijuana use was about \none month after his divorce was finalized. His marijuana use occurred while holding a \nsecurity clearance, giving him access to classified information for his job in the defense \nindustry. And his marijuana use was in violation of his employer\u2019s zero-tolerance policy. \nAny illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a person\u2019s security \nworthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs while granted access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana in January 2017 cannot be \nmitigated as a youthful indiscretion. As a working engineer for a company in the defense \nindustry, his conduct was particularly egregious. More is expected given his age, \nmaturity, experience, and lengthy work history as a cleared employee in the defense \nindustry.     \n \n \nApplicant presented a decent case in reform and rehabilitation. It is apparent that \nhe now understands the seriousness of his marijuana use while holding a security \nclearance. And I have no concern or worry that he has a substance-abuse issue with \nmarijuana. Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that he is an acceptable security risk. I \nreached that conclusion for a couple of reasons. First, his marijuana use was a serious \nlapse in good judgment. Second, it\u2019s unlikely that Applicant\u2019s January 2017 marijuana \nuse would have come to light in the near future but for the requirement to complete the \nJuly 2017 security clearance application. Indeed, he did not self-report his marijuana \nuse to his employer when he returned from vacation. His reluctance to self-report further \nundermines his suitability for a security clearance.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. Although Applicant \npresented some favorable evidence in mitigation, it was outweighed by the unfavorable \nevidence. In particular, his marijuana use while holding a security clearance is serious \nmisconduct that militates against a favorable decision. I conclude that he has not met \nhis ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a -- 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations raised under both guidelines. He is 42 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he had never been married and he has three children. (Tr.20) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems in 2015, and a graduate degree in business administration in 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2004 until 2015. Since 2015, he has served in the Reserve. Applicant has worked with his current employer since 2018. He has held a DOD security clearance for many years. (GE 1) In about November 2002, Applicant was charged with assault on a female.

Schacter, Esq. \n \n07/05/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under criminal conduct and personal \nconduct. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 30, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under J (criminal conduct), and \nE (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 21, 2018, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on February 14, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 1, 2019, scheduling the hearing for \nApril 10, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter, its exhibit list, and Applicant\u2019s exhibit \nlist as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through K, which were admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 17, 2019.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations raised under \nboth guidelines. He is 42 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he had never been \nmarried and he has three children. (Tr.20)  \n \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems in 2015, \nand a graduate degree in business administration in 2017. He served on active duty in \nthe U.S. Army from 2004 until 2015. Since 2015, he has served in the Reserve. \nApplicant has worked with his current employer since 2018. He has held a DOD security \nclearance for many years. (GE 1) \n \n \nIn about November 2002, Applicant was charged with assault on a female. He \nand his girlfriend at the time were in a car and had a heated argument. As he was \nexiting the car, his girlfriend hit him in the back of his head, and he turned back and \nstruck her in the face. (Tr.33, GE 3) She called the police and Applicant was charged.  \nHowever, the girlfriend admitted that she struck Applicant first and the case was \ndismissed. At that time, a restraining order was put in place. The couple reunited and \nwere driving when stopped by the police a year late in 2003. Applicant was arrested for \nviolating a restraining order. He and his girlfriend had been back in their relationship for \nsome time and the issue of the restraining order did not occur to them. They were both \nat fault, but Applicant was sent to jail for 48 hours. (Tr. 35) Applicant\u2019s girlfriend became \nthe mother of his child. They now have an amicable relationship, although they are not \ntogether. Applicant reports that she is a great mother. (Tr. 36) His former girlfriend wrote \na letter of recommendation for him. (AE F-2)  She recounted the details of the domestic \nincident in 2002, but stated that Applicant has been a great father to their son and is a \ntrustworthy person. She recommends him for the security clearance. (SOR 1.a-1.b) \n \n \nAfter these incidents, Applicant entered the military, earned a security clearance \nand served abroad. He obtained many medals and achievement awards. His record \nreflects his excellent career in the military. (AE 1-12) On his initial security clearance \napplication, he disclosed the above two domestic incidents. \n \n \nIn July 2014, Applicant was dating another woman. They were driving home from \na vacation with his son and her child in a rental car. He had been driving while his \ngirlfriend was sleeping. At some point, they engaged in a heated argument. (GE 2) \nApplicant returned the rental car and he and his girlfriend proceeded to drive to her \nhome in her car. His car was parked in her garage. When they arrived, she prevented \nhim from entering the garage to get his car and keys. Applicant went in to her garage to \nget his car and keys. (Tr. 63 ) According to the security report (GE 5) she repeatedly \ngrabbed him and once he was in the home and obtained his keys to leave, she blocked \n\n \n3 \n \nthe door and repeatedly grabbed him around the legs. (Tr. 38) Applicant pushed her off \nand she fell. The girlfriend called the police and Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith 2nd degree assault, reckless endangerment and burglary. (GE 7) When Applicant \nwent to court, the burglary charge was dismissed and the domestic violence charge was \nchanged to reckless endangerment. (GE 6) Applicant was given eighteen months of \nprobation that ended in 2016. (GE 2) This charge has been expunged from his record. \nHe was ordered to attend anger management classes from September 2014 to March \n2016. This incident was reported to his commander. (GE 2) He ended the relationship \nwith this woman after this incident. (Tr. 39) \n \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant had an encounter with a woman who was renting a \nroom from him. She started renting in 2015. He stated that they were not in a \nrelationship but had sex. (Tr. 40) He was charged with assault on a family member \nbecause she called the police and reported that Applicant had straddled her, grabbed \nher, and shook her. (GE 9) Applicant was dating another woman and the woman who \nwas renting a room from him was jealous. On February 22, 2016, the woman withdrew \nher statements about the incident and the case was dismissed. (GE 9) \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s fianc\u00e9e testified at the hearing. She has known him for about two \nyears. They do not live with each other. She has met his family and Applicant has met \nher daughter. They plan to marry. She has never seen any violent behavior in their \nrelationship. (Tr. 100) She is aware of the SOR allegations and they have discussed the \nvarious incidents. \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted about 16 character references and affidavits from military \npersonnel, colleagues and friends who have known him a long time. Each letter attests \nto his honesty, reliability and overall integrity. (AE F 1-10) \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly at the hearing that he was quite young when the \nincidents occurred in 2002 and 2003. The woman from those incidents is the mother of \nhis child and believes him to be a good family man. She wrote a letter of reference for \nhim. They maintain a good relationship for the sake of their child.  \n \n \nThere were no incidents of any kind for almost 11 years. Applicant dated many \npeople and was not always using good judgment in the relationship at times. He has \ntaken more anger management classes and has learned to walk away from certain \nsituations. He explained that he knows how to avoid conflict. He is in a stable \nrelationship with a mature woman who he hopes to marry.   \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nTo affect a national security eligibility decision, but when in combination cast \nDoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was charged in 2002 involving an incident with his girlfriend and in \n2003 with violation of a protective order. He was charged in 2014 with assault, reckless \nendangerment and burglary. In 2016, he was charged with assault on a family member. \nAG \u00b6 31(a,b) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred in 2002, 2003, 2014, and 2016. The \nincidents all involved women he was dating at the time. The early charges were \ndismissed and the woman has written a reference for him. As to the 2014 and 2016 \nunique incidents, the charges were either dismissed completely or a lesser offense was \nadmitted. Applicant completed probation and anger management classes on two \nseparate occasions and has learned from mistakes he made in certain relationships. He \nis in a stable mature relationship. He is cognizant of some of his poor choices in \nrelationships. I find that the incidents happened under unusual circumstances, they are \nunlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. He had a military career and good employment. He is a family man. He \nis mature and aware that he must deal with any conflict in an appropriate manner. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n\n \n6 \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nPersonal conduct allegations are cross-alleged in 2.a-2-2.d. As discussed above, \nApplicant has mitigated the SOR allegations under criminal conduct and thus since the \nsame incidents are referenced under personal conduct, he has mitigated those as well. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 (2a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, J, and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant credibly testified at the hearing. He has taken responsibility by taking \nanger management classes on two occasions.  He served in the military and has many \ncertificates of achievement and awards. He submitted many character references, \nincluding one from the mother of his first child who was involved in the incident in 2002 \n\n \n7 \n \nand 2003. He was candid, sincere, and remorseful. He disputed the last incident in \n2016, and the charge was dismissed. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under criminal conduct and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment with a federal contractor for gross negligence in September 2016, after his employer\u2019s internal investigation determined that he intentionally and knowingly manipulated program performance test data. Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his employment for gross negligence, but denied any misconduct or that he intentionally or knowingly manipulated the data. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 62-year-old design engineer working for a federal contractor. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 1985, and received a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) in 2017, both from U.S. universities.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n07/24/2019 \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was terminated from his employment for gross negligence after he \nmanipulated program performance test data. His evidence is insufficient to establish \nthat his family is aware of his misconduct and his termination. He deliberately failed to \ninform his current employer of his 2016 termination. He is still vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. He failed to demonstrate his reliability, trustworthiness, ability \nto comply with the law, rules and regulations, and his ability to protect classified \ninformation. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. Clearance denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 9, 2017. \nAfter reviewing the SCA and the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \non April 10, 2018, explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. Security \nconcerns were raised under Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant denied the sole \nSOR allegation, submitted 13 pages in mitigation and extenuation, and requested a \ndecision based on the record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), submitting the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nFebruary 4, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on February 13, 2019. He was allowed \n30 days to submit any objections to the FORM and to provide material to refute, \nextenuate, and mitigate the concerns. Applicant responded to the FORM with a six page \ndocument that I made part of the record. He raised no objections. The case was \nassigned to me on April 12, 2019. I admitted and considered the Government\u2019s \nproposed evidence and Applicant\u2019s submissions.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment with a \nfederal contractor for gross negligence in September 2016, after his employer\u2019s internal \ninvestigation determined that he intentionally and knowingly manipulated program \nperformance test data. Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his employment \nfor gross negligence, but denied any misconduct or that he intentionally or knowingly \nmanipulated the data. \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of \nfact:  \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old design engineer working for a federal contractor. He \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 1985, and \nreceived a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) in 2017, both from U.S. universities. He married in \n1982, and has two adult children.  \n \nBetween 2000 and 2010, Applicant worked for federal contractor \u201c1.\u201d He worked \nfor federal contractor \u201c2\u201d from 2010 until he was terminated in September 2016 for gross \nnegligence and intentionally and knowingly manipulating program performance test \ndata. An adverse incident report was submitted by contractor \u201c2\u201d to the Defense \nIndustrial Security Clearance Office shortly after Applicant\u2019s termination in September \n2016. He has held a clearance since about 2007. \n \nApplicant was unemployed between September 2016 and January 2017. He was \nhired and has been working for his current employer and security sponsor, federal \ncontractor \u201c3,\u201d since January 2017.  \n \nIn his response to Section 13A (Employment Activities) of his March 2017 SCA, \nApplicant disclosed that he was terminated by contractor \u201c2\u201d after some data anomaly \nwas discovered accidentally in September 2016 and he was blamed for it. He stated he \ndid not remember exactly what happened three years ago, but that he was terminated \nfor gross negligence.  \n \nApplicant admitted to committing gross negligence in an email to a supervisor \nand others, dated May 5, 2016. (Applicant\u2019s Memo 1-1) In that same email, he explains \nhow data could have been deleted and the wrong data overwritten. He stated:  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nI usually create working directory, and copy the results to the main \ndirectory, but in this case, it looks like the working directory I processed . . \n. . has been deleted . . . . so it is possible that this working directory got \ndeleted inadvertently . . . . before data had been captured . . . . I think it is \na strong possibility that I must have entered the wrong numbers to \nproduce wrong results . . . . But, I tried to reproduce the results I got from \nthe scratch since I could not find the control files . . . . I think it is a strong \npossibility that I must have entered the wrong numbers to produce wrong \nresults . . . . I feel immense shame that this represents a gross negligence \non record keeping on my part. \n \nApplicant also admitted to his program manager that he intentionally substituted \ndata from another test into his test data. To substitute the data, Applicant had to \nmanually overwrite the test data results. A folder with data was erased from contractor\u2019s \n\u201c2\u201d network. The overwriting and erasing of the data was established through the \ncomputer logs. When questioned by a second coworker about the data substitution, \nApplicant stated that he wanted to \u201ccome clean\u201d and asked the coworker to pray for him. \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he had no recollection of \nknowingly and intentionally manipulating the test data. He also did not remember using \nthe words \u201ccome clean,\u201d but stated that if he used them, it must have been in reference \nto different data or in a different context. \n \nConcerning his admission of gross negligence in his email to his supervisor \n(Memo 1-1), Applicant believes that his statement was misunderstood by contractor \u201c2\u201d \nas an admission of wrongdoing and gross negligence. He stated that the gross \nnegligence he expressed was a reference to his own standard of not keeping the \npersonal record, but avers that the personal record keeping was not a contractual \nrequirement.  \n \nApplicant also noted that there were at least three engineers with access to the \nsame computer and data, and any of the three could have done what he was accused \nof doing. He believes that he was singled out by contractor \u201c2\u201d as a scapegoat for the \ncontractor\u2019s negligence in up keeping and maintaining its test equipment. \n  \nThe Department of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations submitted a \nreport of investigation (ROI) in September 2017. The report titled Applicant for fraud \noffenses (false pretenses/swindle/confidence game).  \n \nDuring his September 2017 background interview with a government \ninvestigator, Applicant stated that he had not disclosed his termination to any member \nof his family or friends. He lied to his spouse about his termination and told her that he \nhad retired early. When asked why, he stated that his native country\u2019s culture does not \nallow for the head of a household to be disgraced in the eyes of his family. He reiterated \nthat if this become an issue he would retire. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose his termination to his current employer, contractor \u201c3.\u201d \nApplicant told the investigator that this was a big trauma in his life. He is very \nembarrassed and has a difficult time talking about his termination. Applicant stated that \nthe incident cannot be used to blackmail him. He further stated that if his current \nemployer (contractor \u201c3\u201d) discovered the termination and fired him, he would retire. \n \nIn his answer to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant adopted the summary of his \nthree 2017 interviews. In his response, he indicated that when he was terminated, he \nhired an attorney to contest his termination and requested an administrative officer \nreview to be performed by contactor \u201c2.\u201d He did not follow up on the appeal of his \ntermination because the legal fees were too expensive and he had moved out of state \nto take the job with contractor \u201c3\u201d.\u201d He also stated that after his interviews in 2017, he \nhad a chat with his wife about his termination and she was now aware of it.  \n \nApplicant noted in his answer to the FORM that he had not disclosed his \ntermination for gross negligence to his current employer, contractor \u201c3.\u201d He explained it \nwas very difficult to for him to voluntarily disclose his termination after contractor \u201c3\u201d \nidentified him as a valuable asset and had spent more than $50,000 for his relocation. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.    \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant intentionally and knowingly manipulated program performance test \ndata, resulting in his termination from his employment with a federal contractor for gross \nnegligence in September 2016. Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his \nemployment for gross negligence, but denied any misconduct or that he intentionally or \nknowingly manipulated the data.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s emails and memoranda establish that he, apparently inadvertently, \ndeleted his working directory before the data had been captured and that he then \nknowingly entered the wrong numbers to produce the anomalies later discovered by \nemployer \u201c2.\u201d In his then correspondence, Applicant expressed immense shame \nhighlighting that this actions represented a gross negligence on record keeping on his \npart. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . . .  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists two conditions that are partially raised by the facts in this case and \ncould potentially mitigate the personal conduct security concerns:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was serious and not a minor offense, particularly \nconsidering that he was hired for his expertise and scientific abilities to monitor, \nconduct, and record test data from experiments. Applicant manipulated the data and \nfailed to disclose his misconduct and gross negligence for several years until the \nmistakes were discovered because the data recorded could not be reproduced. His \nactions are disturbing for a person of his education and work experience. They show \nthat he cannot be trusted to apply his knowledge and expertise, to do his job, or to \ndisclose problems to his employer when they occur. Under the circumstances, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior currently cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n \nApplicant has not admitted his misconduct and continues to perpetuate his false \nstatements to present. Furthermore, he has taken no positive steps to reduce or \neliminate his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. He deliberately and \nknowingly failed to inform his new employer (contractor \u201c3\u201d) that he was terminated from \nhis prior employment for gross negligence and misconduct. Moreover, although he \nclaimed that he had \u201ca chat with his wife,\u201d his statement alone, in light of his other \nmisrepresentations, is insufficient to establish that she and his family know about his \nmisconduct. Thus, he is still susceptible to blackmail, influence, or duress. \n \nNone of personal conduct mitigating conditions are supported by the facts and \nthey do not mitigate the SOR allegation, which continues to raise concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), (d), and (e). Guideline E security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old design engineer working for a federal contractor. He \nattended a U.S. university and achieved a Ph.D. He has worked for federal contractors \nsince at least 2000, and held a clearance since about 2007. He was terminated from his \nemployment for gross negligence after he intentionally and knowingly manipulated \nprogram performance test data. Applicant disclosed his termination in his 2017 SCA.  \n \nNotwithstanding, his evidence is insufficient to establish that his family is aware of \nhis misconduct and his termination. He has deliberately failed to inform his current \nemployer of his 2016 termination. He is still vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. Applicant\u2019s lack of judgment and his unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations continue to raise questions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. The personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information granted. \nStatement of Case \nOn March 27, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Applicant answered the SOR on April 24, 2018, and requested her case \nbe decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing (Item 1). \nOn July 2, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was mailed \nto Applicant and received by her on July 13, 2018. The FORM notified Applicant that she \nhad an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant timely submitted a response \nto the FORM in August 2018, which contained numerous documents. I marked that \n04/12/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nsubmission as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. Items 1 through 6 and AE A are admitted into \nevidence without objection.

On March 27, 2019, Applicant timely submitted a cover letter with 24 pages. I \nmarked that cover letter with attachments as AE B. Department Counsel had no objection \nto that exhibit. \n  \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted all delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, except those in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, \n1.j, and 1.l, which she said were paid. She admitted that she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nin 2010. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and never married.

(Item 2)  \n \n \nOn September 13, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). In it, she disclosed a garnishment, a bankruptcy, and delinquent accounts, \nincluding several medical debts. She stated that she could not afford to pay many of them \nbecause she was supporting other people and unemployed at times. She disclosed that \nshe filed bankruptcy in January 2010 and subsequently discharged about $11,000 in \ndelinquent debts. (Item 2) \n \n \nOn September 6, 2017, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about her \nbackground and information in her SCA, including financial matters. (Item 3) During the \ninterview, she said that she filed bankruptcy because she was a single parent and could \nnot pay all of her daughter\u2019s medical bills and their living expenses. She used credit cards \nto pay bills at times. It is unknown if she received child support. (Item 3)   \n \n \nIn her April 23, 2018 answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that she had \nbeen financially irresponsible in the past. However, she stated that she has since learned \nto live within her means and has used a well-known financial management system to help \nresolve debts. She submitted several documents with her answer indicating that she had \nbeen making payments on some medical debts that were not alleged in the SOR. She \nalso noted that in July 2017 she paid off two open credit cards. (Item 1)  \n \n \nIn her August 7, 2018 response to the FORM, Applicant said that she paid off an \ninstallment loan on a vehicle she had purchased, and provided proof of the payment. (AE \nA) She also submitted a document indicating that, as of July 2018, she had paid about \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n$4,600 owed to a creditor for medical bills related to her daughter\u2019s illness. The initial debt \nwas about $9,000; the current balance is $5,139. She submitted a payment plan to \nresolve her outstanding debts, including the two largest debts alleged in the SOR: $6,873 \nand $2,562. She intended to begin the plan in November 2018, and have the debts paid \nby August 2019. (AE A) In her March 27, 2019 submission, Applicant stated that she was \nunable to follow through on that payment plan because she incurred about $2,400 of \nunexpected automobile repairs in November 2018. She said she subsequently paid the \ncar bills. (AE B)   \n \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in budget or credit counseling, but anticipates \nenrolling in a formal course in the future. (AE B) She submitted a budget. Her net monthly \nincome is $3,010. Her expenses are about $3,000, and include payments of about $400 \non delinquent debts and a $100 payment to the IRS.1 (AE B at 19)   \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from October \n2016, January 2018, and June 2018, the SOR alleged a 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and \n16 debts that became delinquent between 2012 and 2016, and totaled $15,822. Eleven \nallegations were unpaid medical debts and totaled $5,199.

(AE B at 17) It \nis resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q alleged that in January 2010, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In \nMay 2010, the bankruptcy was discharged. She estimated that the court discharged about \n$11,000 of delinquent debts. Applicant said she filed the bankruptcy because she was a \nsingle mother raising her daughter and could not afford to pay medical bills and other \nexpenses at that time. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from family members. They praise \nher hardworking and honest nature. (AE A) Applicant\u2019s project manager is aware of the \nfinancial problems alleged as part of the security clearance process, but does not believe \nthey interfere with Applicant\u2019s work or trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who is also \nthe human resource manager, stated that Applicant is an exemplary employee. (AE A) \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 There is no identified creditor on this CBR or telephone number listed for this debt.  \n \n3 There is no identified creditor on this CBR or telephone number listed for this debt. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the pertinent AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations of the security concern, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nBased on her admissions and CBRs, Applicant has a history of being unable to \nmeet financial obligations, which began prior to her filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010 \nand continues into the present. The evidence raises security concerns under the above \ndisqualifying conditions, and shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate \nthose concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Four are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has had ongoing financial problems since 2010, when she filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. Although she has resolved or is resolving 11 of the 16 delinquent \ndebts, five remain unresolved. The evidence establishes limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(a). Applicant attributed the delinquent debts and bankruptcy to having insufficient \nmoney to support herself and daughter, and to pay medical expenses. It is unknown \nwhether she received child support. She also admitted that she had irresponsibly \nmanaged her money at some point. To the extent that the financial problems arose from \ncircumstances beyond her control and she attempted to manage them through payment \nplans and a budget, AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. There is insufficient evidence that she \nparticipated in formal credit or financial counseling and that all delinquent debts are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. She provided evidence that she made good-faith \nefforts to repay or resolve 11 of the 16 delinquent SOR-alleged debts, including two debts \nthat were paid after she received the order re-opening the record. She established some \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) as to those debts. She provided evidence that in July 2018, \nshe paid off her current automobile loan. She has significantly reduced the balance on a \nlarge debt owed to a creditor, further demonstrating good-faith efforts to address debts \nand establishing the application of AG \u00b6 20(d).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nApplicant is a mature individual who began working for a defense contractor in \nAugust 2016. In her September 2016 SCA, she honestly disclosed derogatory information \nrelated to her finances and delinquent debts, including a 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nSince working in her current position, she has been steadily resolving debts, including \none that was not alleged on the SOR. She resolved, or is resolving, 11 of the 16 alleged \ndebts that total $4,889. She stated she intends to address the two largest SOR debts, \n$6,873, and $2,562, after she finishes paying smaller debts. She has a budget that \nincludes payments on delinquent debts. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element \nin the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrates that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic.4 \n \n \nApplicant established a track record of managing debts and finances, and is \ndemonstrating reliability. Her employer is aware of the financial problems and continues \nto support her request for a security clearance. Applicant is cognizant that further financial \ndelinquencies or problems may jeopardize her position with the defense contractor. She \nhas satisfactorily exhibited a commitment to resolving the delinquent debts. Based on her \nactions to date, I do not have questions or concerns about her reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. I find she mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n       FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q:  \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3) App. Bd.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 22, 2016. On March \n9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent \nhim a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 5, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 24, 2018, and \n12/26/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nthe case was assigned to an administrative judge on August 9, 2018. On September 11, \n2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for October 17, 2018. The case was reassigned to me on October \n16, 2018, due to illness of the assigned judge. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. I kept the record open until October \n31, 2018, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted \nAX B through D. AX B was an encrypted document that could not be opened. It pertained \nto a debt not alleged in the SOR. I contacted Applicant on December 6, 2018, and \nrequested that he send an unencrypted version of the document, but he did not respond. \n(Hearing Exhibit I.) I did not admit AX B. AX C and D were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 24, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old tactical communicator employed by defense contractors \nsince June 2012. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1998 to June \n2012, attained the rank of staff sergeant, and received an honorable discharge because \nof his inability to maintain weight standards due to a medical condition. He is taking online \ncollege courses and expects to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree by the end of 2018. (Tr. 31-\n32.) He has held a security clearance since 1998 and received eligibility for access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) in November 2008. (Tr. 34.)  \n \n \nApplicant enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1997 and was assigned to a \nSpecial Forces unit. He was assigned to an installation in the United States from 1998 to \n2001. During this time he was single and followed the \u201cSam Walton\u201d practice: \u201cIf you can\u2019t \nafford it, you don\u2019t buy it.\u201d From 2001 until 2012, he was deployed most of the time. He \nmarried in 2004, and has two children from the marriage, ages 14 and 11. He trusted his \nwife to manage the family finances while he was deployed. (Tr. 27.) His wife incurred \nseveral of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR and used a power of attorney to open \naccounts in his name without his knowledge. (Tr. 53.) Except for the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, he did not specifically identify which accounts were opened without his knowledge \nor consent. He has not disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling about $27,000, which are reflected \nin credit reports from August 2016 (GX 2) and February 2018 (GX 3). In October 2017, \nApplicant and his wife joined a personal finance counseling group that met weekly. They \ncompleted the program December 2017. The leader of the counseling group considers \nApplicant and his wife as \u201cone of the success stories\u201d for the counseling group. (Answer \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nto SOR; AX A.) The counseling program assigns a sponsor to each participant. Applicant \ntestified that he meets with his sponsor about every two weeks to review his progress. \n(Tr. 71.) He testified that he received financial counseling while he was on active duty, \nbut he enrolled in the most recent course so that his wife would attend it. His wife now \nunderstands that \u201cdebt doesn\u2019t have to be a lifestyle.\u201d (Tr. 44.) Their plan is to set aside \n$1,000 per month and use it to pay off delinquent debts. (Tr. 69.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay is about $5,556 per month, and he receives disability \npay of $1,809 per month. His wife has been employed since September 2017, and her \ntake-home pay is about $1,750 per month. Their monthly budget accounts for all their \nmonthly income. It provides for payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, \n1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, and a monthly contribution of $1,096.50 to an \u201cemergency fund. (Tr. \n36-38; AX C.) \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: military credit-card account placed for collection of $13,877. \nApplicant testified that he has been making monthly $150 payments for about two years, \nbut the finance fees limited his progress in reducing the debt. His budget provides for a \nmonthly $150 payment on this account, but he submitted no documentation that any \nmonthly payments have been made. He made a lump-sum payment in March 2018 that \nreduced the debt to $6,575. He testified that he is trying to negotiate a lump-sum \nsettlement but has not yet been successful. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 47-51; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: charge account charged off for $3,313. Applicant testified that he \nwas unsure about the nature of this debt. He contacted the creditor after receiving the \nSOR, but he has been unable to negotiate a payment agreement. His budget provides \nfor a monthly payment of $58.75 to this creditor, but he submitted no documentation of \nany payments. (Tr. 54-56; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: delinquent rent placed for collection of $1,554. Applicant testified \nthat this debt was incurred for rent while a home was being cleaned after they vacated it. \nThey contacted the creditor about a possible payment agreement, but the creditor insisted \non full payment. The debt is not resolved. (Tr. 57-58.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $1,173. Applicant testified that \nhis wife opened this account without his knowledge. He was not sure if he had made any \npayments on this debt. (Tr. 58-59.) His budget provides for a monthly $35 payment to this \ncreditor, but he submitted no documentation of payments. (AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit-card account placed for collection of $1,007. At the hearing, \nApplicant was not sure if he had made any payments on this account. (Tr. 60.) It is not \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: payday loan placed for collection of $500. This debt was paid in full \nin March 2018. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 60.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: charge account charged off for $421. Applicant testified that he was \nmaking payments on this debt. His budget provides for a monthly $70 payment to this \ncreditor, but he submitted no documentation of any payments. (Tr. 61; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: online charge account charged off for $263. Applicant testified that \nhe contacted the creditor in March 2018 and has offered to pay the debt in full, but that \nthe creditor cannot find his account. (Tr. 63.) The debt is not resolved. (Tr. 62.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: online charge account placed for collection of $855. Applicant \ntestified that he offered to make monthly payments in March 2018, but the collection \nagency was unable to find his account. (Tr. 64.) His budget provides for a monthly $142 \npayment to this creditor, but he submitted no documentation of any payments. (AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: charge account placed for collection of $507. Applicant testified that \nhe had a payment agreement for this debt, but he was not sure whether any payments \nhad been made. (Tr. 65-66.) His budget provides for a payment of $58.75 to this creditor, \nbut he submitted no documentation of any payments. (AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: charge account placed for collection of $165. Applicant testified \nthat the collection agency was unable to locate his account. His budget provided for \npayment in full in October 2018, but he submitted no documentation that he paid it. (Tr. \n66; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: satellite-television service placed for collection of $206. Applicant \ntestified that this debt was the final bill for service and had been paid, but he submitted \nno documentation of payment. (Tr. 66.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: bank loan placed for collection of $3,497. At the hearing, Applicant \nwas unsure about the nature of this loan. He testified that he contacted the bank in March \n2018, but the bank insisted on full payment. (Tr. 67-68.) \n \n \nA co-worker, who has known Applicant since July 2016 and has daily contact with \nhim, testified that Applicant is \u201cone of the most thrifty, cost-conscious, less excessive \npersonalities\u201d that he has encountered. He has no reason to question Applicant\u2019s \nreliability or trustworthiness. (Tr. 19-25.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n\n \n5 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).The \nfollowing mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The financial irresponsibility and misuse of a \npower of attorney by Applicant\u2019s wife were circumstances beyond his control. However, \nhe has not provided evidence of responsible conduct. He completed a credit-counseling \ncourse in December 2017, but he has not provided documentary evidence of any \nsignificant steps to resolve his delinquent debts until March 2018, after he received the \nSOR.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant completed a financial counseling \ncourse, but he has not shown \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial problems are under \ncontrol. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \nApplicant has a plan, but he has not presented evidence of significant actions to \nimplement it. He paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f after he received the SOR. He has \nnot submitted evidence that he made any payments on any debts before he received the \nSOR. He claimed that he had been making payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nfor two years, but he submitted no documentary evidence to support his claim. Applicants \nwho claim that debts have been or are being resolved are expected to present \ndocumentary evidence supporting their claim. ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nOct. 19, 2016). The mitigating effect of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent debts \nis diminished by the fact that they all occurred after he received the SOR. An applicant \nwho waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the \njudgment expected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-\n01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2017). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not submitted evidence that he \ndisputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR with the original creditors, collection \nagencies, or credit bureaus. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, the testimony of his co-worker, and his candor and sincerity at the hearing. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information and \nSCI. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

She did not make sufficient progress resolving her delinquent debts. \nFinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.      \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 27, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR \nset forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. \n \nOn September 26, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a \nhearing. (HE 3) On October 19, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On \nOctober 29, 2018, the case was assigned to me. Applicant was unavailable in December \n2018, and the case was delayed until January 2019. (HE 1A) On January 17, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s \nhearing for January 24, 2019. (HE 1B) The hearing was delayed due to snow at \nApplicant\u2019s location. (HE 1C) On January 28, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for February 8, 2019. (HE 1D) The hearing was held as scheduled \nusing video teleconference.  \n  \nDepartment Counsel offered nine exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; \nthere were no objections to the documents; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. \n13, 17; GE 1-9) On February 21, 2019, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the \nhearing. The record initially closed on April 10, 2019. (Tr. 38-39) I granted an extension \nto April 17, 2019. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) B) Applicant provided six exhibits. (AE C-AE H)   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through \n1.n. (HE 3) She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old supply quality engineer, and she has been employed by \nher current defense-contractor employer since August 2017. (Tr. 5-6; GE 1) She has \nnever served in the military. (Tr. 6) In 1987, she married, and her children are ages 24 \nand 27. (Tr. 6) Her husband has driven a truck for several years, and he has been an \nowner-operator of a truck for the previous two years. (Tr. 7) \n \nIn 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 1986, she received a \nbachelors of science degree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 7-8) She has held a security \nclearance for 28 years, and there is no evidence that she ever compromised security. (Tr. \n19)    \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant attributed most of her financial problems, including her federal income \ntax debts, to her unemployment for about 30 months and her husband\u2019s occasional \nunemployment. (Tr. 8-9, 22) She was unemployed from 2014 to 2016 and for several \nmonths in 2017 until August 2017. (Tr. 8-9) She was continuously employed from 1986 \nto 2013 by two large defense contractors. (Tr. 8-9) Applicant and her husband have \nseparate households in different states because of employment requirements, which \nresults in additional expenses. (Tr. 26) Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges the following financial \nissues: \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c allege Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. Her 2011 federal income tax return was filed \nthree months late. (Tr. 27) She provided an IRS Form 1040 for her 2012 federal income \ntax return, and it is undated. (AE C) Her federal income tax transcript shows her 2016 \nfederal income tax return was timely filed. (AE D) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g allege Applicant owes federal income taxes totaling \n$40,828, for the following amounts and tax years: $13,695 for 2009; $4,674 for 2010; \n$4,050 for 2011; and $18,409 for 2014. She made payments to the IRS under an \ninstallment program from October 2015 to April 2017. (Tr. 22-23) She stopped making \npayments in April 2017, due to unemployment. (Tr. 23-24) Her payments under the \ninstallment agreement may also have been affected by her Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. \n(Tr. 25) She currently owes the IRS about $75,000. (Tr. 25) In July or August 2018, she \ncontacted the IRS and attempted to establish another installment agreement; however, \n\u201cit fell through.\u201d (Tr. 25-26) Applicant did not know why it was not reestablished. (Tr. 26) \nHer most recent payment to the IRS under an installment agreement was in April 2017. \n(Tr. 27)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in about September \n2016, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in about February 2017. Applicant completed \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 29) The bankruptcy court wanted her to pay $1,600 monthly, \nand she considered this amount to be unaffordable. (Tr. 29) The bankruptcy was \ndismissed. (Tr. 29; GE 8)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant had a mortgage in the amount of $448,867, and her \nmortgage was foreclosed around 2016. For one year, Applicant made her mortgage \npayments using funds from her 401(k) account. (Tr. 30) During her unemployment, she \nwas unable to make payments on her mortgage, and she had \u201cto walk away.\u201d (Tr. 31) \nShe did not know how much the bank lost on the sale of her home. (Tr. 31) Her Chapter \n13 documentation filed in September 2016, indicated the value of her residence was \n$293,609, the amount of the mortgage debts were first mortgage: $417,160 and second \nmortgage: $24,800, and the unsecured portion of the debt was about $148,000. (GE 8 at \n17-18) As of May 3, 2017, her mortgage arrearage was $32,121. (GE 9 at 3) The \nmortgage debt is listed on her October 19, 2018 credit report as a foreclosure account \nwith a last payment in February 2016, a balance of $448,867; however, the past due \namount is zero. (GE 5) The current status of the two mortgage accounts is unspecified in \nher October 19, 2018 credit report. From the information submitted, I infer the foreclosure \nhas been completed, and there is no proof of a deficiency. The debt is resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges an account placed for collection for $80. Applicant said she paid \nthis debt. (SOR response) The debt is resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a past-due debt of $693 on a vehicle loan for $17,892. Applicant \nindicated she was not current on her vehicle payments. (Tr. 31; AE A, email of Feb. 8, \n2019) She said she would provide evidence after the hearing showing the status of the \ndebt; however, she did not provide it. (Tr. 32) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a delinquent debt owed to a city for $2,503; SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges \na delinquent debt owed to a county for $1,765; and SOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a delinquent debt \nowed to a school district for $4,727. These three debts relate to her residence that was \nforeclosed. (Tr. 32-33) While those three debts may have been paid by the mortgage \nlender to ensure clear title for the transfer of the property, Applicant may still owe them. \n(Tr. 33) Applicant did not provide updated status information on the three debts. The three \ndebts are unresolved. \n \nApplicant and her husband\u2019s adjusted gross income on their 2015 federal income \ntax return was $175,760, and she indicated that part of this income included funds from \nher 401(k) account. (Tr. 36) She owed the IRS $22,000 for tax year 2015. (Tr. 36-37)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s budget shows the following monthly amounts: gross income of \n$12,600; net income of $10,071; expenses of $5,801; debt payments of $1,579 (no \npayment to the IRS listed); and net remainder of $2,620. (AE E)  \n \nA manager where Applicant is employed described Applicant as diligent and highly \nmotivated with exceptional potential. He is a retired Navy officer, and he supports \nreinstatement of her security clearance. (AE G) Another manager lauded her work \nperformance, positive attitude, and effectiveness. (AE H) \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing statement concluded: \n \nI am not trying to avoid my responsibilities, and I am embarrassed that I am \neven in this position in the first place. To begin this process, I am trying to \nwork with the IRS as well as a credit management company. I have the \nupmost respect for my Country and my company and would not put either \nat risk. Just as I love and respect my family and self that is how dearly I hold \nthe responsibility of the clearance. I know if given the opportunity I can work \non my finances and clear the concerns that this has set for the granting of \nthe Security Clearance. (AE F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g allege, and Applicant admitted \nthat she owes federal income taxes totaling about $40,000 for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011 \nand 2014. Her historical financial record shows a mortgage foreclosure, delinquent local \ntaxes, delinquent vehicle loan, and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissed for failure to make \npayments. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;1   \n \n                                            \n1The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in \norder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n  \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNo mitigating conditions apply to all SOR allegations; however, Applicant \npresented some important mitigating information. Applicant and her spouse had multiple \nperiods of unemployment, and she and her spouse currently have separate households. \nThese unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and caused or contributed \nto her financial problems. Applicant is credited with mitigating several SOR allegations. \nAlmost all of her federal income tax returns were timely filed, and at present all of them \nare filed. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are mitigated. The dismissal of her Chapter 13 and her \nmortgage foreclosure were caused by unemployment, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are \nmitigated. She said she paid the debt for $80, and SOR \u00b6 1.j is mitigated. \n \nApplicant owes about $75,000 in delinquent federal income taxes,2 and she has \nbeen employed since August 2017. Her tax debt is for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, \n                                            \n2 Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges a federal income tax debt of $40,828 in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g. The \nSOR does not allege that she owes a total of about $75,000 in delinquent federal income taxes for tax years \nin addition to those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be \nconsidered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nand 2015. She under withheld federal income taxes from her pay, and did not pay her \nfederal income taxes in full when due. She has not been making payments to the IRS \nsince August 2017, when she resumed employment.  \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [the applicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is \nnow motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful \nconsideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course \nof conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support \napproval of access to classified information).   \n \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence of progress resolving her delinquent \nfederal income tax debt, her vehicle debt, and three local tax debts pertaining to her \nforeclosed residence. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n                                            \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId.

Oct. 26, 2006)).  \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax debt exceeding $40,828 for additional tax years not alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nthrough 1.g will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nApplicant is 56-year-old supply quality engineer, and she has been employed by \nher current defense-contractor employer since August 2017. In 1987, she married, and \nher children are ages 24 and 27. In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and in \n1986, she received a bachelors of science degree in electrical engineering. She has held \na security clearance for 28 years, and there is no evidence that she ever compromised \nclassified information.   \n \nA manager where Applicant is employed described Applicant as diligent and highly \nmotivated with exceptional potential. Another manager lauded her work performance, \npositive attitude, and effectiveness. Her employment record supports reinstatement of her \nsecurity clearance. \n \nWhen Applicant and her spouse were unemployed, her family income was \nsignificantly reduced and her debts became delinquent. Applicant and her husband had \nto arrange separate households because of their employment in different states. I have \ntaken into consideration these circumstances beyond her control; however, she did not \nestablish her financial responsibility once she obtained employment. She owed three local \ntax debts related to her foreclosed residence, and she did not establish resolution of the \nthree debts or payment plans. She did not establish that her vehicle loan is current.  \n \nMost importantly, Applicant has a history of delinquent federal income taxes. Her \ncurrent tax debt totals about $75,000 for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2015.3 \nWhen an issue involving taxes arises, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nthe tax debt arose and the payment history on the tax debt.4 She did not provide a good \nreason for failing to resume payments once she obtained employment in August 2017.  \n                                            \n3 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d). \n \n4 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s \ncontrol adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s \nwages, and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and \ninsufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and \ncited applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. He failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish \nmitigation with respect to his student loan debts and delinquent federal taxes. National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented effective June 8, 2017.  \n01/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 7, 2018, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nits file of relevant material (FORM) on June 6, 2018. Applicant received it on June 15, \n2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. The FORM notified \nApplicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant submitted \na one-page response to the FORM (Response). Items 1 through 6 and the Response are \nadmitted into the record without objection. The case was assigned to me on January 8, \n2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is a high school graduate, and attended some college \nclasses between 2007 and 2010. He has worked for his employer, a federal contractor, \nsince October 2016. He is unmarried and has a ten-year-old child. He is current on his \nchild support obligation. (Item 2.)  \n \n \nApplicant was employed from 2012 to 2016 as a forklift operator. Before that, he \nworked in retail from 2008 to 2012. He also worked at a fast food restaurant in 2008. \nThese jobs were low paying positions and did not afford him sufficient income to repay \nhis student loans that he incurred while attending college. (Item 2; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is alleged to be indebted on 11 delinquent student loan accounts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, and 1.f-1.l) owed to the U.S. Department of Education, totaling $32,442. He \npresented a payment agreement with a collection agency for the U.S. Department of \nEducation dated April 26, 2018, with his Answer to the SOR. That letter authorized \nrecurring payments to be withdrawn from his account, but did not state a payment amount \nor otherwise document any payments were made under that agreement. In Applicant\u2019s \nResponse, he indicated that he consolidated his delinquent student loans into one \naccount and that since April 2018, he has remitted $22 per month as required in the \nrepayment agreement. His June 5, 2018 credit report reflects multiple accounts owed to \nthe Department of Education as past due with the date of last payment as April 2018. It \nis unclear if he made any payments after his the April 2018 payment, which was \npresumably the first payment under his repayment agreement. His June 5, 2018 credit \nreport also shows multiple other student loans were transferred or sold. Applicant did not \nprovide enough evidence to establish a track record of responsibility for these delinquent \nstudent loan accounts. These debts are unresolved. (Answer; Response; Item 3; Item 4; \nItem 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant also owes approximately $2,812 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) to the university he \nattended for another student loan. His Answer and Response indicate that all of his \nstudent loans have been \u201cconsolidated into one monthly payment plan\u201d but there is no \nevidence that indicates this debt was included in that agreement. This debt became \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndelinquent in 2011. It is identified on his June 5, 2018 credit report as past due and no \nrecent payments are reflected. This debt is unresolved. (Answer; Response; Item 3 at 7; \nItem 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $5,284 for tax years \n2014, 2015, and 2016, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. He filed his tax returns for those years \nin a timely manner, but had insufficient funds to pay the balance owed. Tax transcripts for \nthose tax years reflect that he established an installment agreement with the IRS to \nresolve his delinquencies in April 2017, but was no longer in installment status in March \n2018. (Item 3.) He documented that he re-engaged the IRS in April 2018 and established \na new agreement to pay $64 per month. (Answer.) In his Response, he indicated he was \ncurrent with that agreement, but provided no documentation to show a track record of \npayments under that agreement.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s June 5, 2018 credit report reflects that he has an additional delinquent \naccount, owed to a payday-loan vender in the amount of $616. (Item 6.)1 He admitted this \ndebt in his Response and explained: \u201cIn my current financial situation, I am living \n\u2018paycheck to paycheck\u2019, meaning, after I am finished paying my monthly rent and utilities \nand other expenses that are required raising my son, I am not left with extra funds.\u201d \nDespite his shortfall, he intends to pay all his delinquent debt when he is able. \n(Response.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n                                                          \n1 These debts were not alleged on the SOR and are not considered under the disqualifying conditions, \nbelow, but are appropriate to examine when analyzing mitigation. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under the financial considerations guideline is set out in AG \n& 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has over $35,000 in delinquent student loan debt, plus over $5,000 in \ndelinquent tax debt. He has been delinquent on his student loans since at least 2011. \nDespite being fully employed since 2016, he has insufficient income to address these \nliabilities. There is sufficient evidence to establish disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c), and 19(f). \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant has insufficient income to meet all of his financial obligations. He has \nincurred additional delinquent debt, not alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence that he \nwill be able to avoid delinquent accounts in the future. He remains indebted for federal \ntaxes and student loans. His debt is ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to underemployment. That is a \ncircumstance beyond his control. However, he has been fully employed since 2016, and \ncontinues to be unable to meaningfully address his delinquent accounts. The record lacks \ndocumentation to show he reasonably and responsibly addressed his delinquencies. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation of financial counseling. There is minimal \nevidence to conclude that his financial problems are under control. He has established \npayment agreements with the collection agent for the majority of his student loans and \nwith the IRS. However, he did not provide documentation to demonstrate a track record \nof payments in accordance with those agreements. The evidence does not establish full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \n \nApplicant did not claim to dispute any of his alleged delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has established an installment agreement to resolve his federal tax \nliabilities. However, he defaulted on a previous installment agreement. He failed to meet \nhis burden to establish compliance with his current repayment agreement, beyond his \nbare averment. Documentation of compliance with those arrangements is necessary. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) does not mitigate the security concern. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited with his \nrecent efforts to make payment arrangements to resolve his delinquencies with his limited \nincome. However, he failed to support his statements with proof of concomitant action. \nHe has no track record of payments to his creditors and his most recent credit report \nreflects a new delinquent account. He may be eligible for national security eligibility in the \nfuture if he is able to document reasonable and responsible actions to maintain solvency. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86)1 on \nMay 23, 2017. On March 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F.2 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 17, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of \n1 Also known as a Security Clearance Application (SCA). \n2 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n02/26/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing on July 31, 2018, and the hearing was convened on August 28, 2018. \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, were admitted \nin evidence without objection. The record was held open to permit Applicant time to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. She submitted AE B, which was admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old business analyst for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 2002. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1998, and completed some credits toward \na master\u2019s degree. She married in 1993 and has one child and one stepchild. She has \nheld a security clearance since 2002. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant is indebted on three debts \ntotaling approximately $24,405. Applicant admitted the allegations, and provided a \nstatement explaining the circumstances for the debts. \n \n \nApplicant lived in state A and worked for her current employer. Her spouse is a \nretired civil service employee and also worked after retiring from the Government, in state \nA. In September 2007, Applicant was transferred to state B to continue working for the \nsame employer in a different location. At the time, the housing market was declining, and \nApplicant\u2019s home appraised for less than the mortgage. Hoping the market would recover, \nshe kept the home and listed it for rent in February 2008. The monthly rental income was \nhalf of the mortgage payment. At the same time, Applicant purchased another home in \nstate B. Her spouse left his employment and moved to state B with Applicant in June \n2008. In November 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse suffered from a serious heart condition. In \n2014, he was diagnosed with final stage renal failure, and in 2015, underwent quintuple \ncardiac bypass surgery. He never returned to work after 2009, leaving the family with \nApplicant\u2019s income alone, two mortgages and other debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s home in state A was not generating sufficient income and she \nexhausted all of her savings to make up the difference in mortgage payments until 2009. \nSince the real estate market had not recovered, Applicant was forced to allow the home \nto be foreclosed. The lender took possession in 2010, and sold the home in 2011 for less \nthan half of the original mortgage amount. She does not owe a deficiency from the \nforeclosure. \n \nIn 2009, a credit card provider closed Applicant\u2019s and her spouse\u2019s accounts. This \nparticular credit card provider requires full payment of the charged amount each month. \nAlthough Applicant made payments on the accounts until 2012, she stopped when she \nwas no longer financially able to pay this debt and other debts. She described the action \nas a \u201cstrategic decision\u2019 to forgo payments on the credit cards in order to pay other debts \nand have sufficient income for her family. In October 2013, Applicant received letters from \nthe creditor showing the debts were nonrecourse, and that no legal action would be \npermitted to collect the debts. Applicant\u2019s September 2018 credit report shows that the \naccounts were closed and charged off several years ago, but notes the accounts were \n\n \n3 \n \nnever late. Applicant submitted disputes to the credit bureaus requesting that they \ndiscontinue reporting the accounts on her credit report. Another small medical debt listed \nin the SOR was paid. \n \nApplicant paid five other credit cards in 2015 and 2016, totaling about $20,000. \nThe family now has manageable debts including one credit card, a mortgage, and a \nstudent loan from Applicant and her son. Applicant inquired into employer-sponsored \ncredit counseling, but none was offered. She self-educated online, and produced a family \nbudget showing a take-home income of $95,000, a net monthly remainder of $1,116 after \npaying expenses, $4,000 in cash savings, and a 401(k) retirement account valued at \n$366,000. Applicant\u2019s testimony was forthcoming and sincere, and as suggested at her \nhearing, she provided explanatory information in her post-hearing submission. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts, and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence supporting the SOR \nallegations are sufficient to establish the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems occurred after she was transferred to another state \nand her spouse was unable to work again due to a serious medical condition. Faced with \na single family income, two mortgages, and a sick spouse, Applicant had to make financial \nchoices to pay some debts but not others. She contacted the creditor for two of the SOR \ndebts and discussed her family\u2019s financial status, but was unable to make the required \nfull payments on the accounts. The two credit-card debts from the same creditor were \nclosed and charged-off some time ago, and there is no recourse permitted against \nApplicant. Applicant has disputed their continued reporting on her credit report, but the \nreports show the payments were \u201cnever late.\u201d About $20,000 in other debts were paid in \nlieu of payment on these credit cards. These debts have been sufficiently addressed and \nresolved. The remaining small medical debt has been paid.  \n \n \nApplicant is now on solid financial footing. Her family income from her work and \nher husband\u2019s civil service pension are more than sufficient for her to meet all of her \nfinancial responsibilities. Despite a history of financial delinquencies due to circumstances \nbeyond her control, Appellant has now shown a track record of responsible financial \ndecisions and there is sufficient evidence to determine that she is living within her means. \nI find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances to address her debts with \nthe only means at her disposal given her difficult financial condition. Her financial \ncondition no longer casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) apply; and \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (e) partially apply. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has \nundergone significant financial stress through no fault of her own, but acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. She allocated resources within her means to address debts as \nshe could, and the remaining two SOR debts were closed and charged-off without \nrecourse several years ago. I am convinced that a similar financial event is unlikely to \nrecur and that Applicant is financially stable. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \neligibility is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 14, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant security clearance eligibility for him. \nThe DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Nat. Sec. Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn April 21, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting \nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.m, and 1q through 1.t, and neither admitting, nor denying \n12/26/2018\n\n2 \n \nsubparagraphs 1.n through 1.p. He requested a decision based on the written record rather \nthan a hearing. On June 5, 2018, Department Counsel prepared a file of relevant material \n(FORM).  Applicant received the FORM on June 21, 2018, and was notified that he could \nfile a reply, together with attachments supplementing the information in the FORM, if \ndesired. He did not file a reply. The FORM was assigned to me on August 6, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant is a 47-year-old man. He and his wife have been married since 1995, but \nseparated since 2009. (Item 3 at 25) They have three adult children and one teenager. \nApplicant and his girlfriend with whom he has been living since 2016, have a one-year-old \nchild. \n \n \nApplicant is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, serving from 1988 to 2009. He \nretired honorably. (Item 3 at 21) He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2007, a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2009, and a master\u2019s degree in 2012. Since 2016, he has worked for a defense \ncontractor as a program manager, where he earns $140,000 annually. (Item 4 at 13)  He \nhas held a security clearance since 1991. (Item 3 at 2) \n \n \nBetween 2009 and 2016, Applicant incurred approximately $61,000 of delinquent \ndebt, consisting of automobile loans, student loans, consumer debt, utilities, and medical \naccounts. Applicant also failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2010, and 2012 through 2015. (Item 3 at 3) \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to the challenge of maintaining his \nestranged wife\u2019s household by sending her $1,500 per month after they separated. (Item 3 \nat 5 ; Item 5 at 4) The failure to file federal and state income taxes, as mentioned in the \nprevious paragraph, occurred because of a lack of communication with his estranged wife, \nas unbeknownst to him, she was filing her tax returns individually. (Item 3 at 5)  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b are auto loans, with balances totaling approximately \n$56,000. Applicant used the loan account alleged in subparagraph 1.a to finance the \npurchase of a car for $42,000 in 2014. (Item 7 at 1) He used the loan account alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.b to finance the purchase of a car in 2016 for $25,000. (Item 8 at 10) \nApplicant paid the past due balances on these bills in March 2018 after receiving the SOR. \n(Item 3 at 12, 14) They are no longer in delinquent status. \n \n \nThe debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, 1.f  through 1.h, and 1.j are delinquent \nstudent loan accounts. Their collective balance totals approximately $29,000. Applicant \ncaught up on these accounts with a $461 payment in March 2018, after receiving the SOR. \n(Item 3 at 18)  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e, totaling $4,349, is a credit card account. In \nMarch 2018, after receiving the SOR, Applicant pre-authorized recurring $150 bi-weekly \npayments, scheduled to have begun in April 2018. (Item 3 at 15) \n \n\n3 \n \n \n   Subparagraph 1.i, totaling $1,191, is a utility bill. Applicant paid $500 toward its \nsatisfaction in March 2018, after receiving the SOR. (Item 3 at 20) Subparagraph 1.k, \ntotaling $596, is a phone bill. Applicant satisfied this debt in its entirety in March 2018, after \nreceiving the SOR.  (Item 3 at 22) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax delinquency, totaling $32,273, is alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.l. He filed the delinquent tax returns in approximately April 2017. (Item 6) \nAt or about that time, he arranged a payment plan under which he was to pay the IRS \n$1,800 per month. (Item 6) Six months later, in October 2017, he renegotiated the payment \nplan. Under the new agreement, the IRS reduced the payments from $1,800 monthly to \n$800 monthly, to be deducted from his checking account.  (Item 3 at 24) He presented no \nevidence of compliance with either plan. Applicant provided no evidence that he ever filed \nhis delinquent state income tax returns. \n \n \nApplicant owes the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.m, totaling $587, to a credit \nunion. He satisfied it in March 2018. (Item 3 at 23). \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n through 1.p, totaling approximately $12,000 are loan accounts \nthat Applicant and his wife used to purchase furniture before their separation in 2009. As of \nJuly 2017, he was working with a credit counseling agency to help him resolve these debts. \n(Item 1 at 10-11; Item 5 at 6)  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q and 1.r are medical bills totaling approximately $137. These bills \nhave been outstanding since 2014. (Item 8 at 21) Applicant is attempting to ascertain which \nof his dependents incurred these bill so that he can file them with the appropriate insurer. \n(Item 3 at 3) Currently, Applicant is preparing to obtain a legal separation from his wife, in \norder to minimize further confusion with respect to management of his finances. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies trigger the application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to file his state and federal income taxes for tax years 2010, \nand 2012 through 2015 triggers the application of AG \u00b6 20(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently \nfiling annual federal, state, or local income tax returns, or failure to pay federal, state, or \nlocal income tax, as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n\n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant attributes much of his financial problems to his marital separation. \nHowever, this occurred nearly ten years ago.  Since then, he has financed the purchase of \ntwo new cars, one of which was in excess of $40,000. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has brought his car loan accounts and his student loan accounts current \nby satisfying the respective delinquencies, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d, 1.f \nthrough 1.h, and 1.j, and he has satisfied the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.i. and 1.m in \ntheir entirety. The satisfaction of these debts is sufficient to apply AG \u00b6 20(d) and to \nresolve these SOR allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant provided evidence that he filed his delinquent federal income tax returns, \nand provided evidence of a payment plan and a revised payment, but he provided no \nevidence that he has complied with either plan. Moreover, he provided no evidence that he \nhas filed his delinquent state income tax returns. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(g) is inapplicable \nto the issue of Applicant\u2019s non-filed state income tax returns, and it is only applicable to his \ndelinquent federal income tax returns insofar as he has filed them and made arrangements \nto satisfy them.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide evidence of either federal tax payment plan compliance \nor of filing his delinquent state income taxes undercuts any positive inference from his work \nwith a credit counselor or the progress made at debt reduction. Therefore, I conclude that \nonly the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1 They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n \n\n6 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant deserves credit for initiating payment plans and for satisfying some of his \ndebts. However, he did not make plans to pay many of these debts until after the issuance \nof the SOR. Moreover, he has yet to file his delinquent state income tax returns, and he \nhas provided no evidence that he is complying with the payment plan for his federal income \ntax delinquencies. Failure to file tax returns or to pay income tax debts are serious \ntransgressions as they suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-\nestablished government rules and regulations. (ADP Case No. 16-03595 (August 27, 2018) \nat 4) Under these circumstances, any indicia of financial rehabilitation is outweighed by the \nnature and seriousness of the problem. Consequently, I am unable to conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n \u2013 1.r:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The specific \nissues raised are listed in DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative \nStandards, and Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards. The overriding factor \nfor all of these conditions is unacceptable risk.  \n                                                          \n1 Items 1, 5. \n \n2 Items 2, 5. \n \n3 Items 2, 4. \n \n\n \n3 \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

(DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \u00b6 1)  \n \nAnalysis \n \nEmployment Misconduct \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 1. provides: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s misconduct or negligence in \nemployment, that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \na. An individual\u2019s employment misconduct or negligence may put people, \nproperty, or information systems at risk. \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 1.b lists several conditions that could raise a CAC eligibility concern and \nmay be disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(1) A previous history of intentional wrongdoing on the job, disruptive, \nviolent, or other acts that may pose an unacceptable risk to people, \nproperty, or information systems;  \n \n(4) Violation of written or recorded commitments to protect information \nmade to an employer, such as breach(es) of confidentiality or the release \nof proprietary or other information; and  \n \n(5) Failure to comply with rules or regulations for the safeguarding of \nclassified, sensitive, or other protected information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment termination due to her disclosure of confidential patient \ninformation in violation of federal law is sufficient to establish the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 1.c lists circumstances relevant to the determination whether there is a \n\n \n4 \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. The following may be \nrelevant:  \n \n(1) The behavior happened so long ago, was minor, or happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current trustworthiness or good judgment relating \nto the safety of people and proper safeguarding of property and \ninformation systems;  \n \n(2) The individual was not adequately warned that the conduct was \nunacceptable and could not reasonably be expected to know that the \nconduct was wrong;  \n \n(3) The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the behavior; \nand \n  \n(4) The individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial training \nand has since demonstrated a positive attitude toward the discharge of \ninformation-handling or security responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination for committing a HIPPA violation was recent and \nsignificant enough to cost Applicant her nursing job of 18 years. Applicant failed to \nproduce sufficient evidence establishing any of the circumstances listed above.  \n \nIntentional False Statement \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 3 provides: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s material, intentional false statement, \ndeception or fraud in connection with federal or contract employment, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.  \n \na. The individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s honesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nput people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \nb. Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include material, \nintentional falsification, deception or fraud related to answers or \ninformation provided during the employment process for the current or a \nprior federal or contract employment (e.g., on the employment application \nor other employment, appointment or investigative documents, or during \ninterviews.) \n \n\n \n5 \nApplicant was fired from a job she held for 18 years because of her misconduct \nin violating federal law. Less than three months later, she completed a FORM 306. I find \nit implausible that Applicant would not remember a significant life event when \ncompleting the form. It is reasonable to infer that she intentionally failed to disclose this \ninformation because she was afraid it would harm her chances at obtaining the job. The \nabove disqualifying conditions are established.  \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 3.c lists circumstances relevant to the determination whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. The following may be \nrelevant: \n \n(1) The misstated or omitted information was so long ago, was minor, or \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \nand \n \n(2) The misstatement or omission was unintentional or inadvertent and \nwas followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s false statement was recent and significant because it concerned her \nfiring from her most recent employer for a federal law violation concerning unauthorized \ndisclosure of confidential information. Her actions were intentional and she did not \nengage in efforts to correct the situation. Neither mitigating circumstance applies. \n \nI am unable to determine that future employment misconduct or intentionally \nfalse statements are unlikely to recur. There is insufficient mitigation in the FORM to \nconvince me that Applicant does not pose an unacceptable risk. I also considered the \nfactors in DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \u00b6 1. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Employment Misconduct:    \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Intentional False Statement:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, granting \nApplicant CAC eligibility poses an unacceptable risk. CAC eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGoldstein, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing eligibility concerns for Common Access Card \n(CAC) issuance pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive\u201312 (HSPD-12) \nbecause it found it was an unacceptable risk to grant Applicant CAC eligibility. The \naction is based on the Adjudicative Standards found in DoD Instruction 5200.46, DoD \nInvestigative and Adjudicative Guidelines for Issuing the Common Access Card, dated \nSeptember 9, 2014, and made pursuant to the procedures set out in Enclosure 3 of \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The concerns raised under the \nAdjudicative Standards of DoDI 5200.46 are: paragraph 1.a - misconduct or negligence \nin employment; and paragraph 3.a - material, intentional false statement, deception, or \nfraud.   \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 18, 2018 (Answer), and requested a \ndecision based on the record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) on September 26, 2018. Applicant received it on October 1, \n2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 5. The FORM notified \nApplicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n02/13/2019\n\n \n2 \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of her receipt of the FORM. On November 14, \n2018, Applicant submitted a 4-page response to the FORM (Response). Items 1 \nthrough 5 and the Response are admitted into the record without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 16, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. She is a high school graduate. She has worked for her \nemployer since August 2017. (Item 3.) \n \n \nOn June 8, 2017, Applicant was involuntarily terminated by her prior employer for \nstealing money from another employee\u2019s purse. She indicated she \u201cimmediately \nregretted\u201d her decision and \u201ctried to put the money back\u201d but was caught in the act. A \ndisciplinary action form from Applicant\u2019s former employer documents the theft. (Item 5; \nAnswer.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s material, intentional false statement, deception, \nor fraud raised concerns under DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, Supplemental \nAdjudicative Standards. Specifically, it alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on a \nDeclaration for Federal Employment form (306), signed by Applicant on September 26, \n2017, when she failed to disclose she was discharged by her employer in June 2017. \nShe answered \u201cNo\u201d on that declaration to the question that asked whether in the past \nfive years she had been fired, quit after being told she would be fired, or left a job by \nmutual agreement because of specific problems. She admitted that she \u201cdidn\u2019t think \n[she] would get the job if [she] checked yes.\u201d (Item 4; Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for being dishonest. She has worked hard to be a \ntop performer for her current employer. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant presented four letters of recommendation from supervisors and \ncoworkers. The first letter indicated that Applicant was recognized as the employee of \nthe month during her first 90 days of employment and is trustworthy. Her program \nmanager believes she has dedication, character, and dependability required for the job. \nHer deputy program manager finds her character to be \u201cbeyond reproach.\u201d Her team \nlead believes Applicant to be honest, hardworking, and a motivated team player. \n(Response.) \n \nPolicies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The HSPD-12 \ncredentialing standards are listed in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic \nAdjudicative Standards, and Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards. The \noverriding factor for all of these eligibility criteria is unacceptable risk.  \n \nThe objective of CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \n\n \n3 \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. Each case must be judged on its own merits, \ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, \nmature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; \n(3) the recency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or \npresence of efforts towards rehabilitation. (DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, paragraph 1.)  \n \nAnalysis \n \nSupplemental Adjudicative Standards, Paragraph 1.a \n \n \nDoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards \nexpresses concerns pertaining to misconduct or negligence in employment. Paragraph \n1 of this section states: \n \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s misconduct or negligence in \nemployment, that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.   \n \na. An individual\u2019s employment misconduct or negligence may \nput people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \n \nThe disqualifying condition set forth in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, \nSubparagraph 1.b that is raised by Applicant\u2019s misconduct or negligence in employment \nis: \n \n(1) A previous history of intentional wrongdoing on the job, disruptive, \nviolent, or other acts that may pose an unacceptable risk to people, \nproperty, or information systems. \n \n \nApplicant was terminated because she stole from another employee in June \n2017. Her conduct raises a significant concern because it is disruptive to the workplace. \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nPotentially mitigating conditions are set forth in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \nAppendix 2, Subparagraph 1.c. The conditions that could apply to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the evidence in this case are: \n \n\n \n4 \n(1) The behavior happened so long ago, was minor, or happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current trustworthiness or good judgment relating \nto the safety of people and proper safeguarding of property and \ninformation systems; \n \n(2) The individual was not adequately warned that the conduct was \nunacceptable and could not reasonably be expected to know that the \nconduct was wrong; \n \n(3) The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the behavior; \nand \n \n(4) The individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial training \nand has since demonstrated a positive attitude toward the discharge of \ninformation-handling or security responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to take money from the purse of a coworker was recent and \nno unusual circumstances surrounding her theft have been documented. Her \nmisconduct casts doubt on her current trustworthiness or good judgment. While she has \nexpressed remorse for her conduct, and has demonstrated trustworthiness in her \ncurrent position, not enough time has passed since the theft to show rehabilitation, in \nlight of her falsification discussed below. The concern is not mitigated. \n \nSupplemental Adjudicative Standards, Paragraph 3.a \n \n \nDoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards \nexpresses concerns pertaining to misconduct or negligence in employment. Paragraph \n3 of this section states: \n \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s material, intentional false statement, \ndeception, or fraud in connection with federal or contract employment, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.   \n \na. The individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nhonesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and put people, property, \nor information systems at risk. \n \nb. Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include \nmaterial, intentional falsification, deception or fraud related to \nanswers or information provided during the employment \nprocess for the current or a prior federal or contract \nemployment (e.g., on the employment application or other \n\n \n5 \nemployment, appointment or investigative documents, or \nduring interviews.) \n \n \nThe disqualifying conditions set forth in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, \nSubparagraph 3.b are raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification on her Declaration for Federal \nEmployment form (306), signed on September 26, 2017. She admitted her falsification \nin her Answer.  \n \n \nPotentially mitigating conditions are set forth in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \nAppendix 2, Subparagraph 3.c. The conditions that could apply to mitigate the \nunacceptable risk concerns raised by the evidence in this case are: \n \n(1) The misstated or omitted information was so long ago, was minor, or \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \nand \n \n(2) The misstatement or omission was unintentional or inadvertent and \nwas followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation. \n \n \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above in Subparagraph 3.c, it \nis apparent that neither of them were established in this case. Applicant\u2019s falsification \nwas recent. Falsifying material information raises serious concerns and Applicant has \ndone little to show that similar dishonesty is unlikely to recur. While she has gained the \ntrust of her supervisors and coworkers, there is no evidence that the authors of the \nletters knew of the allegations on the SOR. Applicant did not make prompt or good-faith \nefforts to correct her falsification and concealment. She has not provided sufficient \nevidence to meet her burden of proof to overcome her material, intentional false \nstatement in connection with her federal employment. \n \nFurther Mitigation \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, CAC Adjudicative Procedures, Paragraph 1, \nGuidance For Applying Credentialing Standards During Adjudication provides the \nfollowing: \n \na. As established in Reference (g), credentialing adjudication considers \nwhether or not an individual is eligible for long-term access to federally \ncontrolled facilities and/or information systems. The ultimate determination \nto authorize, deny, or revoke the CAC based on a credentialing \ndetermination of the PSI must be made after consideration of applicable \ncredentialing standards in Reference (c).  \n \nb. Each case is unique. Adjudicators must examine conditions that raise \nan adjudicative concern, the overriding factor for all of these conditions is \nunacceptable risk. Factors to be applied consistently to all information \navailable to the adjudicator are: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct. The more serious \nthe conduct, the greater the potential for an adverse CAC determination. \n \n \n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Sufficient \ninformation concerning the circumstances of the conduct must be obtained \nto determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the conduct \nposes a risk to people, property or information systems. \n \n \n(3) The recency and frequency of the conduct. More recent or more \nfrequent conduct is of greater concern.  \n \n \n(4) The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct. \nOffenses committed as a minor are usually treated as less serious than \nthe same offenses committed as an adult, unless the offense is very \nrecent, part of a pattern, or particularly heinous. \n \n \n(5) Contributing external conditions. Economic and cultural \nconditions may be relevant to the determination of whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk if the conditions \nare currently removed or countered (generally considered in cases with \nrelatively minor issues). \n \n \n(6) The absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation, if \nrelevant, to address conduct adverse to CAC determinations. \n \n \n    (a) Clear, affirmative evidence of rehabilitation is required for a \nfavorable adjudication (e.g., seeking assistance and following professional \nguidance, where appropriate; demonstrating positive changes in behavior \nand employment). \n \n \n   (b) Rehabilitation may be a consideration for most conduct, not \njust alcohol and drug abuse. While formal counseling or treatment may be \na consideration, other factors (such as the individual\u2019s employment record) \nmay also be indications of rehabilitation. \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence of recent good character at her present employer \nincluding being awarded employee of the month. While she offered four letters of \nsupport, they failed to acknowledge they knew about her prior criminal conduct. Her \ntheft and her falsification were recent and material. She has not demonstrated she has \nthe requisite judgment to have CAC eligibility. There is a reasonable basis to conclude \nthat Applicant represents an unacceptable risk for the U.S. Government. Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for CAC eligibility is denied. \n \n\n \n7 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nSOR Paragraph 1:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSOR Paragraph 2:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is an \nunacceptable risk to grant Applicant CAC eligibility.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On March 5, 2018, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on June \n8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR, with attachments, on April 5, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.

(Government \nExhibits 5 and 6.)   \n \n \nApplicant argued that a long and arduous divorce proceeding from his now ex-wife \nwas the primary cause of all of his financial issues. According to Applicant, he had to pay \nexcessive spouse and child support, as well as his ex-wife\u2019s attorney fees. Eventually, he \nwas unable to maintain payments on his debts. Only recently has he been able to begin \nto resolve his debts. (Applicant Exhibits G, H, and K; Tr. 26-29, 59-62.) \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed several unpaid student loans, as set forth in \nthis allegation and SOR allegation 1.j. Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement \nconcerning all of his student loans, totaling approximately $61,646. Beginning in March \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n2018, Applicant began making monthly payments of $240 a month. Applicant had made \nseven payments as of the date the record closed. Once he has made nine payments in \nten months, his loans will be taken out of default status and then regular payments can \nbegin. His actions are sufficient to show a good-faith effort to resolve this debt. This debt \nis being resolved through agreed payments. (Applicant Exhibits V and L; Tr. 28-34, 79-\n80, 88-89.)  \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $15,958 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made \nany payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company \non August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness. The \nagreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the \ndebt relief company will attempt to make payment arrangements with his creditors. \nApplicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the \nrecord closed. One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 34-36, 39-40, 81-83; Applicant \nExhibit BB.)  \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $3,245 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made \nany payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company \non August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness. The \nagreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the \ndebt relief company will attempt to make payment arrangements with his creditors. \nApplicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the \nrecord closed. One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 38-40, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit \nBB.)   \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $2,889 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made \nany payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company \non August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness. The \nagreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the \ndebt relief company will attempt to make payment arrangements with his creditors. \nApplicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the \nrecord closed. One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 39-40, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit \nBB.) \n \n \n1.e Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $2,701 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made \nany payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company \non August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness. The \nagreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ndebt relief company will attempt to make payment arrangements with his creditors. \nApplicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the \nrecord closed.

Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $2,012 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. Applicant admitted to this allegation on the record. Applicant entered \ninto an agreement with a debt relief company on August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve \nthis and other past-due indebtedness. The agreement posits that Applicant will make \nmonthly payments of $290, out of which the debt relief company will attempt to make \npayment arrangements with his creditors. Applicant made his first payment on September \n7, 2018, which is the only one before the record closed. One payment is insufficient to \nshow that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve this debt. This debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. 39-41, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit BB.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $695 for a past-due \ncredit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record. Pursuant to a motion from the \nGovernment, and in accordance with the evidence, the SOR was amended to show the \ntrue amount owed as $6,214 in accordance with Directive, Additional Procedural \nGuidance \u00b6 E3.1.17. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company on \nAugust 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness. The \nagreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the \ndebt relief company will attempt to make payment arrangements with his creditors. \nApplicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the \nrecord closed. One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 39-42, 81-87; Applicant Exhibit \nBB.) \n \n \n1.h. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed a utility company \n$241 for a past-due debt. Based on the available evidence I find that Applicant owed this \ndebt. Applicant had not paid this debt as of the date of the hearing and had no current \nplans to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 42-44; Government Exhibit 6.) \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed a utility company \n$125 for a past-due debt. Based on the available evidence I find that Applicant owed this \ndebt. Applicant had not paid this debt as of the date of the hearing and had no current \nplans to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 44; Government Exhibit 6.) \n \n \n1.j. Applicant admitted that he owed several unpaid student loans, as set forth in \nthis allegation and SOR allegation 1.a. Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement \nconcerning all of his student loans, totaling approximately $61,646. Beginning in March \n2018, Applicant began making monthly payments of $240 a month. Applicant had made \nseven payments as of the date the record closed.

(Applicant Exhibits V and L; Tr. 28-34, 79-\n80, 88-89.) \n \n \n1.k. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $2,451 for a past-\ndue debt. He admitted to this allegation on the record. Applicant entered into an \nagreement with a debt relief company on August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and \nother past-due indebtedness. The agreement posits that Applicant will make monthly \npayments of $290, out of which the debt relief company will attempt to make payment \narrangements with his creditors. Applicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, \nwhich is the only one before the record closed. One payment is insufficient to show that \nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. \n39-41, 44-45, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit BB.) \n \n \n1.l. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed a cable company \n$284 for a past-due debt. Applicant retained a credit repair company, which successfully \ndisputed this debt and had it removed from his credit reports. The debt is not on the most \nrecent credit reports in the record provided by the Government and Applicant. It has been \nresolved. (Government Exhibit 6; Applicant Exhibits O, W and AA; Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \n1.m. Applicant denied that he owed a creditor $279 for a past-due debt. Applicant \nretained a credit repair company, which successfully disputed this debt and had it \nremoved from his credit reports. The debt is not on the most recent credit reports in the \nrecord provided by the Government and Applicant. It has been resolved. (Government \nExhibit 6; Applicant Exhibits O, W and AA; Tr. 46-47.) \n \n \n1.n. Applicant denied that he owed a medical creditor $115 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant retained a credit repair company, which disputed this debt. The debt was \nverified by the creditor as a valid debt. Applicant had not paid this debt or made \narrangements to resolve it. It is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibits O, W and AA; Tr. 47-48.) \n \n \n1.o. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed a medical creditor \n$44 for a past-due debt. Applicant retained a credit repair company, which disputed this \ndebt. The debt was verified by the creditor as a valid debt. Applicant had not paid this \ndebt or made arrangements to resolve it. It is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibits O, W and \nAA; Tr. 48.) \n \n \n1.p. Applicant admitted that he did not file his Federal tax returns in a timely fashion \nfor the 2013, 2015, and 2016 tax years. Applicant stated that he could not file his tax \nreturns because he lacked essential information concerning child and spousal support \nduring his divorce, as well as other essential financial information. Applicant further stated \nthat he had filed all of his Federal tax returns. Evidence was submitted showing the \nsuccessful filing of his 2013 and 2015 tax returns in March 2018, and that Applicant had \nattempted to file his 2016 tax return at the same time. Applicant does not owe any back \ntaxes. (Tr. 48-52, 63-72; Applicant Exhibits I, J, Y, Z, and EE.) \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \n1.q. Applicant admitted that he did not file his state tax returns in a timely fashion \nfor the 2013, 2015, and 2016 tax years. Applicant stated that he could not file his tax \nreturns because he lacked essential information concerning child and spousal support \nduring his divorce. Applicant further stated that he had filed all of his state tax returns in \napproximately March 2018. Evidence was submitted showing that all of the tax returns in \nissue had been filed with his state taxing authority. Applicant does not owe any back \ntaxes. (Tr. 48-52, 72; Applicant Exhibits I and DD.) \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant has had a successful career. Several co-workers, including supervisors, \nrecommend him for a position of trust. He is described as a person who is \u201cethical,\u201d \n\u201creliable,\u201d and \u201cdependable.\u201d The most recent performance appraisal in the record shows \nthat he \u201cMeets Job Requirements.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits A and F.) \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state tax returns, as required, for at least \nthree years. In addition, there are substantial past-due debts, including student loans. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s substantial financial issues, including failure to \ntimely file tax returns and unpaid bills: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s past-due indebtedness. Two of the debts were \nsuccessfully disputed by Applicant (1.l and 1.m). Those allegations are found for him. In \naddition, he has shown a good-faith effort to resolve his past-due student loans (1.a and \n1.j.) Those allegations are found for him. \n \n Applicant\u2019s past-due debts are long-standing, and he continues to be heavily \nindebted. He still owes approximately $36,000. Mitigating condition \u00b6 20(a) does not apply \nto his remaining unresolved delinquencies. \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long divorce undoubtedly had a serious impact on his ability to resolve \nhis debts. However, entering into a debt relief program literally at the 11th hour, with only \none payment made after the date of the hearing, does not show he has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Mitigating condition \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts that he owed, and his debt relief program \nhad barely started as of the date the record closed. Accordingly, while Applicant may have \ninitiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, it cannot be said that he is adhering to it, \nor that there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. \nMitigating conditions \u00b6 20(c) and (d) do not apply, except to his student loan debt. \n \nApplicant successfully disputed two of the debts. Mitigating condition \u00b620(e) \napplies to those two debts only. \n \nFinally, with regard to his taxes, Applicant submitted evidence that he has filed, \nalbeit late, all of his past-due tax returns. It is obvious that his divorce impacted his ability \nto properly file his taxes. Under the unique circumstances of this case, particularly since \nApplicant does not owe back taxes, SOR allegations 1.p and 1.q are found for Applicant.  \n \nAs stated, SOR allegations 1.a, j, l, and m are also found for Applicant. With those \nexceptions, Applicant did not mitigate his financial issues. Guideline F is found against \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nsufficient evidence to show that the majority of his unpaid debts had been responsibly \naddressed, or were being resolved. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress \nremains undiminished. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l through 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n through 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p through 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.
