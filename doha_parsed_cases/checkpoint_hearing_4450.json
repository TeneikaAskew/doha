Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 18, 2022. \nOn November 7, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nThe DoD acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 12, 2022, and he submitted an \nadditional answer on February 20, 2023, and requested a decision on the written record \nwithout a hearing.

Applicant did not submit a \nresponse. The case was transferred to me on May 14, 2024. \nThe SOR and the Answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. FORM \nItems 3 through 6 and the Response enclosures are admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Admission of FORM Item 6 is discussed below. \nEvidentiary Issue \nThe FORM included a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted \non October 27, 2023. (Item 6). The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, \ndeletions, or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated. He did not object to the PSI in his Response. I conclude that he \nwaived any objections to the PSI summary by failing to object to the PSI in his Response. \n\u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to \ntake timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). FORM Item 6 is therefore admitted. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR he admitted all nine allegations under Guideline \nF. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h involve delinquent student loans and SOR \u00b6 1.i is a credit card \naccount placed for collection. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 26 years old. He is married and has three children. He graduated high \nschool in 2008. He lists attending community college from 2011 to the present but has \nnot received a degree. (Item 3 at 10.) He received his security clearance in 2016 when \nhe was employed by a federal contractor as a systems administrator for a federal \ndepartment. Prior to his current position, he worked in various retail positions after high \nschool. From 2009 until he obtained his current position, he worked in loss prevention, \nand he cited not being able to find a job that paid more than $11 an hour for his financial \nproblems. In his current position he told the investigator that after expenses and taxes he \nnow has $4,200 per month in income. (Item 6 at 2.) \nApplicant discussed his student loans with the investigator who conducted his PSI. \nHe explained he could not afford the $300-$400 payments because he could not find a \njob. He explained he moved when the loans started to become delinquent in the 2013 to \n2014 time period and he \u201cforgot to update his contact information so he never received \ncollection attempts.\u201d (Item 6 at 2.). The February 2022 credit report shows a last activity \ndate for his student loans as April 2016, with assignment dates of October 2008, \nSeptember 2011, September 2013, and September 2014.

The October 2022 credit report shows the last activity date as April 2016 \nand date of first major delinquency as July 2017 for all of the student loans. (Item 5 at 4-\n6.) March 2020 is the last payment reflected for all of his student loans on the October \n2022 credit report. (Item 5.) I take administrative notice that in March 2020 the U.S. \nDepartment of Education (DOE) announced an administrative forbearance for eligible \nstudent loans, the DOE automatically paused their loan payments and set their interest \nrate to 0%. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. He told the \ninvestigator he had been working with DOE to obtain a \u201cpromissory note\u201d that he further \ndescribed as a payment agreement to bring his account into good standing and that this \neffort had been going on for about a year. (Item 6 at 2.) \nApplicant explained that the credit card account was placed for collection in the \n2017 to 2018 time period. He had stopped using the card and forgot about it. (Item 4 at \n4; Item 6 at 2.) He told the investigator he would pay it off in full \u201cwith[in] a few weeks.\u201d \n(Item 6 at 2.) Five months after the interview the account was not reflected on his October \n2022 credit report. (Item 5.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are established by the evidence: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant's federal student loans were assigned for collection prior to 2020. A \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection \nof national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has \na direct bearing on an applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). The \nabove listed conditions are made applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i, thereby shifting \nthe burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admits his delinquent student loans and he provided no evidence \nshowing actions taken that he discussed in his PSI concerning his student loans, which \nnegatively impacts his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Even if he \nhad made the $40 monthly payments on his student loan delinquencies, which led to \ncollection, the insufficiency of the evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances is determinative. His credit card debt was assigned in October 2018 and \nthe credit report taken five months after his May 2022 PSI does not show the credit card \ndebt. He started his current position in October 2015. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h. AG \u00b6 20(a) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.i. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant experienced several years of \nunderemployment, a condition largely beyond his control. He has not documented his \nstatements concerning his actions before or after March 2020 regarding his handling of \nthe student loans to show that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He \nestimates he has over $4,000 of income per month after expenses and taxes. He started \nhis current position in October 2015. The most recent credit report in the record reflects \nthat Applicant\u2019s student loan delinquencies date back to at least July 2017. The Appeal \nBoard in ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021) addressed this factual \nsituation noting in that case \u201cthe Judge addressed this issue by concluding that, while the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nPresident\u2019s action effectively places Applicant\u2019s student loans in a deferment status, \u201cit \ndoes not excuse Applicant\u2019s past inactions in the context of security clearance eligibility.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant provided no documentary evidence that \nsupports his PSI statements that he had been working with the DOE so that his credit \nreport would reflect him in good standing. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant  \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:  \n \n \n \n    Subparagraph 1.i.: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact There are 14 Federal government student loan allegations and one Federal tax allegation listed in the SOR. Applicant admitted all allegations. Applicant is 30 years old and single with no children. She received a high school diploma in May 2011, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2017. Since September 2020, she has been employed as a material control specialist for a defense contractor. She was an account service representative from February 2018 to September 2020. From July 2014 to February 2018, she was a customer service representative and lead cashier, and also had a second job at a department store distribution center. This is her first investigation and application for a security clearance. (GE 1 at 12-20, 22, 38) Origin of Student Loan Delinquencies After her graduation from a university in June 2017, she knew that she had a grace period of six months before she had to start repaying her student loans. Although she was working two jobs after graduation, she could not repay the loans because she 2 was not earning enough money and she was providing financial help to her mother. She made no attempt to discuss payment options, i.e., deferment, income-based repayments or other options, with the lender, and concluded that since they were not contacting her, or had not garnisheed her wages, that everything was all right. She was not aware of when the student loans went to collections. (GE 4 at 6-7; Tr. 24, 26) Before October 2023, Applicant never made any paymen",

On October 12, 2021, she provided a personal \nsubject interview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated \nAdjudications Services (CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to grant a \nsecurity clearance and issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nNovember 2, 2022, detailing security concerns raised by financial considerations \n(Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken under \nDepartment of Defense2 (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided her answer to the SOR on February 28, 2023.

The hearing was held by Teams video \nteleconference as scheduled. The Government\u2019s exhibits (GE 1 through 4) were \nentered into evidence without objection.

The record remained open until March 7, 2024 to allow Applicant to submit \npost-hearing exhibits. On March 7, 2024, Applicant submitted AE D (an undated \npersonal budget), AE E (certified mail receipts of tax returns to the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) and the state tax agency), AE F (payment receipts for filing of tax returns \nto the IRS and the state tax agency).

The record closed on March 7, 2024. (Tr. 90) \nRulings on Procedure \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding a \nFederal tax allegation under paragraph 1 as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.o \u2013 You failed to timely file, as required, your federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. (Tr. 69) \nApplicant agreed with the amendment. (Tr. 70) The motion to amend the SOR is \ngranted. \nFindings of Fact \nThere are 14 Federal government student loan allegations and one Federal tax \nallegation listed in the SOR. Applicant admitted all allegations. \nApplicant is 30 years old and single with no children. She received a high \nschool diploma in May 2011, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2017. Since September \n2020, she has been employed as a material control specialist for a defense contractor. \nShe was an account service representative from February 2018 to September 2020. \nFrom July 2014 to February 2018, she was a customer service representative and lead \ncashier, and also had a second job at a department store distribution center. This is her \nfirst investigation and application for a security clearance. (GE 1 at 12-20, 22, 38) \nOrigin of Student Loan Delinquencies \nAfter her graduation from a university in June 2017, she knew that she had a \ngrace period of six months before she had to start repaying her student loans.

She \nmade no attempt to discuss payment options, i.e., deferment, income-based \nrepayments or other options, with the lender, and concluded that since they were not \ncontacting her, or had not garnisheed her wages, that everything was all right. She was \nnot aware of when the student loans went to collections. (GE 4 at 6-7; Tr. 24, 26) \nBefore October 2023, Applicant never made any payments on the student \nloans. In her testimony, she indicated that she did not contact the lenders because she \nwas using that money to pay more on other bills. Though she claims the first action she \ntook to pay the lender occurred shortly after her October 2021 PSI, she took no further \naction after the lender indicated that the payments would be $600 to $700 a month. (Tr. \n29) She also believed that the delinquent debt would be forgiven based on her low \nincome or a potential forgiveness program sponsored by the Government to reduce or \neliminate student loan debt. When the Government program never came to fruition, she \ndecided to enroll and make payments in the President\u2019s Fresh Start program. She was \naccepted into the Fresh Start program in January 2023. (Tr. 24, 29-31, AE A; AE G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-1.n \u2013 The 14 accounts listed in the SOR, are displayed in the two \nGovernment credit reports as delinquent in 2018 and transferred for collections. (GE 2 \nat 2-5; GE 3 at 3-7) \nIn October 2023, Applicant began making monthly payments of $322.91 for all \n14 loans under the Fresh Start Program. She has made five monthly payments from \nOctober 2023 through February 2024. She credibly testified that she plans to keep \nmaking the required regular payments until the student loan debts are repaid. With the \ninvaluable assistance from her aunt, she does not foresee this situation recurring. She \nhas no other delinquent debts. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 22-23, 35-37; AE B) \nApplicant was questioned about her $41,000 purchase of a car in November \n2020, a period she claimed that she was living paycheck-to-paycheck. Her answer was \nthat her old car received considerable damage in an accident, and she needed a car. \nThe mechanic told her that her old car would not be worth a lot after it was fixed. The \ndealer convinced her to get another car. Applicant also felt that she was overly \npressured by her mother to purchase the $41,000 car. When she returned to the dealer \nin the fall of 2023 to sell the car back to him, the dealer offered her about half of what \nshe owed for the $41,000 car. (GED 2 at 5; GE 3 at 10; Tr. 42-49) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o \u2013 During her testimony regarding filing Federal and state tax returns, \nApplicant became confused on taxes that she filed over the years. She relied on her \nmother to file Federal and state tax returns with the family tax preparer. She provided \nthe proper paperwork, and she thought her mother turned over the paperwork to the tax \npreparer to file. After receiving a couple of notices from the IRS for missing tax returns \nfor tax years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, Applicant provided documentation showing \nthat the returns were filed on February 13, 2024.

However, their student loans \nwere not delinquent or were not federal student loans. When questioned about whether \nshe knew the loans were delinquent, she conceded that she knew she had not paid the \nloans, but she did not equate her nonpayment of the loans as translating to the loans \nbeing in collections. Based on her conversation with the other individuals, Applicant did \nnot think she needed to disclose the Federal debt. She was not knowledgeable about \nthe loans and did not have money to pay them. When the investigator asked her about \nthe omitted information, she acknowledged the delinquent Federal debt. (Tr. 32-36, 37; \nGE 4) She provided no additional testimony on this issue. \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s aunt testified that Applicant has been living with her for the last six \nmonths, and for a period of time before. The aunt moved her into her home because \nshe knew Applicant was experiencing financial problems. She supplied her views about \nApplicant\u2019s financial and tax problems, and her enigmatic relationship with her mother, \nthe aunt\u2019s sister. At the outset of her testimony, she described Applicant as an honest \nbut na\u00efve person, who occasionally acted on poor advice from her mother and other \nindividuals. Over the years, she provided her mother financial support when she was \nnot in a position to help because of her own financial problems. (Tr. 73-77) \nThe aunt believed Applicant did not disclose her federal student loans on her \nAugust 2021 e-QIP because of poor advice from individuals who were not similarly \nsituated. The aunt did not believe Applicant intentionally falsified the e-QIP. Rather, the \nomission occurred because of Applicant\u2019s naivety and her misunderstanding of the \nimportance of financial matters. (Tr. 77-78) \nAccording to the aunt, Applicant showed the same naivete about her taxes by \nturning most of responsibility for filing her tax returns over to her mother. The aunt \nstressed to Applicant that it is unwise to assume that a relative or associate is going to \nact in her best interests in financial matters. (Tr. 80) \nHer aunt has aided Applicant in establishing an account with the IRS to retrieve \nher Federal tax transcripts. With her aunt\u2019s assistance, Applicant has successfully filed \nthe missing Federal and state tax returns. Applicant is reviewing a book given to her by \nher aunt. The book explores the virtues of budgeting and learning how to bring the \nbudget to life on an Excel spreadsheet program. (Tr. 81-85) \nApplicant\u2019s current manager since July 2022, testified that as a property \nanalyst, Applicant manages and maintains accountability over Federal government \nproperty connected to different programs.

(Tr. 87-89) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law, recognizing the complexities of human behavior. These guidelines \nare applied together with common sense and the general factors of the whole-person \nconcept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires \nthat \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as \nrequired. \nAdverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s \nobligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The two \nGovernment credit reports (GE 3 and GE 4) establish that the 14 delinquent student \nloans debts listed in the SOR became delinquent in 2018. Applicant knew that she had \na six-month grace period after graduating from the university before she was required to \nstart repaying the loans. Her claim that she received no notices from the lender and her \nwages were not garnisheed is irrelevant to her obligation to repay her delinquent loans. \nDuring her October 2021 PSI, Applicant was placed on official notice that her delinquent \nloans posed a security concern to the Government, when she acknowledged the loans \nwere delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) does not apply because \nApplicant has demonstrated a belated willingness to satisfy the past-due loans. AG \u00b6 \n19(f) applies because the missing Federal and state tax returns had not been filed when \nthe SOR was issued in November 2022. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s lack of documented action on the student loans between June 2017 \nand January 2023 continues to cast residual doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant merits no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) because the conditions leading \nto the difficulties were not beyond her control. She has been consistently employed \nsince July 2014. Her inability to begin repaying the student loans because her earnings \nwere insufficient, is a problem that she shares with most underemployed individuals in \nthis country. Her financial problems were not caused by a medical emergency or some \nother unanticipated event. Her inability to repay the student loans because she was \nproviding financial support to her mother, while a noble gesture, was a decision totally \nwithin her control. Her choice of providing financial help to her mother, when she had \nstudent loan problems to address, and of purchasing an expensive car rather than a \nless expensive car, precludes the application of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) presents mitigation where an applicant has had financial \ncounseling, and there are encouraging signs that her financial problems are being \nresolved or under control. Those signs are apparent through the aunt\u2019s productive \nfinancial counseling leading to Applicant\u2019s formation of a budget. Her aunt is teaching \nApplicant to seek assistance from appropriate individuals who have expertise in \nfinancial matters. In light of the aunt\u2019s financial counseling, Applicant is achieving control \nover the delinquent student loans. She has placed her student loans in a repayment \nplan under the Fresh Start program and has made five monthly repayments under the \nplan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable to circumstances of this case. The \ndocumentation that she has provided concerning the missing Federal and state tax \nreturns shows complete compliance with those repayment conditions. AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns related to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nThe disqualifying and mitigating conditions relevant to the circumstances of this \ncase are: \nAG \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \nIt is clear from the record that Applicant concealed information about her \nstudent loans from her October 2021 security clearance application. Notwithstanding \nthe confusing nature of some of her explanations, and the poor advice she received \nbefore answering the e-QIP questions, based on all her testimonial statements \nconcerning the falsification, I conclude that she deliberately concealed the student loan \ninformation from the October 2021 e-QIP (AG \u00b6 16(a), but she sufficiently mitigated the \nserious omission with her honest admission two months later in the October 2021 PSI. \n(AG \u00b6 17(a)) By indicating in her testimony that she would not repeat this conduct in the \nfuture, and receiving ongoing financial counseling from her aunt, I am satisfied that her \ninappropriate behavior with not happen again. (AG \u00b6 17(d)) \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that to \nestablish his case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed \nin the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that she has a plan for debt resolution and \nhas taken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant has a plan in place \nand has furnished documented evidence in furtherance of the plan to pay the delinquent \nstudent loans agencies listed in the SOR. \nTo prevent the SOR-events from recurring in the future, Applicant must use her \nbudget regularly. The budget is essential to maintaining accountability over her earnings \nand expenditures. If changes are made in her earnings or expenditures for any reason, \nshe must make appropriate changes in her budget. If she is spending too much, then \nshe should look for ways to reduce or cut back on her spending. She should rely on \ncash to reduce the urge to spend more than necessary. She should always have an \nopen mind to receive extra financial help in addition to the assistance of her aunt. She \nshould be ready to seek help from the facility security officer (FSO) or human relations \nofficer of her employer concerning any financial issue that confronts her. After a full \nreview of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of view, Applicant\u2019s \nongoing financial problems have been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSubparagraph 2.a:    \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, \nApplicant has mitigated the guidelines for financial considerations and personal \nconduct.

On March 1, 2024, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing \nwas scheduled to be conducted in person on April 4, 2024.

She \nnow seeks eligibility for a Top Secret clearance. (Tr. 42.) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from about \nJune 2020 to about August 2021 on approximately five occasions after being granted \naccess to classified information. (SOR \u00b6 1.) She admitted the allegation. (Answer.) \nApplicant completed her first SCA on October 31, 2016. (GE 3.) GE 3, page 27, \nasked about illegal use of drugs. She responded in the negative. She completed her \nsecond SCA on November 15, 2019. (GE 2.) GE 2, page 16, asked about illegal use of \ndrugs. She responded in the negative. She completed her most recent SCA on \nSeptember 7, 2021. (GE 1.) GE 1, pages 35-37, asked about illegal use of drugs. She \nresponded that: \u201cTried it once when legalized in [Jurisdiction # 1]. When [Jurisdiction # 2] \nlegalized it, I consumed it 4x.\u201d She gave the first use as in June 2020 and her second use \nas in August 2021. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified first about her family life. Her family is her mother \nand a younger brother who is 27 years old. Her father died of cancer when she was 21 \nand a junior in college. Her mother works for a minimum wage. She knew right away that \nshe was the breadwinner and would have to go to work as soon as she graduated. As \nthe head of the household, she managed her family finances. Her father left a rental \nproperty that she also managed. Upon graduation, he job opportunities were limited. \nThere were many \u201ctech jobs and government contracting\u201d jobs but \u201cnothing of chemical \nengineering of the sorts.\u201d A neighbor referred her to the neighbor\u2019s company, and \u201cthat\u2019s \nhow [she] got into [her] career as an IT Project Management Professional.\u201d (Tr. 19.) \nApplicant testified about her overall orientation in DOD personnel security \nprograms. She did not really receive any training on her clearance program at all: \u201cIt was \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njust fill out the forms, and that was it, and wait for the process to begin. It was mostly to \nensure that you\u2019re a U.S. citizen, that you don\u2019t have foreign contacts that can make me \nlook like a spy, or any financial problems, and never covered any personal conduct such \nas marijuana use.\u201d (Tr. 20-21.) \nApplicant testified about her first use of marijuana, in June 2020. She was at a \nfriend\u2019s party in U.S. Jurisdiction #1, where marijuana was legal. She met acquaintances \nwho were using marijuana. She was ignorant about \u201cthe fact that marijuana is federally \nillegal.\u201d \u201cSo, in that environment, we\u2019re all trying to have a good time. So I was being \nagreeable and pressured socially to use marijuana.\u201d (Tr. 21.) Her second use of marijuana \nwas also at a party, in August 2021 in U.S. Jurisdiction #2, where marijuana was legal. \nShe \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was harmful . . . so that\u2019s how those incidents happen.\u201d (Tr. 21-22.) \nApplicant testified about how she learned that marijuana was federally illegal. \nWhile applying for her current clearance [September 2021], her company facility security \nofficer (FSO) \u201chelped review [her] application before submission . . . and educated [her] \nabout marijuana use as a contractor.\u201d That was when she learned that marijuana use was \nfederally illegal. Her first application was in 2016. (Tr.22-24.) \n Applicant first got a clearance in 2016 at a previous company that was very small \nwith less than ten employees. \u201c[I] was probably the first young employee going through \ntheir first clearance, so maybe they didn\u2019t mention to me . . . you shouldn\u2019t be doing \nmarijuana.\u201d Now she is working for a different company that: \u201c[H]ad more experience as \nan FSO. That is their only role. So they did a better job educating me about what to do \u2013 \nand what not to do when I have a clearance or going through for a clearance.\u201d (Tr. 25-\n26.)   \nApplicant testified how her life has changed since 2021. She was younger then, \nliving with her family, liked to go out more often, and hang out with friends. But she bought \na townhouse with her current significant other and does not really hang out with people \noutside of work and a small group of friends. She avoids people and environments where \ndrug misuse could happen. She no longer associates with acquaintances who use \nmarijuana. Her current friends do not use or get involved with marijuana or any type of \ndrugs. Her cohabitant and friends are aware of her work and clearance situation. (Tr. 26-\n28.)  \nApplicant testified that she understood her Statement of Intent not to use: Any \nfuture drug misuse would make her ineligible for a clearance, and a current clearance \ncould be revoked. (Tr. 28.) AE H is Applicant\u2019s Statement of Intent Not To Abuse Any \nDrugs dated March 31, 2024. AE C is a Declaration of Applicant dated March 21, 2024, \nthat describes a Statement of Intent she signed on October 5, 2022. That Statement is \nattached as part of GE 4. \nApplicant testified about why she wants to maintain her eligibility for access to \nclassified information with Government. She answered that she has worked for three \ndifferent Government agencies, military, civilian, and intelligence. She takes pride in and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nvalues her work and her contributions to this country.

(Tr. 29-30.) \nApplicant testified about her SCA in October 2016, which was for a Secret \nclearance. This was her very first SCA. It was very long, and she made sure she filled it \nout thoroughly. She recalled the questions about drug use. She did not know how many, \nbut there were \u201ca lot.\u201d She agreed that use of drugs was not compatible with a clearance. \n(Tr. 31-32.) \nApplicant testified about her first job. She did not have to do any screening like a \ndrug test. Her employer did not have a drug policy that she was aware of. (Tr. 32-33.) \nApplicant confirmed that her first use of marijuana was in Jurisdiction #1. She did \nnot recall when she first learned that marijuana was legal in Jurisdiction #1; she just knew \nit was. It did not occur to her at all to inquire whether it was legal in Jurisdiction #1 and \nwas permissible for her to use it as a clearance holder. She is not a legal expert and \nassumed that if it was legal in Jurisdiction # 1, it was legal anywhere in Jurisdiction # 1. \nShe was 25 when she first used marijuana. (Tr.33-34.) \nApplicant testified about her first employment position. She was asked whether \nshe received any sort of training on having a clearance. She answered \u201cNot at all.\u201d She \nworked there from 2016 to 2021, and no one ever sent her emails or communications \nsaying \u201ceven though it\u2019s legal in [Jurisdiction $1] it\u2019s not legal for you.\u201d (Tr. 34.) \nApplicant testified about the two incidents where she used marijuana. The \nmarijuana was there at a party. Someone brought it in. Those present were \nacquaintances of mutual friends, not friends of hers. They just offered it to her, and she \n\u201cdidn\u2019t think twice about it.\u201d At the time, she was not worried that the marijuana could have \nbeen laced with something. (Tr. 35.) \nApplicant testified that the people she now socializes with do not use marijuana to \nher knowledge. Her cohabitant does not use marijuana. She\u2019s worked for her current \nemployer for two years and nine months. It does not have any sort of drug testing as part \nof the onboarding process. It does not have any sort of drug free workplace policy that \nshe is aware of. (Tr 35-36.) \nApplicant testified about the materials she works with in her current position. The \nmaterials she works with are stamped with FOUO [For Official Use Only]. She does not \nnow work with any Secret or classified information.

This was her first time with a \ncounselor or a therapist. She found Ms. Bravo online and then contacted a local clinic \nwhich referred her to Ms. Bravo, who specialized in substance abuse. Ms. Bravo saw \nmany patients with cases like hers, those who worked for the federal Government and \nexperienced problems like hers. Ms. Bravo looked to be in her 30s or 40s and had \nperhaps at least 10 years of experience with a wide range of expertise. (Tr. 38-39.) \nApplicant scheduled an assessment with Ms. Bravo. They met in Ms. Bravo\u2019s office \nfor about a half an hour. (Tr. 38-39.) Ms. Bravo educated her about substance abuse, not \nlimited to marijuana but alcohol as well. She was also educated about mental health. Ms. \nBravo conducted an assessment of her mental well-being and whether or not she had a \nsubstance abuse disorder. Ms. Bravo stated in her assessment that she did not have a \nmental health disorder nor a substance abuse disorder. (Tr. 29.) \nMs. Bravo\u2019s Assessment reached the following conclusions: \n After my evaluation and discussion with Applicant, it is to the best of \nmy knowledge that the circumstances which contributed to her previous \nmarijuana use were related to recreational  use and not a substance abuse \ndisorder . . . Additionally, Applicant shared that she has a positive support \nsystem and exhibits a strong ability to navigate challenges that present \nthemselves. She currently does not meet the criteria for any DSM-V \ndiagnoses; therefore, my recommendation is for Applicant to continue with \nthe pursuit of her career goals.1  (AE G.)  \nApplicant submitted five Declarations of Support as character references. (AE D.) \nThe Declarants have known her from as far back as 2006 and as currently as 2022. They \nhave known her on personal, professional, and educational levels, and in some cases in \nmore than one of those environments. They uniformly attest to her as being responsible, \nreliable, trustworthy, with integrity and sound judgment. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nAnalysis \nUnder AG H, illegal drug use may raise questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24 sets forth the concern, \nas follows:  \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled\nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802.\nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe potentially applicable mitigating conditions here are quoted below: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse\nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and possession of it is regulated by \nthe federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. \nThe knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and \npunishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal or recreational marijuana use) remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nApplicant admitted in her most recent SCA that she used marijuana once at a \nsocial gathering in June 2020 and four times at a social gathering in August 2021. She \nalso admitted in her Answer the sole SOR allegation, including that her usage was \u201cafter \nbeing granted access to classified information.\u201d And at hearing, she testified that during \nprevious employments she worked with Secret and Confidential materials. Therefore, AG \n\u00b6 25(a) applies. The question is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a). In Applicant\u2019s prior defense \ncontractor employments, she did not receive much training on the DOD security clearance \nprograms. They focused on U.S. citizenship, foreign contacts, and financial problems. \nMarijuana use was never covered at all. It was with that lack of information that she used \nmarijuana in the first instance in June 2020 in a jurisdiction where marijuana was legal. It \nwas a social gathering, and she was offered the marijuana by an acquaintance of a mutual \nfriend. At that time, she did not know that marijuana was federally illegal. It was a similar \ncircumstance in August 2021, when she used marijuana a second time, at a social \ngathering in a jurisdiction where marijuana was also legaI. \nIn fact, she first learned that marijuana was federally illegal only when her current \nFSO reviewed her most recent SCA (September 2021). As expected from a trained \nchemical engineer, she quantified her first use as \u201donce\u201d and her second use as \u201c4x.\u201d She \nis not a serial drug user and has no history of any prior illegal drug use. The record shows, \nher marijuana use was minimal and infrequent, is highly unlikely to recur, and does not \ncast doubt on her suitability for a national security clearance. Her marijuana use is \nmitigated by AG \u00b6 26(a). \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant has satisfied the \nthreshold requirement. She acknowledged her drug use in her SCA, in her Answer, \nand in her testimony during the hearing. She also testified that she no longer \nassociates with drug using individuals. Applicant testified that the people she now \nsocializes with do not use marijuana to her knowledge. Her cohabitant does not use \nmarijuana. She submitted two signed statements that comport with AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). Her \nmarijuana use is mitigated by AG \u00b6 26(b). \nThe SOR did not plead that Applicant engaged in \u201cillegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, AG \u00b6 26(f) does not \napply. In any event, in ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022), the Appeal \nBoard held that access to classified information has two elements in addition to eligibility. \nThey are that: (1) an applicant must have signed a nondisclosure agreement (NDA); and \n(2) an applicant must have a need-to-know (NTK). Here, she has signed an NDA and has \ntaken NTK training, but she is not allowed to work with classified information. She works \nonly with CUI, because she lacks the necessary security clearance. Nor can she enter \nher employer\u2019s secure facility, because she lacks the required clearance. She does not \ncurrently have access to classified information.  Thus, the record would not support an \nAG \u00b6 26(f) allegation.                     \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 84) \nAlthough he did not experience a lengthy unemployment, he worked for a contractor that \npaid him annual income that was almost two-thirds less than he earned from his previous \nemployer.

(Tr. 87) \nConsequently, Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent. Most significantly, he was \nbehind on his $78,000 student loan for which he had used to attend flight school. (Tr. 82) \nShortly after getting his current job and relocating, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nHe found that even with the new job, he was struggling to stay caught up on his debts.

(Tr. 97) \nSOR subparagraph 2.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana between June 2009 \nand January 2017. Although Applicant indicated that he used marijuana during this time \nframe on his 2018 security clearance application, he denied the corresponding SOR \nallegation. (GE 1 at 33; Answer at 5-6) Instead, he testified that he used marijuana \nbeginning in high school in 2000 and stopped in 2008 and was attempting to disclose this \nuse - which he had failed to disclose earlier on a 2008 security clearance application \u2013 \nwhen he provided the wrong dates on the most recent application. (Tr. 100-101) In addition, \nhe acknowledged that his 2018 security clearance application responses \u201ccaused \nunnecessary confusion and concern for the Government.\u201d (Answer at 6) \nApplicant contends that he did not disclose his marijuana use between 2000 and \n2008 on his security application in 2008 because the company\u2019s facility security officer at \nhis then-job told him that he did not have to disclose it if he had no intention of using it \nagain. (Tr. 103-104) After talking to other facility security officers over the years, Applicant \ncame to understand that he should have disclosed his early 2000s marijuana use on his \n2008 security clearance application. (Tr. 109) Applicant contends that when he \u201ccame \nclean\u201d about his marijuana use on his 2018 security clearance application, he meant to \nindicate that the use occurred from roughly 2000 to 2008, not 2009 to 2017, as he \ninadvertently indicated. (Tr. 102) \nApplicant used marijuana in cigarette form. He used it to help him sleep. He stopped \nusing it because it made him feel anxious instead of tired.

(Tr. 77-78, 90) He has no good explanation as to why he \n\u201cstupidly answered in the affirmative [on the 2018 security clearance application] when the \ntruthful answer was negative.\u201d (Answer at 6) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a) \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2014 after his then-employer went out of business. \nAlthough Applicant was never unemployed, he earned less than one-third of what he had \nearned previously. In 2016, Applicant initiated an effort to resolve his debts by filing for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2016. As part of the bankruptcy process, Applicant \nreceived financial counseling. \nIn 2018, the court discharged Applicant\u2019s debts, including the student loan debt, \nalleged in the SOR. Currently, Applicant earns $126,000 annually, more than double what \nhe earned before he developed financial problems. (Tr. 97) The only recurring debt he has \nis a car loan with a balance of less than $2,000. I conclude that the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 apply; \n: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn sum, Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nUnder this guideline, \u2018the illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse \nof prescription and non-prescription drugs and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  \n                                                                                                                                                 \n                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \npurposes. (AG \u00b6 24) Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \n\u201cany substance misuse.\u201d \nAs the Appeal Board noted, \u201celigibility for access to classified information and the \ngranting of access to classified information are not synonymous concepts; [rather] they are \nseparate concepts.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. August 10, 2022)) Although \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana coincided with a time-period when he held a security \nclearance, there is no record evidence that he possessed access to classified information, \nas alleged in subparagraph 2.b. Consequently, I resolve subparagraph 2.b in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he did not use marijuana between 2009 and 2017 despite \nindicating this on his security clearance application is not credible. As such, it undercuts the \nprobative value of his contention that his marijuana use will not recur in the future. I have \nnot considered his false statement at his hearing for disqualification purposes. Rather, I \nhave considered his false statement in my mitigation and whole-person analysis. I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant admitted to falsifying his 2008 security clearance \napplication by not disclosing marijuana use. Consequently, AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nApplicant disclosed the falsification before being confronted by an investigative \nagent about it. However, he disclosed the falsification approximately ten years after he \ncompleted the security clearance application. AG \u00b617(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, \ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts,\u201d is only partially applicable. Regardless of when Applicant \nreported the misconduct, it constitutes a \u201cpositive step to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation or duress.\u201d (AG \u00b6 17(e)) I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcern generated by his falsification of the 2008 security clearance application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant is a good worker who is well-respected by his superiors and his \ncolleagues. However, his testimony that he mistakenly indicated the wrong dates of \nmarijuana use on his 2018 security clearance application was not credible. Consequently, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 19, 2023, and requested a hearing. This \ncase was assigned to me on October 24, 2023. A hearing was scheduled for January \n24, 2024, and was heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and no \nexhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 2, 2024. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 14 delinquent debts \nexceeding $24,000. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved and \noutstanding. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) falsified her electronic questionnaires \nof investigations processing (e-QIPs) of December 31, 2021 and February 11, 2018, \nrespectively, by omitting her delinquent debts covered by Guideline F, supra; (b) was \nsuspended by her Government employer for 14 days in June 2021 due to multiple \ncomplaints about her behavior from supervisors, co-workers, and passengers; (c) is not \neligible for rehire from a previous employer where she worked from 2014 until 2018 due \nto allegations that she used her company credit card for personal purchases; (d) was \narrested and charged in June 2012 with coupon fraud over the course of her \nemployment with a previous employer; and (e) was arrested and charged in February \n2008 with theft that occurred during her employment with another employer. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, she denied most of the allegations covered \nby Guideline F with explanations. She claimed she paid off several of the debts and \ncould not identify the others covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.g-1.h, 1.j-1.k and 1.m. \nFor the debts she admitted (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.n) she claimed she was \nlooking into them and would be making arrangements to pay them. She further claimed \nthat she is making more money now and is very dependable and dedicated to her job. \nAddressing the allegations covered by Guideline E, Applicant denied falsifying \nthe e-QIPS she completed in 2018 and 2021, respectively. She claimed she has never \nhad a repossession or foreclosure and was never evicted or garnished. \nAdmitting her June 2021 suspension, she claimed she accepted her suspension \nand found other employment. She claimed she was never charged or confronted with \nusing her company credit card for personal purchases while employed for another \nemployer between 2014 and 2018. She further claimed that she was found not guilty of \n(a) charged coupon fraud in June 2012 while employed by another employer and (b) \ntheft while employed by a different employer in February 2008. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated \nand adopted as relevant and material findings.

(GEs 1-2; Tr. 22) Only her middle child (who attends college) resides \nwith her. (Tr. 23). She earned a diploma in travel and tourism in February 2000, an \nassociate\u2019s degree in February 2002, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2005. (GEs \n1-2) Applicant reported no military service. \nSince November 2021, Applicant has been employed as a security officer for her \ncurrent employer. (GEs 1-2) She reported unemployment between September 2021 and \nNovember 2021 and between February and March 2018. (GEs 1 and 3). Between \nMarch 2018 and September 2021, she worked for a federal agency as a security officer. \nShe held various jobs with other employers between April 1999 and February 2018. \nApplicant held a security clearance with the federal agency she worked for between \nMarch 2018 and September 2021. (GEs 1; Tr. 23, 27) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nBetween 2013 and 2020, Applicant accumulated 14 delinquent accounts \nexceeding $24,000. (GEs 3-4 and 6-8) To date, Applicant has provided no \ndocumentation of addressing any of the listed SOR debts. One of the listed SOR debts \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) covers a delinquency balance on a vehicle she purchased in 2016 for \n$10,712. (GEs 3 and 6-8) While the loan has since been charged off, Applicant retains \npossession of the vehicle with no plans to pay off the debt. (GEs 68; Tr. 28-30) \nAnother debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) covered a telecommunications account opened in \n2017 and placed for collection in 2021. (GEs 6-7) Applicant claimed that her cell phone \ncovered by the account was stolen and reported to the police and SOR 1.c creditor. (Tr. \n71-74) Told by the creditor that she did not need to worry about the account, she never \nfollowed up with the creditor or addressed the debt. (Tr. 74) Without any documentation \ncovering her conversations with the creditor, her claims of forgiveness by SOR creditor \n1.c cannot be accepted as sufficient to resolve the debt. \nOther debts covered by the SOR remain unresolved and outstanding. While \nApplicant claims to have paid off two of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.k), lacked awareness of \nothers (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.h and 1.m), and committed to look into the remaining ones (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, 1.k-1.l, and 1.n), she provided no documentation of any efforts to track down \nthese debts and either validate and resolve them or dispute them with documented \nevidence. Other debts that she acknowledged as her own, she furnished no \ndocumentation of any initiatives on her part to contact her creditors and either work out \npayment arrangements or explain why she could not reach any positive settlements with \nthe creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP and PSI omissions \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in December 2021, Applicant omitted material facts \nrelated to her delinquent debts she accumulated between 2013 and 2020.

See Applicant\u2019s SOR response and hearing testimony. \nIn a follow-up personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator from the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2022, Applicant was asked during the \ncourse of her interview whether she has any delinquent accounts, and she initially \nconfirmed the correctness of all of the information about her finances that she provided \nin her 2021 E-QIP. (GE 3) After being afforded the opportunity to provide voluntary \ninformation about her finances, she was confronted by the investigator about each of \nthe debts listed in the SOR. (GE 3) Once confronted, Applicant admitted the debts and \nprovided explanations about the debts and what steps she intended to take to address \nthem, (GE 3) \nConsidered together, and taking account of her explanations and all of the \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accruals and ensuing denials over the \ncourse of many years, Applicant\u2019s withholding of material information about the details \nof her accumulated debts in her 2021 e-QIP and ensuing PSI, inferences are warranted \nthat her material omissions were the result of candor and judgment lapses that were \ncorrected only after confrontation by her interviewing OPM investigator in her January \n2022 PSI. \nOther incidents covered in the SOR reflect acts of dishonesty on Applicant\u2019s part \nthat when stitched together form a pattern of dishonest conduct over a period of many \nyears (even without convictions). Each of these incidents were covered in Applicant\u2019s \n2022 PSI. Confronted by the OPM investigator in her 2022 PSI with a reported incident \nin February 2008, in which she was reportedly arrested and charged with theft that \noccurred during her employment at a previously listed employer, Applicant \nacknowledged the incident, while defending her actions, and claimed she was subjected \nto a deferred judgment (not a conviction), placed on two years of probation, and \nultimately discharged from the deferred judgment. (GE 3) Similarly, when confronted by \nthe OPM agent with a reported 2013 incident, in which she was charged with coupon \nfraud while employed by another listed employer, Applicant acknowledged her charged \nactions, her ensuing Alford plea, and her acceptance of the court\u2019s imposed probation \nand fine. (GEs 3 and 5; Tr. 64-67)) \nIn addition to the raised 2008 and 2013 theft and fraud incidents, Applicant was \nasked in her 2022 PSI about employer allegations of a 14-day suspension from her \nemployment with a government employer in June 2021 over multiple complaints about \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher behavior from supervisors, co-workers, and passengers.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . . AG \u00b6 18. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack f candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest a \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative and adjudicative processes. . . AG \u00b6 15. \n Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s \nmaterial omissions of her delinquent debts in the e-QIP she completed in 2021 and \nadditional reported incidents involving lapses in candor and judgment. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s. accumulation of delinquent debts warrant the application of two \ndisqualifying conditions (DCs).

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position.

Sept. 26, 2019) \nPersonal Conduct Concerns \nAdditional security concerns arise over Applicant\u2019s arrest and disciplinary history \nand failure to disclose relevant material information to an OPM investigator when asked \nto so.

(GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 8, 34-36.) \nApplicant used marijuana or THC edibles on four occasions, and possibly on a fifth \noccasion that he disclosed because he was unsure whether active THC was involved. \nThe first three times involved experimental smoking of marijuana in 1998 and 2002 while \nhe was in, respectively, high school and college, and sharing a friend\u2019s THC vaporizer \none time in 2012. During 2018, Applicant ate a THC-laced edible candy product that was \noffered to him by a state-licensed marijuana retailer who was a casual friend that he last \nsaw more than four years ago. The fourth incident occurred in 2020 when he accepted a \nhemp-laced edible product from the wife a friend in a social setting, which he reported \nbecause he suspected that it might have contained active THC. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 30-37, \n48-49.) \nApplicant testified, and has consistently reported, that he did not enjoy any of these \nexperiences and has no intention to use marijuana-related products again. His wife does \nnot use drugs and, as he testified, \u201cwas aware of the last one. It was an issue at the time.\u201d \n(Answer; GE 1; AE A; Tr. 44-46, 49.) \nApplicant credibly testified that he understood his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace \npolicies to cover only use of, or impairment from, substance misuse while at work. He \nwas not in a safety-related position subject to random drug testing. He was aware that \nmarijuana remains a controlled substance under Federal law, despite its legalization for \nsale and use in his state of residence. He did not consider his minor social \nexperimentation with the edible products, after he was granted a security clearance, to \nconstitute any risk to his national security responsibilities. He now understands that it cast \npotential doubt on his willingness to comply with Federal laws and regulations and will not \nrepeat that conduct. He submitted an electronically signed written statement declaring his \nintent to refrain from substance misuse and his disassociation from all local state-licensed \ncannabis retailers, and acknowledging that further use is grounds for revocation of any \nnational security eligibility.

(AE B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the SEAD 4 adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying based on the SOR allegations in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admittedly used marijuana or a THC-laced edible or vaporizer on four \noccasions in 1998, 2002, 2012, and 2018. He also accepted a hemp-laced edible from a \nfriend\u2019s wife during 2020 which may have contained Federally regulated levels of THC. \nHe was granted a security clearance and was granted access to classified information in \n2017. He knew that his marijuana experimentation was illegal under Federal law but did \nnot believe that it violated his company\u2019s employee substance abuse policies or \ncompromised his national security responsibilities. This establishes security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f). Accordingly, the burden to mitigate the established concerns \nshifts to Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides two conditions that could mitigate the drug-related security \nconcerns raised in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021. \nIn her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have legalized or \ndecriminalized the use of marijuana. She reaffirmed the 2014 SecEA memorandum \nregarding the importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of \nmarijuana by holders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal \nmarijuana policy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance \nadjudications, \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines \nprovided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns \nraised by his or her past use of marijuana. \nApplicant fully mitigated the security concerns raised by his infrequent marijuana \nexperimentation on four or five occasions from about 1998 through 2020. He neither \nenjoyed THC use nor engaged in any repeated patterns of such conduct. He knew that \nhis drug involvement was illegal under Federal law but reasonably did not believe that it \nwas contrary to his employer\u2019s safety and security policies. He credibly testified and \nsubmitted written declarations of intent not to misuse drugs in the future, and \nacknowledged that such misuse would be grounds for revocation of his national security \neligibility. He no longer associates with people involved in substance misuse. \nThis evidence establishes that drug abuse is unlikely to recur, and his freely \nadmitted isolated incidents many years ago cast no doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Accordingly, the Guideline H security concerns are \ncompletely mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26 (b).

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s four or five isolated \nincidents of experimenting with THC over the past 26 years leave me without significant \ndoubts as to his eligibility for a security clearance. He established both his integrity and \nhis intention to remain abstinent to the maximum extent possible; thereby minimizing the \npotential for exploitation or duress, and the likelihood of recurrence. He is a mature and \nhighly regarded professional with an excellent record of responsible performance in the \ndefense industry. He demonstrated his trustworthiness, responsibility, and willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress is \ninsignificant. Applicant fully met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nthe Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.

(GE 4 at 4; Tr. at 72) \nThe SOR alleged eight financial concerns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.h) totaling about \n$117,000 in delinquent debts. Amongst the eight allegations are two delinquent student \nloans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) totaling about $63,718, or 54% of the total alleged delinquent \ndebts. \nThe evidence regarding financial issues alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($38,297) and 1.b ($25,421): Applicant admitted being delinquent on \nhis two U.S. Department of Education (DOE) student loans. In his SOR response, he \nstated he applied for student loan forgiveness in an effort to resolve these loans. Both \nstudent loans were placed for collection and assigned to the government as indicated in \nhis April 2022 credit bureau report (CBR). (GE 2 at 2) \nApplicant testified he took out these student loans between 2002 and 2004. He \nstated he initially paid either $109 or $120 per month, and that he stopped making \npayments in about 2005. He stated he restarted payments of either $250 or $344, but he \ncould not remember when. (Tr. 34-35) He again stopped making payments at an unknown \ntime and testified he had not made any full payments since 2018 or 2019, before the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. at 35). At some point he began making payments on a student \nloan rehabilitation program. He stated he then applied for student loan forgiveness by \nsending a short email to the DOE. He received a letter from DOE in either 2021 or 2022 \nindicating his student loans were paused under President Biden\u2019s program. (Tr. 36-38) At \nthe hearing, Applicant presented a letter from DOE dated August 16, 2023, which notified \nhim that the student loan repayment pause or deferment was ending and that student \nloan payments would resume in September 2023. He did not provide a copy of the letter \nat the hearing. (Tr. at 37) I left the record open for a week to allow Applicant to submit a \ncopy of the August 16, 2023 letter and any additional documentary evidence, especially \nconcerning his student loans. He did not submit any documentary evidence on his student \nloans during this period; nor did he submit a record copy of the August 16, 2023 letter \nreferenced above. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($18,269): \nApplicant admitted this delinquent debt. In his SOR \nresponse and at the hearing, Applicant stated he contacted the creditor many times but \nthe creditor would not accept payments, but would accept a settlement of the delinquent \ndebt. This individual account was opened in October 2014, and the last payment made \non it occurred in October 2018. (GE 3 at 4; Tr. 39-42). The debt was assigned to a \ncollection agent in December 2019, and ultimately charged off for the full $18,269. (GE 3 \nat 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($804): Applicant admitted this debt.

This individual \naccount is being collected by a third-party. Applicant stated this was for a claim against \nhim by the person causing a rental car accident. The debt was originally assigned in \nJanuary 2018.

He opened \nthis individual account in March 2020. In April 2022, the creditor reported a 120-day \ndelinquency with a past-due balance of $2,700. (GE 2 at 4) Applicant testified he offered \nto make a payment, but the creditor refused to accept it. The creditor demanded the full \nbalance of the account. (Tr. 57-60) Applicant testified the car is still in his possession, and \nthat the creditor never repossessed it though he provided the creditor with the location of \nthe car. The last payment he made occurred in May 2022. (Tr. 57-60) The creditor \nultimately charged off this delinquent debt for $29,856 as reported in Applicant\u2019s August \n2023 credit bureau report.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has a long history of financial problems. \nHis current delinquent debts are numerous and ongoing. Most remain unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant has been gainfully employed since at least \n2009, and he has also occasionally worked a second part-time position over this period. \nHe earns a six-figure annual salary. There is no indication he acted responsibly by taking \nmeaningful steps to substantively address his delinquent debts. He is credited with \naddressing two smaller delinquent accounts, but this action alone is insufficient to \nestablish mitigation. Although his student loans are no longer in a collection or default \nstatus, it is because of a special Presidential action. Applicant is credited with taking the \ninitiative to apply for the President\u2019s program, but mitigation requires looking back to \nevaluate an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on a record of historical actions. \nApplicant has a sporadic and inconsistent history of repaying his student loans. He \nstopped making payments on his student loans on several occasions for reasons not \nunderstood. The current status of his student loans does not excuse his past inaction \nwhen evaluating his security clearance worthiness. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 \n(App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant testified he had informal discussions about \nfinancial matters with unknown acquaintances. This is insufficient to establish he is \nreceiving financial counseling for his problems from a legitimate and credible source. His \nfinancial problems are not at all under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant is credited with taking minimal action \nto begin addressing two of the smaller delinquent debts. However, he has multiple \ndelinquent debts that he has not acted on, without a plan in place. He has not established \na repayment plan to address his longstanding delinquent debts, especially with higher \nbalances. \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with some comments, all factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.iii.). Her admissions are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant was a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she has served as a tool assistant since 2021. She had also been serving as a security officer for another contractor (on different shifts) since early 2018 but it appears that she has not worked for it for some unspecified time.

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 16, 2022, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaires for Investigative Processing (e-QIP). On March 10, 2022, \nshe was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). On November 16, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to her under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department \nof Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) and detailed reasons why the DCSA \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a \ncontract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn December 8, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on January 18, 2023. The case was assigned to me on August 29, \n2023. A Notice of Microsoft Teams Video Teleconference Hearing was issued on June \n26, 2024. I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 24, 2024. \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw the \nallegation pertaining to personal conduct. There being no objection, the motion was \ngranted. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 5, 2024. I kept \nthe record open until the close of business on August 2, 2024, to enable Applicant to \nsupplement it with documentation that was identified during the hearing. She took \nadvantage of that opportunity and submitted several documents that were marked and \nadmitted into evidence as Applicant exhibits (AE) A through AE I without objection. The \nrecord closed on August 2, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with some comments, all factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.iii.). Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings \nof fact: \nBackground \nApplicant was a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she has served \nas a tool assistant since 2021. She had also been serving as a security officer for another \ncontractor (on different shifts) since early 2018 but it appears that she has not worked for \nit for some unspecified time. She previously worked for other employers as a security \nsupervisor (August 2002 until August 2012), and in security (August 2012 until March \n2017). She was unemployed from March 2017 until early January 2018. She is a 1992 \nhigh school graduate. She has never been granted a secret clearance. She has never \nserved in the U.S. military. She was married in 1998 and divorced in 2000. She has one \nchild, born in 2009. \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: GE 2 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated March \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10, 2022); GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated \nFebruary 23, 2022); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 18, 2023); GE 5 \n(Experian Credit Report, dated July 16, 2024); and AE D (Personal Financial Statement, \ndated July 30, 2024). \nThe SOR alleged 61 delinquent accounts, of which 60 of them are medical \naccounts that were placed for collection, totaling approximately $52,891. One of the \nindividual accounts has an unpaid balance as high as $2,384, and another has an unpaid \nbalance as low as $74. (GE 3 at 2-20) \nAccording to Applicant, her child\u2019s father does not provide any financial support \n(Tr. at 19). Her financial issues started when she lost her job March 2017 and was unable \nto pay her mortgage. She had purchased the residence for $50,000 in 2010, and her \nmonthly mortgage payments were $597. (Tr. at 29) The bank attempted to foreclose on \nthe property, but Applicant was able to resolve the issue and the foreclosure was \ndismissed. (GE 2 at 5) She has made timely monthly payments since at least December \n2020. (GE 4 at 8) In 2018, Applicant did not have health insurance because the \ndeductibles were too high, and the coverage was not good, so she opted out of it. She \ngot better health insurance in 2019. (Tr. at 20-21) \nA series of events occurred over which Applicant had no control: \n\u25cfin 2017, her automobile was rearended and totaled, and she had to purchase a \nnew vehicle, with only a portion of her expenses covered. (Tr. at 23);  \n\u25cfthe collision also caused her medical expenses with chiropractors and regular \ndoctors, but only a portion of those medical expenses were covered. (Tr. at 22-23);  \n\u25cfthe collision was resolved with the assistance of an attorney, but the attorney\u2019s \nservices cost her about one-third of her $20,000 award (Tr. at 24), and she cannot verify \nthat fact because the attorney has since passed away and she cannot find any paperwork. \n(AE C);  \n\u25cfin November 2019 she had emergency gallbladder surgery, but her health \ninsurance did not cover many of the surgery-related expenses. (GE 2 at 8);  \n\u25cfin late June 2023, she was diagnosed with acute chest pain that was \u201chighly \nindicative of myocardial injury\u201d and underwent a double coronary artery bypass surgery \n(CABG-2). She was released to homecare in early July 2023, and underwent cardiac \nrehabilitation. (Tr. at 19; AE F at 5; AE G at 2, 14-15; AE H at 5; AE I at 2, 14); \n\u25cfin July 2024, she underwent an angioplasty and stenting and had a cardiac stent \nplacement in a cardiac artery and underwent cardiac rehabilitation. (Tr. at 12) \nIn addition to all the above, Applicant has been diagnosed by her hospital \nphysicians with the following conditions: type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia, \natherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris, \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npneumonia, acute respiratory failure with hypoxia, atelectasis, other pneumothorax, \nessential (primary) hypertension, scoliosis, sleep apnea, migraine, anxiety, and asthma. \n(AE I at 2-3) Because of her various medical conditions, Applicant has been prescribed \nover a dozen medications and medical devices. (AE I at 4-6) \nApplicant had every intention to address her outstanding accounts, but the various \nincidents and conditions interfered with her efforts, and she simply forgot because she \nwas worried about getting better for her daughter. As of the date of the hearing, she had \nnot resolved any of the accounts, but was hopeful of doing so. (Tr. at 12, 27, 30) When \nshe receives new medical bills, she routinely pays the medical provider the required co-\npay. (Tr. at 33) \nApplicant\u2019s Earning Statements for her hourly wages reflect a variety of gross and \nnet pay over each two-week period. Since April 1, 2024, she has worked between 40 and \n101 hours per each two-week period, and her net pay has been between $1,428.17 and \n$1,837.56. (AE E) She apparently did not understand the complexity of the Personal \nFinancial Statement, for as of July 30, 2024, she reported an inaccurate biweekly gross \nsalary but an accurate net salary for that period. She reported monthly expenses of \napproximately $1,000, and one monthly debt payment (her mortgage) of $594.97. \nAlthough she did not compute a monthly remainder, she would have had approximately \n$1,138 available for saving or spending. (AE D) During a two-month period between April \n2024 and June 2024, her checking account ending balances were between approximately \n$995 and $318. (AE A; AE B)   \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. DOD contractor personnel \nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. In this regard, it should be noted that a \nmemorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and \nSecurity, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, covers the \nhandling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in \nADP contractor cases for trustworthiness determinations.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided \ndrawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant failed to maintain 61 accounts, totaling approximately $52,891, in a \ncurrent status and they all became delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished, but there is no evidence that Applicant had been unwilling to satisfy her debts \nregardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply. Commencing in 2017, a series of events occurred \nover which Applicant had no control. They continued up until the week before the hearing \nin this matter. She was the innocent victim of a rear-end collision, totaling her vehicle and \ncausing her medical issues. She lost her employment and was unemployed for \napproximately ten months. She had poor health insurance with high deductibles or \nperiods without health insurance. She experienced numerous health issues and \nunexpected medical emergencies resulting in a CABG-2, gallbladder removal, and an \nangioplasty and stenting. She underwent rehabilitation. Added to those issues, the father \nof Applicant\u2019s child has not paid any child support. Despite all those issues, when \nconfronted with the probable foreclosure of her residence, Applicant managed to fight \nback and successfully managed to have that action dismissed. She has made timely \nmonthly payments since at least December 2020. She continues to obtain medical care \nbut now she always pays the required copay. Other than the delinquent medical accounts \nand the one non-medical account, all her present accounts are current. \nNevertheless, a debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered \nrecent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant acknowledged initially that she \nwas unable to keep those accounts current due to her unique circumstances but that she \nhad every intention of doing so when she was able to do so. However, the various \nincidents and conditions interfered with her efforts, and she simply forgot because she \nwas worried about getting better for her daughter.  \nSince April 1, 2024, she has worked between 40 and 101 hours per each two-week \nperiod, and her net pay has been between $1,428.17 and $1,837.56. Her monthly \nexpenses are approximately $1,000, in addition to one monthly mortgage payment of \n$594.97. She should have approximately $1,138 available for saving or spending. During \na two-month period between April 2024 and June 2024, her checking account ending \nbalances were between approximately $995 and $318. While that amount is not \noverwhelming, although she has continuing health issues, since most of her serious \nhealth issues are now behind her, she can start focusing on resolving her delinquent \ndebts. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant either ignored her delinquent \naccounts for a substantial period or simply was unable to address them because of her \nhealth issues. While she was willing to try to resolve them, she has made no efforts in \nworking with her creditors to resolve the accounts. The Appeal Board has previously \ncommented on a somewhat similar situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her [public trust position] is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has denied that she had begun making such efforts even after the \nSOR was issued. Her inability to do so was because of her serious health issues, \nincluding one the week before the hearing, not because of disinterest. \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant \nmanaged to save her residence from foreclosure and has continued to make timely \nmonthly payments since December 2020 and she has maintained her present accounts \nin a current status. She is burdened only by her delinquent medical accounts.  \nUnder the present circumstances, I believe Applicant should be extended an \nadditional period to start addressing her delinquent medical debts, perhaps to start \nresolving the smaller ones in the amounts $74, $109, $126, and $164. Should such efforts \nbe successful within the next 90 days, additional security monitoring under SEAD 4, App. \nC, Condition C, under the DOD Continuous Vetting Program may be appropriate until the \nissue is finally resolved within a reasonable period of extended time: \nEligibility granted or continued, despite the presence of issue information \nthat can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that \nadditional security measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s). Such \nmeasures include, but are not limited to, additional security monitoring, \naccess restrictions, submission of periodic financial statements, or \nattendance at counseling sessions. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling. Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially and health-wise than she had been as she has a good monthly \nremainder and her only delinquent debts are the original 60 medical debts and the 1 non-\nmedical account. Too many issues were obstructions beyond her control to enable her \naddress those debts. Applicant\u2019s delayed actions for such a long period, under the \ncircumstances, no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010)) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 \nF.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006). \nThere is obviously some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial \nconsiderations. She failed to maintain 61 accounts in a current status allowing them to \nbecome delinquent. Accounts totaling $52,891 were placed for collection. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she has been serving \nas a tool assistant since 2021. Commencing in 2017, a series of events occurred over \nwhich Applicant had no control. They continued up until the week before the hearing in \nthis matter. In addition to a vehicle accident and the expenses related to it, she has \nexperienced numerous health issues and unexpected medical emergencies resulting in \na CABG-2, gallbladder removal, and an angioplasty and stenting. She underwent \nrehabilitation. She does not receive any child support. Despite all those issues, when \nconfronted with the probable foreclosure of her residence, Applicant managed to have \nthat action dismissed. She has made timely monthly payments since at least December \n2020. She continues to obtain medical care but now she always pays the required copay. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther than the delinquent medical accounts and the one non-medical account, all of her \npresent accounts are current. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of efforts to resolve her debts has been stalled by her \nsignificant health issues. She has the declared intention to resolve her debts, but her \nhealth has not permitted her to do so. When healthy she has been able to work 101 hours \nduring a two-week period in an effort to earn additional salary. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant proffered substantial \nmitigating evidence, which was more than sufficient to overcome the disqualifying \nconditions established under Guideline F. Additional security monitoring under SEAD 4, \nApp. C, Condition C, under the DOD Continuous Vetting Program may be appropriate \nuntil the issue is finally resolved within a reasonable period of extended time. See SEAD \n4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.iii.:  \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of public \ntrust to support a contract with the DOD.  Eligibility is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 35 years old. Since 2021, he has worked as a laser and robotic systems operator for a government contactor. He worked as a DoD civilian employee from 2005-2013. He was married in 2010 and divorced in 2021. He has a minor child. He earned an associate degree in 2010. (Tr. 16-19; GE 1) Applicant testified that he and his wife were dating for about ten years before they got married. In about 2017, their marriage started falling apart, and they separated in August 2019. His wife kept their home and initially denied him access to their child. His wife had a job earning about $25 an hour, but his employment was sporadic, and when he worked, he did not earn a lot of money. He estimated that he only earned about $5,000 in 2017. She was paying their monthly bills and managing their joint account but was also hiding her spending. In 2016, he discovered that money was disappearing from their account and their bills were not being paid. For this reason, they had to file bankruptcy in 2016. He later found out she was cheating on him, and some of the money she was spending was in furtherance of the affair. (Tr. 19-26, 61-76; AE G, O) From 2005-2013 Applicant earned about $25 an hour. He left that job because of a toxic work environment. He reported that he was underemployed from about 2014\u00ad 2021",

He left that job because of \na toxic work environment. He reported that he was underemployed from about 2014\u00ad\n2021. During this time, he tried to salvage a family business, but he was unable to make \nit profitable. He also cared for his young daughter while his wife worked. His was paid \nabout $14 an hour in his next job in 2021. Since November 2021, he has earned about \n$26 an hour with his current employer. Applicant currently pays about $500 monthly in \nchild support and is current on his child support obligations. (Tr. 29-61, 76-78) \nIn January 2023, he hired a credit repair company. The correspondence with this \ncompany cited the attorney by name that would be representing him. He testified his \nlawyer told him not to pay anything and let them work with the creditors to validate the \ndebts, get the debts removed from his credit reports, or make settlement arrangements \non his behalf. He has been following their directions. He stated that his financial problems \nwere not due to his spending habits, and he will no longer have any joint accounts with \nanyone or cosign any debts for anyone.

The case was discharged in April 2017. \nHe reported that he filed bankruptcy because his wife was secretly spending their money \nand not paying their bills.

Prior to their separation, Applicant obtained wireless phones for himself, his wife, \nand daughter. He reported that after they separated, his wife would not give him any of \ntheir bills, and he did not know she stopped paying the bill. He learned it had become \ndelinquent when his phone was shut off. He thinks the amount of the debt is an error, and \nthe credit repair agency is challenging the debt. (Tr. 29-61, 76-78; GE 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a personal loan that was charged off for $3,257. He reported \nthat he took out the loan to consolidate some debt and pay bills after his divorce. The \ncredit repair agency is validating the debt and the amount. He asserted that he would pay \nit if it is valid. He is acting on the direction of the lawyer at the credit repair agency, not to \nmake any payments until they verify his debts. (Tr. 29-61, 76-78; GE 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a credit card account placed for collection for $761. Applicant \nreported that this debt was canceled in October 2022. He submitted the 1099-C Form he \nreceived into the record, and stated he reported it on his taxes. (Tr. 29-61, 76-78; AE N; \nGE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges an internet services account placed for collection for $223. \nApplicant testified that he has not paid it. Post hearing, he provided a statement saying \nthat on December 11, 2023, the creditor could not find his account or assist him in \nresolving it. (Tr. 29-61, 76-78; AE P; GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges an auto lease that was charged off for $13,610. This debt was \nfor a vehicle leased in 2019, prior to his August 2019 separation. The monthly payment \nwas $611. Since his wife was their main source of income, he did not have the means to \npay the lease after they separated, and the vehicle was repossessed. He provided a \ndocument from March 2020 purporting to show his early termination liability, but the \nnumbers on it are nonsensical. It is unclear what happened to the vehicle after it was \nrepossessed, and what amount is actually owed. He is waiting on the credit repair \ncompany to advise him on how to handle this debt. (Tr. 29-61, 76-78; AE I; GE 5, 7) \nApplicant provided a monthly budget statement showing that after his regular \nmonthly expenses he has $721 left over.

(Tr. 61-76; AE K, Q) \nApplicant submitted a character letter from his supervisor who stated that he is \u201cin \ngood standing with management in all regards.\u201d (AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the credit \nreports, bankruptcy records, and tax records. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),19(b), and 19(f) apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond  \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.c. The reason that Applicant filed bankruptcy \noccurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Applicant has filed his delinquent \nincome tax returns and has timely filed for the last three years. The tax related security \nconcerns have been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(e) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are not from irresponsibility. He and his ex-wife had an arrangement where she \nwas the primary financial provider for their family. He had a number of years where he \nwas underemployed, but he took care of his daughter so his wife could work. When their \nrelationship ended, she did not provide him with financial assistance, and he did not have \nthe means to pay for his own basic expenses or resolve debt. \nAfter becoming gainfully employed, he hired a reputable credit repair company to \nrepresent him in restoring his credit rating and resolve outstanding debt. Some of the \ncorrespondence with this company states which attorney is representing him. He testified \nhis lawyer told him not to pay anything and let them work with the creditors to validate the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndebts, get the debts removed from his credit reports, or make settlement arrangements \non his behalf. His actions in this regard are reasonable and responsible. He has been \nfollowing the directions and relying on professional advice that the credit repair firm and \nattorney provided to help resolve his delinquent finances. \nApplicant has a stable job and income and has found ways to reduce his monthly \nexpenses. His current credit report and household budget demonstrates his finances are \nunder control and he has the financial means to resolve debt. If necessary, he has a plan \nto get a second job to supplement his income to help pay any debts the credit repair \ncompany validates. These financial issues no longer cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he has undertaken good-faith efforts to \naddress his delinquent debts through professional assistance and representation. He is \nnot required to show that he has paid or resolved all his debts, or that he has done so in \nany particular way. He has shown that he has a reasonable plan to resolve his debts and \nhas implemented it. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered his character \nletter. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

He has a high school diploma. For the past \ntwo and a half years, he has been working as a painter for a defense contractor. \nPreviously, he worked for five years as a custodian. (Tr. 13) \nApplicant smokes marijuana. He purchases it at a marijuana dispensary in packs of \nfour pre-rolled cigarettes. (Tr. 18) Typically, this amount lasts him about one month.

He last used \nmarijuana the week before the hearing. He intends to continue using marijuana in the \nfuture. (Tr. 30) When Department Counsel asked him, during cross-examination, to \nelaborate, he replied that he is not going to stop using marijuana \u201cbecause [he] was never \ninterested in getting a security clearance.\u201d (Tr. 30) \nIn 2019, Applicant, while driving home after consuming nine beers, rear-ended a \npolice cruiser that was idling at a stop light. (Tr. 36) Subsequently, he was arrested and \ncharged with driving while impaired (DUI). He pleaded guilty, whereupon his driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for a year, and he was ordered to take a drivers\u2019 safety course. (Tr. 38) \nApplicant complied with the court order. He had never been arrested before this episode, \nand he has not been arrested since this episode. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended, he had no means of getting to \nwork, and had to pay $80 round trip daily \nfor an Uber. Subsequently, he began \nexperiencing financial problems. By early 2022, he had incurred approximately $9,000 of \ndelinquent debt. (GE 3, 4) \nApplicant has taken no steps to satisfy these outstanding debts. He contends that he \ncan start satisfying them the month after the hearing. When Department Counsel asked him \nduring cross-examination why he did not begin satisfying these debts any sooner, he \nresponded that he tends to procrastinate and does not take action on tasks \u201cuntil there is a \nfire under him.\u201d (Tr. 46) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such misuse,\u201d apply.

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national \nsecurity eligibility is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn December 12, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). \nApplicant responded in a December 29, 2022 Answer to the SOR, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) assigned the case to me on June 28, 2023, and I received the case file on July \n3, 2023.

These hearing exhibits were marked HE I and HE II, for identification, and \nappended to the record for reference purposes. Department Counsel also offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence, all of which were admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel then requested that I take administrative notice of the \ncontents of an eight-page excerpt from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, Fifth Edition (known as the DSM-5), relating to alcohol use disorder, as well as \na four-page publication from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, \nentitled Understanding Alcohol Use Disorder. Applicant had no objection, and I granted \nthe motion to take administrative notice of pertinent facts within the documents, which I \nmarked as Administrative Notice (AN) exhibits I and II. \nApplicant testified and offered the testimony of four witnesses at his hearing. He \nalso introduced Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A into evidence, which was admitted without \nobjection. I left the record open until August 25, 2023, for submission of additional \ndocumentary evidence in mitigation or rebuttal. Neither party submitted additional \nevidence and the record closed as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non August 7, 2023. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.d; but he disagreed with the assessment of the Government\u2019s duly qualified \nmental health professional that his diagnosed Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, impairs his   \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, or ability to safeguard classified information, despite \nhis unwillingness to reduce his regular use of alcohol or to engage in further treatment for \nthe condition. His admissions and explanations are incorporated in these findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. He earned a high school diploma in May 1981. He is \nmarried and has two adult children. He honorably served in the Marine Corps from 1983 \nto 1987, and then transferred to the Air National Guard where he served until his \nHonorable discharge as a master sergeant upon retirement in 2019.

He has \nworked as a senior systems administrator on defense contracts for his current employer \nsince 2020. He has held a Top Secret clearance for more than 20 years. (GE 1, Tr. 34-\n38.)  \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application in connection with his new \nemployment with the defense contractor on May 1, 2020. In the section inquiring about \nhis use of alcohol, Applicant reported that he had successfully completed a voluntary 32-\nsession outpatient treatment program, to which he was referred by his family physician to \nhelp him address his alcohol use. This treatment lasted four weeks, from September to \nNovember of 2007.

(GE 1.) \nOn June 23, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the office of \npersonnel management (OPM). He said that from 2007 to 2011 he remained sober but \nrelapsed to moderate drinking from 2011 through 2015. He described how this caused \nissues at home because of his daily alcohol intake, including whiskey, and led to some \n2016 incidents of conflicts with coworkers. He said that in 2019, his retirement from the \nAir National Guard led to increased whiskey consumption until January 2020, and several \nattempts to reduce his intake had led to withdrawal symptoms. Applicant admitted that \nhis use was habitual or excessive prior to 2020. He said that from February through April \n2020 he drank no alcohol, but he then resumed moderate beer drinking, which he \ndescribed as 6 to 14 beers per week. He denied that his use had any impact on his \njudgment, reliability, finances, or discretion. (GE 2.) \nOn June 27, 2022, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation at the request \nof the DCSA CAS. The evaluation was conducted by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional, who is a licensed clinical psychologist with a Doctor of Psychology degree. \nThe information Applicant provided during the evaluation confirmed the information \ndiscussed above from his OPM interview, including his admission to habitual binge and \nexcessive drinking, and not having followed recommendations for abstinence following \nhis two treatment programs for alcohol use disorder. He confirmed that he had \nconfrontational incidents with coworkers following heavy alcohol consumption the \npreceding nights, and that his supervisor told him that he needed to seek counseling. \nFollowing his most recent counseling, he again relapsed but tried to limit his alcohol \nconsumption to only beer and wine, which he described as a case of beer and a bottle of \nwine per week since 2020. The psychologist diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol Use \nDisorder, Severe, and her prognosis was, \u201cguarded to poor.\u201d She said that Applicant, \u201cis \nnot motivated or willing to substantially cut down his alcohol use and does not want to \nattend treatment,[or] take medications to assist with cravings, and will not attend AA \nmeetings.\u201d She concluded that there is current indication the Applicant\u2019s psychological \ncondition impairs his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, as well as his ability to \nsafeguard classified information. (GE 3.) \nApplicant testified about another alcohol-related incident during his squadron\u2019s \n2015 Christmas party. He drank to excess before and during the event, leading to a \ndisruptive and profanity-laced incident while he tried to sing a karaoke song. He further \ndescribed his current continuing use of alcohol, as including about 10 ounces of brandy, \n7 glasses of wine, and 12 beers per week. (Tr. 80-84, 85-87.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife and three of his longtime coworkers, including his boss and the \nSpecial Security Officer for the Air Force Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group where \nhe works, testified on his behalf. All were very complimentary of his character, \ntrustworthiness, and integrity. One coworker detailed a very recent security violation in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich Applicant inadvertently brought his cell phone into a controlled area, but no other \nsecurity violations were noted. None thought that he had been recently irresponsible \nconcerning alcohol consumption, and his coworkers indicated that they had never noticed \nhis good performance and work ethic to be affected by alcohol. They all expressed their \nconfidence in his reliability; and they opined that he would not pose any security risk and \nshould retain his security clearance. Applicant also submitted a letter from his wife \ndescribing his efforts to moderate his alcohol consumption and importance in their family\u2019s \nrelationships and successes. (AE A; Tr. 49-79.) \nPolicies \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]NY doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201cApplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the Applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an Applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes six conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e. \ng., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has a long and well-documented history of alcohol use disorder, which \nhas factored into both work and non-work incidents, binge drinking, and relapses against \npost-treatment program recommendations. After being diagnosed with Alcohol Abuse \nDisorder, Severe, he continues substantial daily alcohol consumption. These facts raise \nsignificant security concerns under the disqualifying conditions cited above. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could provide mitigation of the security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant completed two alcohol treatment programs but relapsed after brief \nperiods of sobriety both times. He currently consumes alcohol on a regular basis and has \nno intention of seeking further treatment or attending additional AA meetings. The \nlicensed clinical psychologist who evaluated him offered a \u201cguarded to poor\u201d prognosis \nand opined that his continuing alcohol consumption impaired his trustworthiness, \nreliability, and ability to safeguard classified information.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person \nwho is accountable for his choices and actions. His issues with alcohol abuse have \nspanned decades and the two treatment programs he completed did not produce \nsustained abstinence per the professional post-treatment advice he received. Three \ncurrent and long-term coworkers said that he has performed very well at work, but this is \ninsufficient to establish rehabilitation from his admitted and longstanding alcohol use \ndisorder. He continues regular consumption of alcohol daily, for which he received a \n\u201cguarded to poor\u201d prognosis from the duly qualified mental health professional who \nevaluated him. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or inadvertent security \nviolations remains undiminished, as evidenced by his security violation at work just days \nbefore his hearing. Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the concerns arising \nunder the guidelines governing U.S. national security eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information.

Due to an unknown administrative error, this Answer was not \nincluded as part of the initial record in this case. However, Department Counsel obtained \na copy of the undated Answer and moved to admit it at hearing as Government Exhibit \n(GX) 6. Applicant verified that GX 6 was a copy of his undated Answer and it was admitted \nas such. (Answer; Tr. 6-8) Applicant also submitted a supplemental Answer to the SOR \non February 21, 2023, and again requested a hearing. (Supplemental Answer) The case \nwas assigned to me on November 9, 2023. On December 12, 2023, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for January 12, 2024. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel moved to admit \nGXs 1-5 and 7-19 to the record. Applicant objected to GXs 13-15 over relevancy \nconcerns. These were non-governmental summaries of State DMV and court records as \nwell as a county summary of a 2015 misdemeanor citation for improper vehicle \nregistration. GXs 1-5 and 7-19 were admitted to the record over Applicant\u2019s objections. \n(Tr. 17-20) \nDepartment Counsel also moved that I take administrative notice of a July 2018 \nDOJ press release summarizing the sentencing of a woman who pleaded guilty to false \nrepresentation of a Social Security Number (SSN) after she used a credit profile number, \nalso known as a credit protection number (CPN), instead of her own SSN when applying \nfor a lease and various credit cards. The article described a CPN as a nine-digit number \nthat can often be a stolen SSN and may be marketed to individuals with poor credit history \nas a way to obtain a clean credit profile. An administrative judge may take administrative \nnotice of suitable matters including official documents posted by Federal departments or \nagencies on their websites. ISCR Case No. 99-0452 (App. Bd. Mar 21, 2000); ISCR Case \nNo. 21-01688 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2023). I declined to take administrative notice of the \npress release as I found portions of the document to be unrelated to Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances. However, the document was admitted to the record as GX 20 over \nApplicant\u2019s objections. (Tr. 12-25) \nApplicant testified at the hearing and did not submit any exhibits. I held the record \nopen through January 26, 2024, to allow both parties the opportunity to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. Applicant timely submitted additional documents that were \nadmitted to the record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AXs) A through C, without objection.

He never married, but has three children, ages four, nine \nand fourteen, all with three different mothers. He attended some college but did not earn \na degree. He served in the Army Reserve from 1994 through 2002 and received an \nhonorable discharge. He has lived in his current residence in State A since 2008. (GX 1-5; \nTr. 27-43) \nApplicant began working full-time with Employer A in 2003. He started working \npart-time with Employer B in 2015. He resigned from Employer B in late 2020 in the hopes \nof having more time to develop a rental out of a portion of his property. In about December \n2020, he was terminated from Employer A following several negative write-ups, including \nuniform violations and repeated tardiness. He was unemployed from December 2020 \nthrough April 2021 and received unemployment benefits. He was then rehired by \nEmployer B in a full-time position as a personal security officer. He has held a security \nclearance since about 2013. (GX 1-2, GX 5; Tr. 44-49) \nApplicant has experienced an extended history of financial difficulties that began \nshortly after he purchased his current home in 2008. By early 2009, he was past due on \nhis first and second mortgages. From late 2009 through early 2011, he made no payments \ntoward the mortgages. He blamed a loss of overtime and reduction in salary for his \nfinancial difficulties. Following a loan modification in 2011, he resumed his mortgage \npayments. (GX 1-5, GX 10-11, GX 17; Tr. 58-62) \nIn 2012, Applicant wanted to purchase a vehicle, but since he had recently bought \nhis house, he described having a poor debt to income ratio and could not obtain decent \nfinancing. His girlfriend at the time, and mother to one of his children, advised him to use \nwhat was described as a CPN, instead of his SSN, on his paperwork to obtain the loan, \nwhich he did. About a year later, he purchased a second vehicle and used the CPN again \nfor financing. (Answer; GX 5, GX 15, GX 17; Tr. 31-36) \nApplicant claimed that his ex-girlfriend managed the paperwork for his vehicle loan \napplications. However, he was aware that the CPN was placed in the portions of the \ndocuments that requested his SSN and he signed the relevant financial forms. He also \nprovided the creditors with a Social Security card that contained his name and the CPN \nnumber, not his actual SSN. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 2.a, 3.a) He listed an address in State B \nas his primary residence in the loan applications, even though he never resided in State \nB. He understood that his actual credit report would not be reviewed and, later, the vehicle \nloans would not show up on that report. Afterward, he registered the vehicles in State B \neven though he garaged and drove them in State A, and he maintained the State B \nregistration throughout his period of ownership. (GX 1, GX 5, GX 15; Tr. 34-43) \nIn late 2012 or early 2013, Creditor A, who financed one of the vehicles, learned \nthat Applicant had used a fictitious SSN (the CPN) in his credit application and froze his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \naccount. At his hearing, Applicant claimed that he spoke with the creditor about trying to \nissue payments on the account, but claimed to have never been told why the account \nwas frozen. Ultimately, the vehicle was repossessed while at a repair shop. He made no \nadditional payments on the loan. He paid the second vehicle loan in full. (Answer; \nGX 5; Tr. 41-43, 80-86, 95-98) \nHowever, in previous interviews with investigators, Applicant presented conflicting \nstatements over what occurred with Creditor A. During a background interview in \nFebruary 2019, Applicant was asked if he had ever used another SSN and was later \nasked about the specific number that he had used as his CPN. Applicant denied having \nanother SSN and denied knowledge of the number that he had used as his CPN. (GX 5) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nDuring a subsequent interview with an investigator in August 2021, Applicant was \nspecifically asked about the loan with Creditor A. He admitted that the loan was frozen \nafter Creditor A learned that he had used a different SSN. In a subsequent phone \ninterview with an investigator, Applicant detailed that it was his ex-girlfriend who advised \nhim to use the different SSN. (GX 5) \nAt hearing, Applicant stated that he only used the CPN for the two car loans. \nHowever, he denied any knowledge that the CPN he used was a fictitious SSN or that the \nact of using a CPN was criminal in nature. Instead, he stated that a CPN \u201cwas like a LLC \nfor individuals.\u201d He later admitted that \u201cin retrospect, CPNs are not the most ethical way \nto acquire financing.\u201d However, even with his use of a fictitious Social Security card, he \nstill expressed uncertainty over the legality of CPNs. (Tr. 31-40, 173) \nIn about 2015, he and his girlfriend separated. That same year, he purchased \nanother vehicle and used his real SSN on the loan application. In early 2016, his ex-\ngirlfriend sought full custody of their child. At hearing, he described spending significant \nfunds on legal fees to contest custody in family court. (Tr. 33-35, 99-107) \nIn his November 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he was considering filing for \nbankruptcy. A March 2017 credit report showed that he was delinquent on multiple \naccounts including his first and second mortgages, the 2015 vehicle loan and credit card \naccounts. Sometime later that year, the vehicle he purchased in 2015 began to have \nengine issues and he abandoned it at a repair shop. It was repossessed several weeks \nlater. He did not issue any additional payments on the 2015 vehicle loan. (GX 2, GX 5, \nGX 9; Tr. 58-60, 86-105) \nIn October 2018, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) He listed \n$529,272 in claimed debts, of which $422,265 were listed as secured debts. In addition \nto the 2015 vehicle loan, mortgages, a personal loan and various credit cards, he listed \nabout $10,000 in delinquent utilities and cellphone bills and about $5,000 in various \nmunicipality fines, primarily relating to parking citations. He also disclosed a monthly \nincome of $5,276, approximately $63,300 annually.

(GX 12; Tr. 53-60, 152-153) \nFollowing the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties continued. He \nexperienced a period of unemployment in late 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, while \nhe continued to address custody issues with the mother of his first child in family court, \nthe mother of his second child also pursued full custody of their child through family court. \nAlthough he claimed that the custody issues had since resolved through joint custody, he \nestimated that he paid at least $50,000 in attorney\u2019s fees over the years. (Answer; GX 1, \nGX 5, GX 7, GX 19; AX C; Tr. 46-49, 70-72; 142-146) \nApplicant never resumed payments on his mortgages following the bankruptcy \ndischarge. Instead, he submitted an application for homeowner assistance through a \nprogram in State A. In July 2023, his application was approved and he received $54,433 \ntoward the arrearage of his first mortgage and an additional $9,108 for three forward \nmonthly payments. In January 2024, he received an additional $20,263 in homeowner \nassistance to bring his second mortgage current. Based on these payments, he claimed \nhis mortgages are now current and that he is renewing his payments on the mortgages \nonce the homeowner assistance is complete. (GX 1, GX 5; AX B; Tr. 62-75) \nIn about June 2020, Applicant took out two separate loans of $13,799 (SOR \u00b6 2.d) \nand $24,064 (SOR \u00b6 2.g) to purchase two vehicles. By 2022, both loans were delinquent. \n(GX 5, GX 7, GX 19; Tr. 115-130) \nWith regard to SOR \u00b6 2.d, a December 2022 credit report showed that the loan \nwas past due. However, a December 2023 credit report showed the loan was now in good \nstanding. Applicant testified that he had been delinquent on the account, but was now \ncurrent with a monthly payment of $350. (Answer; GX 7, GX 19; Tr. 116-120) \nIn August 2021, Applicant entered into a temporary payment reduction agreement \nwith the creditor for SOR \u00b6 2.g. A December 2023 credit report showed that the account \nhad been charged off. However, Applicant testified that he still possessed the vehicle and \nhad been making payments on the account. After the hearing, he provided an account \nsummary showing a payment of $513 occurring in January 2024 and a reduced account \nbalance of $22,137. (GX 5, GX 16, GX 19; AX A; Tr. 125-135) \nWhile describing the status of his two current vehicles at hearing, Applicant \nadmitted that neither vehicle was properly registered in State A, his state of residence. \nOne vehicle had expired registration tags. The other vehicle was registered in State C \nusing the address of the dealership that he purchased the vehicle from. He has never \nlived in State C. In both instances, he stated that he was unable to bring the registration \ncurrent in State A because his account with the State A government remained in arrears. \nHe was unable to recall the amount that he owed State A but commented that \u201cit\u2019s not a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsmall number.\u201d Additionally, because he was unable to obtain the appropriate residency \npermit for where he lived in State A, he continued to accumulate parking citations with his \nmost recent occurring about two months prior to the hearing. As of the date of the hearing, \nthat citation remained unpaid. (Tr. 54, 119-139) \nIn addition to the vehicle loans, Applicant accumulated further delinquent debts \nfollowing the bankruptcy discharge. SOR \u00b6 2.c is a cable bill for $199 that appeared on \nhis December 2022, May 2023 and December 2023 credit reports. Applicant claimed that \nthe account was resolved as part of the bankruptcy.

(GX 7, GX 12, GX 18, GX 19; Tr. 135) \nApplicant also admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e ($467) and 2.f ($458) and claimed that both \naccounts were current. His December 2022 credit report showed that SOR \u00b6 2.e was past \ndue and that SOR \u00b6 2.f was charged off. His December 2023 credit report showed no \nchange in the status of either account. Applicant did not provide any additional \ndocumentation establishing that either debt had been brought current or otherwise \nresolved. (GX 7, GX 19; Tr. 136) \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.h ($675) and claimed the account was current. His \nDecember 2022 credit report showed that the account was past due. However, his \nDecember 2023 credit report showed that the account was current with a reduction in the \nbalance owing. (GX 7, GX 19) \nApplicant detailed that he currently earned just over $50,000 in annual salary and \nwas current on his Federal and State tax obligations. Although he still owed State A for \nvarious citations, he testified that his financial situation was improving, particularly since \nhis child custody cases had resolved. He also stated that he intended to rent a portion of \nhis home in the near future, which would provide additional income. However, his \nDecember 2023 credit report also showed a recent past-due debt with a cellphone \nprovider for $1,462. Applicant claimed that this additional debt was to be paid for by State \nA\u2019s homeowner assistance fund. He did not provide documentation reflecting payment of \nthis account. (GX 19; Tr. 122-126, 136-151) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility.  \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleges that Applicant knowingly provided a \nfictitious SSN in loan documents in order to secure financing on two vehicles in 2012 and \n2013 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b), and that he made deliberate false statements during his \nbackground interview in February 2019 by denying that he ever used another SSN \ninstead of his own SSN. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nA security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to intentionally \nomit potentially derogatory information. The Federal Government has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. That compelling interest \nincludes the government's legitimate interest in being able to make sound decisions, \nbased on complete and accurate information, about who will be granted access to \nclassified information. An applicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid \nanswers to the government in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the government's industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) The Government must produce \nsubstantial evidence that an omission was deliberate and not merely that the omission \noccurred. ISCR Case No. 07-16511 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009) \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of \nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or \ngovernment protected information; (2) any disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) \nevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or \nresources. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nOn two separate vehicle loan applications in 2012 and 2013, Applicant used a \nfictitious SSN in order to obtain better financial terms. Although he claimed that this \nnumber was a CPN and that his girlfriend at the time managed the loan paperwork, he \nsigned the applications and presented a fictitious Social Security card, containing his \nCPN, during the loan process. This action raises significant questions regarding his \njudgment, trustworthiness and reliability. AG \u00b6 16(d) is applicable. The general security \nconcern under AG \u00b6 15 also applies. \nAdditionally, during his background interview in February 2019, Applicant denied \never having a different SSN or ever using the SSN that he later identified as his CPN, \ndespite having used a Social Security card with the different SSN (CPN) to obtain the \nloan with Creditor A. In August 2021, when specifically asked about the loan with Creditor \nA, he admitted that Creditor A found out he was using a different SSN and froze his \naccount. His later testimony that he was unaware why Creditor A froze his account is not \ncredible. He was aware that he used a fictitious SSN to obtain the loan and deliberately \nfailed to disclose that information during his interview in February 2019. AG \u00b6 16(b) is \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant used a fictitious SSN and fictitious Social Security card in 2012 and 2013 \nto secure two vehicle loans. He deliberately failed to disclose this information during his \nFebruary 2019 interview and failed to make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the \nconcealment. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s use of a fictitious government document is not a minor offense. \nAlthough significant time has passed since he used his fictitious SSN to obtain financing \nand he no longer associates with the girlfriend who assisted him in setting up the fictitious \nSSN, he has not accepted responsibility for his actions. At hearing, he still expressed \nuncertainty over the legality of CPNs even though he had used a fictitious Social Security \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncard containing the CPN. As he was reluctant to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his \nconduct, it cannot be said that such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAdditionally, his use of fictitious information was not limited to using the CPN as \nan SSN. He registered both vehicles he purchased with the CPN in State B for years \nafterwards even though he never lived in State B. One of his current vehicles is registered \nin State C even though he has never lived in State C. His other current vehicle has expired \nregistration tags in State A as he is unwilling to bring the vehicle current with State A. \nGiven the status of these vehicles, Applicant continues to accumulate parking citations \nand fines and he continues to be in arrears for an unknown amount with State A. These \nadditional issues were not alleged in the SOR. However, they reflect a history of non-\ncompliance with basic rules and regulations and raise questions regarding his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) nor 17(d) is applicable. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19.

AG \u00b6 19(d) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nAdditionally, Applicant has a long history of financial difficulties. This began in 2009 \nand continued even after he received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2020. Recent \ncredit reports show accounts in delinquent status. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable \nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.h. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s use of a fictitious SSN and fictitious Social Security card occurred over \na decade ago and he no longer lives with the girlfriend that helped him set up the fictitious \nSSN. However, similar to the concerns discussed under Guideline E, he remained \nreluctant to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct. Therefore, it cannot be said \nthat such behavior is unlikely to recur. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable to \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances have slightly improved since his bankruptcy \ndischarge in February 2020. Following the issuance of the SOR, he has brought the debts \nunderlying SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.g and 2.h into good standing.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 31. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nUnder Guideline J, the Government cross-alleges the concerns that, in 2012 and \n2013, Applicant used a fictitious SSN in order to obtain favorable financial terms for two \nvehicle loans. He was never charged with a crime relating to these events. Nonetheless, \nhis use of a fictitious SSN and the use of a fictitious Social Security card in a financial \ntransaction is evidence of criminal conduct. AG \u00b6 31(b) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nConditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nApplicant\u2019s use of a fictitious SSN occurred over a decade ago. However, he \nprovided false statements about this conduct during his interview in February 2019. At his \nhearing, even while describing his use of a fictitious Social Security card to obtain \nfinancing, he remained reluctant to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct. When \nan applicant is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for his own actions, such a \nfailure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E, Guideline F and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant honorably served in the Army. He has held a security clearance over the \nlast decade. With the exception of a small break in 2020, he has been with his current \nemployer since 2015. In describing his custody battles involving two of his children, he \nappears to be a committed father while working to improve his financial circumstances. \nNonetheless, Applicant was reluctant to accept the significance of his financial \ntransgressions. More recently, he still maintains delinquent accounts following a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy and owes State A an untold sum for various vehicle infractions \nbecause he remains in noncompliance with basic regulations there. The seriousness of \nhis use of a fictitious SSN and his ongoing financial issues leave me with questions and \ndoubts as to his suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e-2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.g-2.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Specifically, he \nanswered \u201cno\u201d in response to three questions in Section 23, Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug \nActivity, which asked whether, in the last seven years, he had: (1) illegally used any drugs \nor controlled substances; (2) illegally purchased, received, handled, etc., any drug or \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontrolled substance, and; (3) whether he had ever illegally used or otherwise been \nillegally involved with drugs while possessing a security clearance. (GE 1 pp. 31-32) \nDuring his April 2022 investigative interview, Applicant, after being administered \nan oath, was asked whether he had used any illegal drugs in the past seven years, to \nwhich he responded \u201cyes.\u201d He first disclosed he purchased and used \u201cchocolate edible\u201d \nmarijuana in January 2022 while vacationing in a South American country. He stated he \nconsumed one marijuana edible per day over the course of five days during the trip. Next, \nhe disclosed he smoked marijuana in March 2021 after the funeral of a beloved relative. \nHe stated other persons provided him with the marijuana on that occasion; he did not \npurchase it himself. (GE 3 pp.3, 5-6; Tr. 36-39) \nApplicant then summarized his pattern of marijuana use to the investigator, stating \nhe used marijuana recreationally about twice a year since 2016, typically on special \noccasions like birthdays or big events. He described feeling relaxed, and less anxious or \nsocially awkward after consuming marijuana. When the investigator asked why he did not \ndisclose his marijuana use in his SCA, he stated he \u201cjust forgot about it.\u201d When the \ninvestigator asked about his future intent concerning marijuana use, he stated he would \nstill use it, but would reserve his use to when he was in a safe environment. He further \nstated he would not let marijuana compromise the quality of his job; and that he would \nnot become dependent upon it. Applicant confirmed to the investigator that he knew \nmarijuana was federally illegal, as discussed infra. (GE 3 pp. 5-6; Tr. 36-39, 55-60) \nIn his November 2022 response to government interrogatories, Applicant provided \nmore details about his marijuana involvement. He disclosed the exact date, place, and \noccasion he first used marijuana: on January 23, 2016, in State 1, to celebrate his \nbirthday. He last used marijuana on October 29, 2022, in State 2, to celebrate Halloween \nweekend events. He stated he purchased marijuana edibles a few times a year from a \nlocal smoke shop near his residence in State 2. He last purchased marijuana on October \n28, 2022, the day before his Halloween weekend events. During his testimony, he \ndescribed his marijuana use as sporadic and stated he probably used it less than 25 total \ntimes during the six-year period. He reiterated that he used marijuana in \u201csafe\u201d \nenvironments like his home, with a brother, cousins, or others he trusted. (GE 3 pp. 5-14; \nTr. 39- 47) When asked when, if ever, he had decided to stop using marijuana, he \nresponded: \nI suspend use of (marijuana) during work hours or when I don\u2019t feel safe. \nLast use was Halloween weekend (10/29/2022). Can and will stop if \nrequired to maintain clearance and/or perform work duties responsibly. (GE \n3 at 10) \nWhen asked the reason he decided to use marijuana in January 2016 in the first \nplace, Applicant stated: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe national conversation around THC and marijuana, especially in (State \n1), had come to a place where a lot of the stigma had been dying down. It \nwas easily accessible, and when I say easily accessible, I don't mean that I \nbought it. I mean that people around me would use it. And I made a decision, \non my birthday, safe in my home, with people I trusted that, okay, I guess, \nI'll give this a shot. \u2026 It had been decriminalized in (State 1).  (Tr. 36-37)  \nApplicant also testified that COVID-19 presented lots of stressors and challenges \nfor him. He eventually became the caretaker of his mother who has dementia, and who \ncurrently resides with him. He stated that, although he was in counseling while living in \nanother state, he had not been successful at finding a counselor in his current state of \nresidence, primarily, because he wanted a counselor to work with him in-person vice \nonline. (Tr. 72-74) \nApplicant testified he was well-educated on the federal illegality of marijuana in the \nUnited States. When asked whether he ever had any reason to believe marijuana was \never federally legalized, he responded: \nI had reason to believe that it wasn't as severe. And when I say reason to \nbelieve, it doesn't mean I was right, it just means that this was the \nimpression that I was getting from the climate of the country that, in other \nwords, it would be possible to assess one's capability to hold a clearance \nand be a responsible, contributing member to this United States society, \neven if they've used marijuana. (Tr. 49-50) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified the investigator asked whether he knew \nmarijuana was still classified as a Schedule I drug, to which he responded, \u201cI do.\u201d He \nstated his conversation with the investigator ended on that point, and that, looking back, \nhe wished the investigator had told him to stop using marijuana. He explained his belief \nthat the investigator\u2019s verification of his knowledge about the federal illegality of marijuana \nto him meant that, if he was being responsible while using marijuana, this was okay. \nApplicant was aware of his employer\u2019s drug policy prohibiting the use of illegal drugs, and \nstated he was subject to random drug urinalysis testing as a condition of employment. \nWhen asked if he was concerned about being randomly drug tested, he said \u201cno\u201d he was \nnot concerned. (Tr. 55-60) \nThe language at the beginning of Section 23, Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, \ninstructs applicants on the scope and context of questions asked in the section. It reads \nin pertinent part: \u201cThe following questions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or controlled \nsubstances or drug or controlled substance activities in accordance with Federal laws, \neven though permissible under state laws (emphasis added).\u201d Applicant testified he \noverlooked this language when he completed his SCA. He stated he denied allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.c because he did not believe his use and purchase of marijuana on \nvarious occasion were illegal at the time he completed his SCA. He asserted such \nactivities had been decriminalized in State 1 and State 2 at the time he used and \npurchased marijuana.

In his April 2022 interview, he \ntold the investigator he \u201cjust forgot about it.\u201d In his SOR response and during his \ntestimony, he asserted he did not disclose his illegal drug use or drug activities because \nhe believed his activities were not illegal. During the hearing, he repeatedly commented \non his desire to be honest. (GE 3 at 3; Tr. 14, 53-56, 62, 69-72) \nApplicant testified he was highly successful at work. He stated he was generally \nrated in the \u201cB-range,\u201d exceeding expectations. He received on the spot awards for work \nperformed in 2002 and 2021, but stated that he was just doing his job but something \n\u201cstuck out.\u201d (Tr. 74-78) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is described in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable include: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nApplicant admitted he purchased and used marijuana from January 2016 through \nOctober 2022 after being granted access (emphasis added) to classified information or \nwhile holding a sensitive position (emphasis added), and that he intended to continue \nusing marijuana. His admissions are supported by other evidence in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply. AG \u00b6 25(f) also applies, but merits further comments. SOR \n\u00b6 1.b, as amended by the Government before the hearing, reads as follows: \nb. You purchased and used marijuana, as set forth in subparagraph 1.a., \nafter being granted access to classified information or while holding a \nsensitive position. \nThe term \u201cwhile\u201d used in AG \u00b6 25(f) is significant because it defines the timing and \nscope of the disqualifying conduct addressed in the provision. It is distinguishable from \nthe term \u201cafter,\u201d which defines a different timing and scope. The amended language in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is sufficient to allege disqualifying conduct within the scope of AG \u00b6 25(f) \nbecause it includes the language \u201cor while holding a sensitive position.\u201d Applicant, a \nprogram engineer, routinely participates in classified meetings as part of his job \nresponsibilities, and he works in a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are not established. Applicant purchased and used \nmarijuana for more than six years, and as recently as October 2022. During his interview \nand his SOR response, he stated his intent to continue using marijuana in the future, but \nonly in an environment he deemed safe, and other personal caveats. Although he \nchanged his previously stated future intent over halfway through the hearing, he was \nunable to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue his misuse. He used marijuana \nstarting in January 2016 while holding a sensitive position, and he continued to use and \npurchase marijuana through October 2022, about six months after his investigative \ninterview. \nEven assuming Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and purchase was de-criminalized in \nState 1 and State 2, Applicant was aware his drug involvement with marijuana violated \nfederal law. He was also aware of, but unconcerned about, his employer\u2019s drug policy \nand random drug urinalysis testing program. Despite these facts, he continued to use \nmarijuana in what he described as a \u201csafe\u201d environment, including his home, with a \nbrother, cousins, and others he trusted. He did not provide a signed statement of intent \nto abstain from using or purchasing marijuana in the future. \nThe above mitigating conditions are not established under the facts here. \nApplicant has not met his mitigation burden. It is a long-established maxim of United \nStates jurisprudence that ignorance of the law is not an excuse for failing to abide it. ISCR \nCase No. 19-00540 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2019) (citing Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, \n45 U.S. 591, 613 (1846)). Moreover, the Appeal Board has consistently held that an \napplicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs after completing a security clearance application, or \notherwise being placed on notice of the inherent incongruity between illegal drug use, and \neligibility for a security clearance, raises questions about an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (Id.) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019)). \nApplicant\u2019s purchase and use of illegal drugs while holding a sensitive position \nreflect poor judgment and raise questions about his reliability and trustworthiness. His \nevidence is insufficient to overcome concerns and doubts about his judgment, reliability, \nand his overall willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is described in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process \nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant made inconsistent statements about his failure to disclose his illegal drug \nuse or drug activities in his March 2022 SCA. In his April 2022 interview, he told the \ninvestigator he \u201cjust forgot about it.\u201d In his SOR response and during his testimony, he \nstated he did not disclose his illegal drug use or drug activities because he believed his \nactivities were not illegal. After considering these divergent statements, and all the other \nevidence in this case, I conclude Applicant deliberately provided false information about \nhis use and purchase of marijuana on his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies in this case. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) are not applicable. Applicant did not disclose his \nillegal drug activities in his SCA. His after-the-fact discussion with the investigator about \nhis undisclosed illegal drug use, purchases, and his intent to continue using illegal drugs; \nis insufficient to mitigate his personal conduct security concerns. These late disclosures \ndid not amount to a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his prior omission in this case. The \nevidence in this case leaves me questions and doubts about whether he has overcome \nhis personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all evidence in the \nwhole-person context, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate security concerns under \nGuidelines H (drug involvement and substance misuse) and E (personal conduct). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

On October 26, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for November 16, 2023, via video \nteleconference. The hearing was then rescheduled at Applicant\u2019s request. On December \n11, 2023, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for January \n23, 2024, and I convened the hearing on that date. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and \ndepartment counsel\u2019s disclosure letter dated February 28, 2023, are marked as Hearing \nExhibits (HE) I and II. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n6. Applicant testified but offered no documentary evidence. The record was held open \nuntil February 23, 2024, to permit Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. GE 1 through 6 and AE A were admitted into \nevidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 1, \n2024.  \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file, as required, federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years (TY) 2012, 2015 through 2019, and 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.c), owed past-due federal and state income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d), and had other \ndelinquent debts totaling about $28,140 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.m). In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the \nSOR, he admitted all SOR allegations, with explanations. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old engineering logistics specialist employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2013. He was employed by federal contractors from October \n2004 to November 2010 and from May 2012 to July 2012. He was unemployed from \nNovember 2010 to May 2012. He worked as a shipping and receiving clerk from July 2012 \nto August 2012, and as a warehouse supervisor from September 2012 to November \n2013. He served in the Army from 1985 to 1997 and was honorably discharged. He \nearned an associate degree in May 2015 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2019. He has \nnever married and has one adult child, age 20. He has held a security clearance since at \nleast 2008. (GE 1-2; Tr. 25-27) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to child support costs, financial support \nfor his disabled mother and siblings, and his failure to manage his financial \nresponsibilities. He attributes his failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns \nand to pay taxes to miscalculation, his belief he could not afford to pay taxes due, failing \nto follow up after an electronically filed return was rejected, and to being overwhelmed. \n(GE 1-2; Tr. 15-40, 113-118)  \nThe evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: failed to timely file federal income tax returns for TY 2012, 2015 \nthrough 2019 and TY 2021, and that tax returns for TY 2012, 2016, 2018, 2019 and \n2021 remained unfiled as of November 8, 2022. Applicant admitted the allegation and \nclaimed he had filed all delinquent federal income tax returns.

(Tr. 35-36) His TY 2015 federal return \nwas received by the IRS in November 2017, and he received a refund. (GE 2 at 12; AE \nA at 1,17) His federal returns for TY 2016 and 2017 were received by the IRS in July \n2021, and his claims for refunds were disallowed because the returns were filed more \nthan three years past their due dates. (AE A at 1,9, 18; GE 2 at 13-14) He submitted a \ncopy of a TY 2018 return signed May 24, 2021, but the IRS reported no record the return \nhad been processed as of October 12, 2022. (AE A at 1, 6; GE 2 at 15) He provided a \ncopy of a TY 2019 return signed May 24, 2021, and noted he resubmitted TY 2019 \ndocuments because the IRS had not received them and requested that he do so. (AE A \nat 1, 7, 13-14; GE 2 at 16) He provided a copy of a TY 2021 return he claimed was filed \nin 2022 and resubmitted in response to an IRS request, which was stamped \u201cReceived\u201d \nby the IRS on December 14, 2022, and \u201cReturned for Signature\u201d on January 26, 2023. \n(AE A at 1, 5, 21; GE 2 at 19) He did not submit documentary proof he prepared or filed \na federal income tax return for TY 2012, or that returns for TY 2018 and TY 2019 were \nreceived by the IRS. \nApplicant testified as follows. He filed some returns electronically and some returns \nthrough the mail. He tried to electronically file his TY 2017 return but it was rejected. In \nabout May 2021, he paid a tax preparer to assist in filing delinquent returns. Some returns \nhave been processed by the IRS and others have not. He contacted the IRS and was \ninformed his TY 2019 return had been received, but not others, and that he should not \nimmediately refile the other returns. He was told to periodically check with the IRS to see \nif the returns had been received or processed. He regularly checked online status and \ncalled the IRS about four times. (Tr. 15-18, 27-46) Applicant submitted a signed undated \nletter from a tax preparer indicating she prepared his \u201cTax Return for [TY 2016 through \n2020].\u201d (AE A at 31) The TY 2018 federal income tax return he provided identifies his tax \npreparer and her business but does not show his tax preparer\u2019s signature. (AE A at 6) \nThe TY 2019 return reflects it was \u201cself-prepared.\u201d (AE A at 14) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: owed past due federal income taxes of about $2,785 for TY 2020. \nApplicant admitted the allegation and claimed he had been in a payment plan since \nSeptember 2021. (Answer) He submitted evidence the IRS accepted a proposed payment \nplan that required automatic withdrawal of $50 a month from his bank account in July \n2021. (AE A at 1, 8) His tax account transcript dated October 6, 2022, shows monthly \npayments from September 2021 to September 2022, and a balance of $2,785 including \ninterest and penalties of $198. (GE 2 at 17-18) His tax account transcript dated February \n16, 2024, shows a balance of $2,590 including interest and penalties of $479.

(GE 2 at 4; AE A at 1-4, 15-16, 38-39) On October 9, 2022, he reported \nhe had not yet filed a TY 2021 return and that he soon would. (GE 2 at 4) On February \n15, 2024, he made a payment of $523 for TY 2021 state income taxes.

(Answer) He submitted signed and undated copies of \nstate income tax returns for TY 2015 through 2017, which reflected he owed $109, $25, \nand $193, respectively. (AE A at 32-35, 38-39) His claim for an unspecified overpayment \nor refund for TY 2017 was denied because his income tax return was not filed within two \nyears of the due date of the return. (GE 2 at 20) He received a letter in about 2023 stating \nhow much he owed in state taxes, but he did not recall the amount. He said he would \nsubmit a copy of the letter if he could find it but did not do so.

(Tr. 73-77, 111-120; GE 2 at 28) This debt is not resolved. \nApplicant earns about $83,000 a year and about $323 monthly from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for a 20% disability rating. He has about $2,000 in the \nbank. He has a 401K account but did not know the balance. He owes about $70,000 for \nfederal student loans. He applied for a student loan forgiveness program but did not \nqualify. Instead, he has been negotiating with the student loan creditors for reduced \nmonthly payments. His financial circumstances have improved, and he is current on his \nmortgage. He benefited from credit counseling while in the Army, but he has not sought \ncredit counseling since at least 1997. He timely filed a TY 2022 federal income tax return; \nhowever, as of February 16, 2024, he owed $711 for TY 2022 federal income taxes, \nincluding penalties and interest of $66. (Tr. 73-100; GE 4-6; AE A at 1, 22) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant was informed of the importance of providing \ndocumentary evidence regarding income tax filings and payments, debt payments, \ncontact with creditors, and efforts to address or resolve his financial problems. (Tr. 24, \n68-71, 100-113) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence reflecting his failures to \ntimely file federal and state income tax returns or pay taxes due, and other delinquent \ndebts establish the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s income tax and other financial problems \nare long-standing, ongoing, and were not incurred under circumstances making \nrecurrence unlikely.

Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s health and financial problems \nwere conditions largely beyond his control, but his failure to file or to timely file his income \ntax returns was not. Additionally, he has not provided sufficient evidence he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant sought and received some assistance from \na tax preparer to file some of his delinquent returns. He has not sought or received \nfinancial counseling for his current indebtedness. His financial problems are not under \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for delinquent federal income taxes alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, and delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l.

He has not filed federal or state income tax returns for TY 2012, and with the \nexception of TY 2020 and 2022, has not timely filed a federal or state income tax return \nsince at least TY 2015.

A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It \nis an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. His failure to \nfile some federal and state income tax returns, long-term procrastination filing other \nincome tax returns, and addressing delinquent debts, including $23,753 in student loan \ndebt, indicate he lacks the good judgment and reliability required of persons who are \ngranted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-04159 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, \n2016). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, \nemployment history, military service, and honorable efforts to provide financial support to \nhis family members, and that his financial problems were caused, in part, by \ncircumstances beyond his control. However, he has not demonstrated a reliable financial \ntrack record of timely filing federal and state income tax returns, paying taxes when due, \nor addressing other delinquent debts including his student loans. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishment of a track record of timely filing his income tax \nreturns and resolving his delinquent debts, he may well be able in the future to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has been married and divorced three times. His third divorce occurred in August 2018. He has one child who is an adult . He served honorably in the Army Reserves from 1993 through January 1996. He was issued a security clearance in November 2017. (Item 5.) He has worked for his current sponsor since 2021. (Item 4.) The original SOR alleged seven delinquent debts, which the Applicant denied. After the withdrawal of A-SOR \u00b6 1.e, the A-SOR alleges ten delinquent debts, eight consumer debts totaling $56,096 and two tax liens totaling $60,221 for delinquent Federal and state taxes. None of these debts are listed as fraudulent, in dispute, or resolved on the most recent credit report. (Item 8.) Applicant blamed his former spouse for these debts. He refused to pay on the two motorcycle debts, A-SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.h, because his former spouse had taken the bikes. (Item 12 at 4.) His credit report shows the last payments for both bikes as November 2020. (Item 7 at 7.) His remaining debts, A-SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f, and 1i-1j, also remain 2 unpaid and unresolved. (Items 6-8.) He offered no explanation for these debts other than blaming his former spouse. (Item 12.) A 2021 judgment was obtained against him for A- SOR \u00b6 1.c.

I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summary by \nfailing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like \nlawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights \nunder the Directive.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). FORM \nItem 12 is therefore admitted. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the A-SOR, he denied without explanation all ten A-SOR \nallegations. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He has been married and divorced three times. His third \ndivorce occurred in August 2018. He has one child who is an adult . He served honorably \nin the Army Reserves from 1993 through January 1996. He was issued a security \nclearance in November 2017. (Item 5.) He has worked for his current sponsor since 2021. \n(Item 4.) \nThe original SOR alleged seven delinquent debts, which the Applicant denied. \nAfter the withdrawal of A-SOR \u00b6 1.e, the A-SOR alleges ten delinquent debts, eight \nconsumer debts totaling $56,096 and two tax liens totaling $60,221 for delinquent Federal \nand state taxes. None of these debts are listed as fraudulent, in dispute, or resolved on \nthe most recent credit report. (Item 8.) \nApplicant blamed his former spouse for these debts. He refused to pay on the two \nmotorcycle debts, A-SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.h, because his former spouse had taken the bikes. \n(Item 12 at 4.) His credit report shows the last payments for both bikes as November \n2020. (Item 7 at 7.) His remaining debts, A-SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f, and 1i-1j, also remain \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunpaid and unresolved.

His credit report shows a last activity date of November 2018 for this debt. \n(Item 7 at 5; Item 9.) A-SOR \u00b6 1.l, his Federal tax debt, for $59,244, arose from tax years \n2004, 2005, and 2006, with the tax lien being filed in 2014. (Item 10.) A-SOR \u00b6 1.k, the \nstate tax lien for $977 was entered in 2023. (Item 11.)   \nApplicant offers no evidence to support his denials. He offered no financial details \nsurrounding his 2018 divorce. He did not provide information about his current finances. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe documentary evidence admitted into evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are not applicable. Applicant's financial difficulties may have \nincurred in part because of his marital difficulties, which was a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. However, there is no evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He has owed Federal taxes for 20 years, with a tax lien in place since \n2014 and in 2023 incurred a state tax lien. In order to receive full credit under Mitigating \nCondition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 21, 2009). He did not establish that he has acted responsibly and made a good-\nfaith effort to pay or resolve his debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). I have considered his honorable military service. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:     \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n         Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.k: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(GE 1 -14; SOR Answer; Tr.) \nApplicant provided evidence that the 1983 and 1986 alcohol-related incidents in \nState A were actually citations, not arrests. On these two occasions, Applicant was \npulled over for speeding and the police discovered that he was underage and \ntransporting alcohol.  (Tr. 23-26) Applicant could not recall many details about his earlier \n1988, 1996, and 1997 DUIs; however, he does not dispute that they occurred. (Tr. 27-\n32) \nApplicant does recall spending 180 days in a work-release program following his \n2000 DUI arrest. At the time of his 2000 DUI arrest, he was on probation for his prior \nDUIs. After his 1997 DUI, he stopped drinking for about nine months, but returned to \ndrinking, \u201cbut cut back,\u201d and \u201cdrank to intoxication three to four times a year\u201d until his \n2000 DUI. (Tr. 32-34; GE 13) Applicant did not participate in any voluntary substance \nabuse counseling treatment between his 1997 DUI and 2000 DUI. After his 2006 DUI, \nhe participated in a \u201cwork program\u201d that lasted approximately three months. (Tr. 34-35; \nGE 5) In between DUIs, Applicant had a history of stopping and resuming drinking. (Tr. \n35-39; GE 8, GE 9) \nUp until 2019, Applicant had accumulated five DUI arrests. In 2019, he was \narrested for DUI in September with a .28 BAC. Two weeks later, he was arrested for DUI \nin October 2019 with a .32 BAC. After these two back-to-back DUI arrests Applicant had \nan \u201cepiphany\u201d that he had a drinking problem. Before his September DUI, he has gone \nhome to celebrate his mother\u2019s 95th  birthday and he stated that experience had taken an \nemotional toll on him. He started drinking three to six beers a day typically at home. \nHowever, he was drinking at a bar before his September DUI and attempted to drive \nhome. (Tr. 39-42, 64-65) It appears that his September and October 2019 DUI arrests \nwere merged and adjudicated together. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five \nyears of unsupervised probation, a $1,600 fine, and ordered to attend an enhanced \noffender\u2019s course. This class consisted of a nine-month treatment program from July 2, \n2021 to May 2, 2022, for which he received a certificate of completion. (Tr. 42-45, 61-63; \nGE 4; AE H)  \nOn the recommendation of his attorney, before his September and October 2019 \nDUI arrests were adjudicated, Applicant enrolled in an Intensive Outpatient Program. He \nwas formally admitted to the program on January 29, 2020, with a primary diagnosis of \nalcohol dependence, in remission, and was successfully discharged on April 3, 2020. \nBefore Applicant was discharged, his Program developed a treatment plan which \nprovided Applicant \u201cwill continue to use good coping skills to manage his triggers and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprepare for discharge,\u201d that he \u201cwill continue to check in with his sponsor and use his \nsober support system to manage his daily life stressors,\u201d and he \u201cwill attend groups, \nmeet with psychiatrist and prepare for discharge by using his coping skills.

(Tr. 45, \n56) Applicant acknowledged that he is an alcoholic and that if he drinks one drink, it will \nlead to drinking more. As an alcoholic, he understands he cannot drink anything. He \nrealized that with the increases in his DUI BAC levels and progression of his alcoholism, \n\u201cthe next step is death inevitably.\u201d (Tr. 46, 56) Both of Applicant\u2019s parents were \nalcoholics. Alcohol was prevalent in every family event or function. His father passed \naway \u201cabout 20 years ago\u201d and died of cirrhosis and liver cancer. His mother passed \naway in October 2022. (Tr. 66-67) \nTo maintain sobriety, Applicant attends AA meetings every day and submitted \ndocumentation of such attendance. Additionally, he not only leads meetings, but also \nserves as secretary at meetings. Having admitted he is an alcoholic, Applicant considers \nhis condition to be a mental disease, \u201cin the respect that I can \u2013 I can justify drinking in \nmy head for just about any reason. And unless \u2013 unless I recognize my disease, it will \u2013 \nit will be all-encompassing and take over my life.

During the COVID pandemic, there were no in-person AA meetings; however, \nApplicant and another AA member started their own Zoom AA meeting. Applicant leads \nthat meeting consisting of 15 to 20 individuals every day at 5:30 PM. He finds the \nfellowship in AA a supplement to staying away from alcohol. He has completed all 12 \nsteps in AA, is in the process of repeating them, and has an AA sponsor. He also \nparticipates in several other AA meetings during the week. During one of those \nmeetings, he serves as secretary to make sure rent is paid and there is money for \ncoffee, tokens, and supplies. (Tr. 48-52, 71-75; GE 1) In addition to AA, Applicant relies \non his spirituality to deal with the losses and stressors that led to his drinking. He cited \nthe Serenity Prayer as a source of inspiration and spoke of a \u201chigher power\u201d that \nprovides him strength in times of need. (Tr. 53-54) As of his hearing date, Applicant had \nserved two years of unsupervised probation without any violations. (Tr. 55) \nAlthough Applicant has had periods of sobriety in the past, his current period of \nsobriety is different from those. In the past, he did not have any support group, nor did \nhe have the coping tools he has today. (Tr. 55) He stated: \nIn the past, when I tried to forecast what the future would hold, because \nthat\u2019s what I would do \u2013 I would forecast. I would say, well, you know \nwhat? Maybe then I can do this or maybe \u2013 and that\u2019s, in my opinion, what \ngot me into the situation where sobriety did not last because it was so \u2013 it \nwasn\u2019t in the present, whereas today \u2013 I live \u2013 I live today in the present. \n(Tr. 56) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not realize he was an alcoholic until October 5, 2019. Before that he \nconsidered his DUIs to be bad luck or bad timing and did not think he had a problem \nwith alcohol. In retrospect, he was a functioning alcoholic and was able to separate his \nwork from his non-work drinking habits. His drinking never caused him problems at \nwork. He drank alone as well as in group settings. He would frequently meet at his local \nVFW with a group of friends after work. (Tr. 58-60) \nApplicant works a 40-hour week, but with accumulated paid time off, he has every \nFriday off. Having the additional time off during the week has been a \u201chuge benefit\u201d to \nmaintaining his sobriety. He owns his own home that was built in 1948 and spends a \nsignificant portion of his discretionary free time maintaining his home, gardening, and \ntaking care of his dog. (Tr. 75-77) He also participates in Homes For Our Troops \nprogram, which provides homes for disabled veterans. (Tr. 77; AE J) \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted a January 5, 2022 chemical dependency \nassessment that corroborated his sobriety. He also submitted a comprehensive \nchemical dependency evaluation dated April 13, 2023. The evaluation was completed by \na highly credentialed psychotherapist and addiction specialist. (AE F(2), AE O, AE P) \nThe report concluded: \nAfter reviewing all aspects of this evaluation including the information \nobtained in the clinical interview, the questionnaires and assessments, the \nUA screening and a review of diagnostic criteria for Substance Use \nDisorder in the DSM-V, it is this Evaluator\u2019s opinion, that [Applicant] would \nnot meet criteria for any current Alcohol Use Disorder mild, moderate, or \nsevere. [Applicant] has demonstrated remorse, insight, and has been \nextremely proactive in dealing with the events of his past. Additionally, \n[Applicant] has been sober over 3 years and pursued lifestyle changes \nthat are congruent with first order, comprehensive, and behavioral change. \nFurthermore, [Applicant] has been extremely involved in Alcoholics \nAnonymous and has spent a significant amount of time sponsoring newly \nsober people in his support group and being an example of a sober \nlifestyle. His past offenses should be considered events that lend little \nassociation with his current lifestyle. It is of this Evaluator\u2019s opinion that, at \nthis time, [Applicant] is fully capable of maintaining full licensure and \nsecurity clearance without risk associated with Alcohol Use Disorder. \nFurthermore, no additional treatment or testing is indicated at this time. \n(AE O, AE P) \nWith regard to AA participation, Applicant stated attending AA meetings has \nhelped him tremendously. He also derives satisfaction in helping others go through the \nAA process. In short, the AA meetings have provided a turning point for him. He plans \nto continue participating in and facilitating AA meetings and helping other AA members \nin the future.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 provides alcohol consumption conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired  \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d). Additional \ndiscussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant was involved in nine alcohol-related incidents involving the police and \ncourts. The first two incidents involving illegal transportation of alcohol occurred in 1983 \nand 1986 when Applicant was underage, over 37 and 40 years ago, respectively. These \ntwo incidents are of limited security significance given they are minor in nature, the \nlength of time that has elapsed, and Applicant\u2019s underage status at the time. \nThe remaining seven incidents were all DUI incidents that occurred in 1988, \n1996, 1997, 2000, 2006, and twice in 2019. Until Applicant was arrested for the two \n2019 DUIs, he was not required to attend any alcohol awareness classes. The \nrecklessness of his conduct and the severity of his alcoholism did not register with \nApplicant until these last two DUIs. The progression of his intoxication led Applicant to \nthe realization that he was spiraling downward and as he put it, \u201cthe next step is death \ninevitably.\u201d \nApplicant has a sobriety date of October 7, 2019, and has not had a drink since. \nhe participated in two programs since his last two arrests. The first program he attended \nwas on his own volition, on the advice of his attorney, from January 2020 to April 2020. \nThis program taught him coping skills he was otherwise not familiar with. By the time his \ntwo 2019 DUIs came up for sentencing, he was able to demonstrate to the court that he \nwas committed to overcoming his alcoholism. He was required to attend an additional \nnine-month program from July 2021 to May 2022. As noted, Applicant stopped drinking \nin October 2019, three months before he began attending any course. Applicant has \nembraced the AA program in its entirely not only as a participant, but also as a \ncoordinator of AA meetings, a secretary at AA meetings, and as a mentor to fellow AA \nmembers. He produced documentation of his participation in AA meetings and a \ncommitment to a lifestyle of sobriety. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received a favorable prognosis from the first program he attended and \na certificate of completion from the second program he attended. Applicant\u2019s recent \ncomprehensive chemical dependency evaluation, completed in April 2023 by a \npsychotherapist and addiction specialist, concluded that he did not meet the criteria for \nany current Alcohol Use Disorder, mild, moderate, or severe. Furthermore, the \nevaluation noted that Applicant\u2019s past offenses lend little association with his current \nlifestyle. \nDue to the accumulation of seven DUIs from 1988 to 2019, application of AG \u00b6 \n23(a) is not deemed appropriate. However, Applicant has acknowledged his alcoholism, \na point he made abundantly clear throughout his hearing testimony. He successfully \ncompleted two treatment programs and complied with all of the recommended and \nrequired aftercare. As noted, Applicant has not had a drink since October 7, 2019, \nparticipates in daily AA meetings, and had been sober three years, four months, and 16 \ndays as of his hearing date. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) fully apply. Alcohol consumption \nconcerns are mitigated. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nSecurity concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), 31(c) are established. Discussion is \nin the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the\noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nMitigation of the criminal conduct security concerns was proven under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d), for the same reasons discussed in the alcohol consumption mitigation \nsection, supra. Criminal conduct concerns are mitigated. \nWhole Person Analysis  \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations. \nEach case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant or continue \nnational security eligibility \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guidelines G and J are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed in my discussion of those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old master technician who has spent the majority of his \nadult working life working in and supporting the defense industry. As of his hearing, he \nhad successfully held a clearance for 34 years. Applicant has a documented record of \nsustained superior performance as an employee. His evaluations and reference letters \namply document this. Applicant is well-regarded by his co-workers and management. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThese favorable opinions are equally shared by his friends and associates outside of \nwork. However, apart and separate from being a model employee, Applicant was \nhaunted by alcoholism. \nFortunately for Applicant, he recognized the severity and self-destructive nature \nof his alcoholism and stopped drinking. He sought professional help and has embraced \nthe Alcoholics Anonymous program. He recognizes that one drink is one drink too many \nand takes one day at a time. Applicant also recognizes that holding and maintaining a \nclearance is a privilege. Applicant\u2019s firm commitment to sobriety is further demonstrated \nby the length of his sobriety. His prognosis and supporting evidence support a favorable \nwhole person assessment. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). Applicant\u2019s evidence was sufficient to overcome the Dorfmont presumption \nwith respect to the security concerns in the SOR. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated the Guidelines G \n(alcohol consumption) and J (criminal conduct) security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

These delinquencies consist of the \nfollowing: an auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and credit cards (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e). She admitted the SOR allegations with no additional comment. Her \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are established \nthrough her admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. (Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe delinquent auto loan in the amount of $19,428 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not \nbeen resolved. Applicant fell behind on this account in May 2021 when she was \ninvolved in a car accident that totaled the vehicle that secured the account. Her auto \ninsurance did not cover the full amount of the loss. After her July 2022 interview with a \nDOD investigator, she claimed that she contacted the creditor to make payment \narrangements but could not come to an agreement on an amount. Despite not coming \nto an agreement with the creditor, she claims that since about August 2022, she has \nbeen consistently making monthly payments on this account in the amount of $25 to \n$50. (Tr. 21-26, 47-50, 56; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe delinquent personal loan in the amount of $5,422 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b has not \nbeen resolved. Applicant opened this account to borrow money to assist her daughter \nfinancially. She fell behind on the account in March 2020 after making about five timely \npayments. She claimed that she attempted to make a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor after her July 2022 security interview, but the creditor refused to work with her. \nThe December 2022 credit report reflects a last payment date of January 2020. (Tr. 26-\n28, 50-53; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe delinquent credit cards in the amounts of $3,306 and $3,267 listed in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, respectively, have not been resolved. The December 2022 Government \ncredit report reflects a last payment date of early spring 2020 on both accounts. \nApplicant claimed that she fell behind on these accounts in 2013 or 2014 because she \ncould not afford the payments, and the creditors would not work with her. She claimed \nthat after her July 2022 security interview, she has been making monthly payments of \nabout $10 to $20 per month on these accounts, but also acknowledged that she has \nmissed some of these monthly payments on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 28-29, 31, \n53-58; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe delinquent credit card in the amount of $3,191 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e has not \nbeen resolved.

She claimed that about two-weeks prior to the \nhearing, she applied for an additional credit card secured by a $250 payment to use to \nmake payments on the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. She had not yet received the credit \ncard, so she did not make any additional payments on this SOR debt. She claimed that \nshe opened this new credit card to help pay off the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and to raise her \ncredit score. (Tr. 31-34, 58-60; Answer; GE 2-4) \nAfter her July 2022 security interview, Applicant claimed that she contacted a \ndebt consolidation company and made three $110 monthly payments to it. However, \nshe claimed the debt consolidation company was not responsive and was not providing \nresults, so she stopped working with them after those three payments. (Tr. 29-31) \nApplicant provided no documentation to corroborate her payments or her efforts \nto resolve her debts. She claimed that she provided some documentary evidence of \ndebt resolution via e-mail to the DOD investigator who conducted her July 2022 security \ninterview, but she did not provide those documents in this proceeding, and they are not \npart of the record. She claimed that she is now able to pay her financial obligations, but \nshe made the same claim during her July 2022 security interview. (Tr. 17-18, 23-24, 27-\n28; Answer; GE 1-5) \nIn addition to the aforementioned causes, Applicant claimed her delinquencies \nwere caused by unemployment, underemployment, a fire that destroyed her home in \nMarch 2021, and marriage problems. After the fire, her home was rebuilt, and she \nmoved back into it in July 2021. In November 2023, she stopped working because of a \nmedical condition and is no longer being paid. She believed that she may begin working \nagain in January 2024. She claimed that she has short-term disability insurance that will \npay her 60 percent of her salary, but she has yet to receive any disability payments. (Tr. \n31-37, 42-45; Answer; GE 4) \nApplicant earned about $3,685 per month in take-home pay from March 2022 \nuntil November 2023. She has earned about $67,500, annually. In August 2023, she \nsold her home and bought a recreational vehicle (RV) to serve as her residence. She \nhas about $8,000 in savings left over from the sale of her home, but she has not used \nthat money to resolve her SOR debts because she is worried that she will lose her job if \nshe is not awarded access to sensitive information. She also wants to save money while \nshe is out of work for her medical condition. She claimed that her estranged husband \nspent some of her savings before she was able to transfer the funds from their joint \nchecking account to an account to which he has no access. She asserted she will have \nbetween $2,000 and $2,500 per month in surplus once she returns to work following the \naforementioned medical procedure. Beginning in March 2024, she claimed she will have \nabout $7,000 in a retirement account.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs evidenced by her longstanding financial delinquencies, Applicant has a history \nof being unable to pay her debts. The above listed conditions are established, thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIt is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the \nresolution of specific debts, but she has not. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). As she has not provided this documentation, she has not \nprovided sufficient evidence that she has resolved or is resolving her SOR debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing. I cannot find that they are unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were arguably caused by circumstances largely \nbeyond her control. However, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, she must also show that she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. She has not done so because she has not \nprovided sufficient evidence of her resolution efforts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. The \nlack of sufficient evidence of the resolution of her SOR debts also means that AG \u00b6 \n20(d) does not apply. \nEven without considering the lack of documentary corroboration, two of \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts have been delinquent for at least eight years. Moreover, any \npayments she claimed to have made were after she was put on notice that her position \nof public trust was in jeopardy. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns \nonly after having been placed on notice that his or her access to sensitive information is \nin jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when \nhis or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at \n3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Finally, any payments she did make on her SOR debts \nwere de minimis and were insignificant in relation to the overall balances. She has not \nprovided sufficient evidence of financial stability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l through 1.n. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 52 years old. She never married and has two grown children, ages 24 and 30. She has worked for her present employer for about a year. Before then, she was employed by a government agency for about four years. She estimated her annual salary for 2023 was about $34,000 and with an increase in her pay she anticipated earning $38,000 in 2024.

She testified that she was going to college on and off from 2009 to 2012, full- time and part-time during different periods and continued to fund her studies through student loans. She did not take any college course after 2012. She testified that she has never made a payment towards her student loans.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non February 16, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.l through 1.n. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. She never married and has two grown children, ages 24 \nand 30. She has worked for her present employer for about a year. Before then, she was \nemployed by a government agency for about four years. She estimated her annual salary \nfor 2023 was about $34,000 and with an increase in her pay she anticipated earning \n$38,000 in 2024. (Tr. 20, 25, 62-63; GE 1) \nApplicant completed an associate degree in 2007. She used student loans to fund \nher degree. She testified that she was going to college on and off from 2009 to 2012, full-\ntime and part-time during different periods and continued to fund her studies through \nstudent loans. She did not take any college course after 2012. She testified that she has \nnever made a payment towards her student loans. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, $65,088 and 1.b, \n$33,531) The day before her hearing, she enrolled in college to complete her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. Applicant stated that she needs to do an internship to complete her degree. She \nis waiting to find out if her employer will fund some of the expenses and if she is eligible \nfor financial assistance from the college and her employer. (Tr. 21-22, 27-35) \nApplicant testified that her student loans were in a default status until sometime in \n2022. She received a notice from her student loan creditor asking her to contact them \nabout getting her loans out of default. She contacted them and agreed to pay $7 a month \nfor 52 months. She made two payments, and the creditor returned the payments because \nher loan was transferred to a new creditor. She contacted the new creditor and inquired \nabout a loan forgiveness program. She was advised that to qualify for this program her \nloans would have to be brought out of default. She was told she needed to first apply to \nthe Federal Fresh Start Program administered through the Federal Student Loan \nProgram. Once she completed that program and her loans were no longer in a default \nstatus, she could attempt to inquire about her eligibility for a federal forgiveness program. \nApplicant applied to the Fresh Start Program for federal loans on January 31, 2024. She \nis waiting for her application to be accepted. Her student loans were in default prior to the \npandemic and then were in forbearance from March 2020 to October 2023 under the \nCARES Act due to the COVID pandemic. Applicant testified that once her student loans \nare accepted in the Fresh Start Program and she completes that program, she hopes to \nstart a repayment plan. She stated she could afford to pay $150 a month because she is \nnow in a better financial position.

She failed to make the required \npayments. She disclosed the debt on her April 2022 Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) and said she was trying to pay it off. During her June 2022 interview by \na government investigator, she said she was going to contact the creditor by the fall of \n2022 to obtain the status of the debt, but she could not predict when it would be paid in \nfull. She testified that she contacted the creditor and they agreed to settle the debt. She \nattempted to make a payment of $35.62 the last week of January 2024, but it was not \nproperly submitted. Post-hearing, she contacted the creditor, and her account was \nreopened, and she said she made the payment. She anticipated making another payment \nin March 2024. She was waiting to receive the settlement agreement. (Tr. 65-67; GE 1, \n2, 3; AE B, Q, S) \nApplicant explained that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($465) has been delinquent for two \nyears. She said the balance owed is $790. She contacted the creditor and reached a \nsettlement agreement to pay $474, which must be paid in full by March 1, 2024. She said \nshe sent a payment of $25 to the creditor. She anticipates paying the settlement amount \nwhen she receives her refund from her federal income tax return. She anticipates filing \nher return soon. She is waiting for a tax document to complete it. Post-hearing, she \nprovided a statement saying that her payment was sent to the wrong account. She \ncontacted the correct creditor and was going to send a payment of $75 on payday. (Tr. \n74-78; AE D, Q) \nDuring her background interview, Applicant told the government investigator that \nshe received a letter from the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e in June 2022. She was going to \ncontact the creditor and make payment arrangements but could not predict when the debt \nwould be resolved. Applicant testified that she had not taken any action on the delinquent \naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($465) until she contacted the creditor a week before her hearing. \nShe testified she defaulted on the account in 2022. She accepted a settlement offer to \nmake a $100 payment the week of her hearing and then another payment in February \n2024, and a final payment in March 2024. At the time of her hearing, she had not made \na payment, but anticipated making one. No proof was provided that she made the initial \npayment. (Tr. 78-79; GE 3; AE D) \nApplicant testified that the delinquent account in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($288) was paid when \nher state withheld her tax refund and applied it to the debt. She did not provide documents \nto substantiate the debt is resolved. (Tr. 80-82; AE E) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.k are medical debts. Her insurance company \npaid the debts. These debts are resolved. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($1,445) was paid in \nSeptember 2022. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m was paid in 2022. (Tr. 83-86; AE F, G, H, R) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($7,477) is for a repossessed vehicle. Applicant purchased \nit in 2019 but gave it to her daughter to drive. Although the loan was in Applicant\u2019s name, \nher daughter was to make the car payments. Her daughter got behind in payments and \ndid not tell Applicant. The car was repossessed in May 2023.

Sometime later in 2023, the \ncar was sold, and Applicant received a letter advising her she was required to pay the \ndeficiency balance. She contacted the creditor two weeks before her hearing and agreed \non a settlement amount of $2,245 to be paid in installments of $100 a month until the \nbalance is satisfied. The first payment was due three weeks from the date of hearing. (Tr. \n86-93; AE I) \nThe SOR debts are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions, disclosures, testimony, \nand a May 2022 credit report. (GE 1, 2, 3) \nApplicant accepted full responsibly for her delinquent debts. She attributed them \nto \u201chardship.\u201d She had some medical issues in 2022 and other periods of time that she \nhad to take off work. If she had paid sick leave then she used it, but sometimes she did \nnot and had to take sick leave without pay. Her daughter also had an injury. Applicant \nhad to take off work and take her to doctor\u2019s appointments. Her daughter was living in \nanother state attending college. She stated she is now in a better financial position to pay \nher bills. She intends to pay her delinquent debts. She anticipates receiving a $3,000 \nfederal income tax refund and using it to make some of the payments noted above. (Tr. \n71-74, 94-96) \nApplicant took a one-day financial management class in late 2023, which required \nher to prepare a budget and review how she spends money. It also showed her how to \nsave money. She also participated in a follow-up overview of her finances after the initial \nclass. Applicant is also participating in a class that helps educate her about finances and \nbudgeting. The class meets twice a month and she has attended for several months She \ncontributes to a retirement plan through her employer but took a withdrawal from it in \nOctober 2023 and paid the penalty tax. She used the money to pay her property taxes. \nShe also took a loan from it in April 2023 that will be repaid by April 2024. She does not \nhave a saving account and has a minimal amount in her checking account. Her daughter \nlives with her and pays some of the household expenses such as for food, household \nsupplies, and the water bill. Applicant intends to return to college in the summer and \nbelieves she is back on track financially and will be able to pay her debts. (Tr. 98-108) \nApplicant provided character letters that describe her as an exemplary employee \nwith a great work ethic. She is viewed as dedicated, dependable, professional and a \nperson of integrity. She is passionate about helping others and has had a profound impact \non many lives. (AE J, K, L. M, P) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the sensitive information is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable public trust decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has defaulted student loans, numerous delinquent debts, and a history \nof financial problems. There is sufficient evidence to apply the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans that she failed to make any payments on \nfor ten years before they were placed in forbearance due to the pandemic. She recently \nmade some inquiries about getting them out of default status and has applied for a Fresh \nStart Program. She attributes her financial problems to hardship, which is interpreted to \nmean that her medical issues caused her to sometimes receive a reduced income. This \nwas beyond her control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. She did not. She ignored her student loans and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \nonly began to address them when the creditor contacted her about getting them out of a \ndefault status. \nApplicant began contacting some of creditors in the SOR shortly before her \nhearing. She made one payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c; she made an agreement to \npay a settlement amount for the debt SOR \u00b6 1.d by March 1, 2024; she agreed to make \nthree future payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e; and to make $100 payments on the \nrepossessed vehicle debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n until the balance is satisfied. Her debts are recent \nand ongoing. Her actions to resolve these debts occurred almost a year after receiving \nthe SOR. I cannot find she acted responsibly or that future financial issues are unlikely to \nrecur. Her conduct casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) have minimal application. \nApplicant resolved the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.k through her \ninsurance. She also resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to \nthese debts. \nApplicant is participating in financial counseling, and it appears she wants to learn \nmore about financial management. She is given some credit under AG \u00b6 20(c), but it is \ninsufficient at this time to mitigate her history of financial irresponsibility. She promises to \npay her debts but has a poor financial track record of making regular payments on her \ndelinquent debts and addressing them responsibly. There are not clear indications at this \ntime that her finances are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) has some application, but it is \ninsufficient to mitigate the financial security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. She does not have a reliable financial track record at this time. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a public trust position. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns raised. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.m: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He married in 2000 and divorced in 2005. He has two \nchildren from the marriage, ages 15 and 24, and a 26-year-old child from a previous \nrelationship. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2016 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. \nHe has been employed by a federal contractor since June 2021. (Tr. 15, 21GE 1) \nApplicant served in the military from 1999 to 2020 and retired honorably in the \npaygrade E-7. His career was in the financial field, with responsibilities over the years as \na financial analysist, budget manager and budget officer. He testified he was responsible \nfor operating budgets in the amount of $315 million. He received numerous awards and \ncertificates during his military service, including a Bronze Star in support of the mission in \nthe Middle East. He received disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice \nArticle 15 twice early in his military career. The first Article 15 related to illegal marijuana \nuse. He admitted he was aware that using marijuana was against the law. He said he \nused it \u201cprobably once or twice\u201d before he received his Article 15. His second Article 15 \nwas for illegally viewing pornography on a government computer. (Tr. 17-20, 37-39, 48-\n49; GE 10; AE D) \nIn June 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault causing bodily \ninjury/family member, criminal mischief between $50 and $500, and interfering with an \nemergency call. (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he was in an \nargument with his girlfriend at the time, and she attempted to call the police. He stated, \n\u201cat no time did I interfere with her making that phone call.\u201d (SOR answer) He further stated \nin his answer that during the argument, she threw a lamp at him that was still plugged into \nthe wall, and it traveled backwards and caused property damage and minor injuries to \nher. He further stated: \nAfter this event, I was not questioned by the police, Instead, they arrested \nme and charged me with Assault, Criminal Mischief, and Interfering with an \nEmergency Call. The charges against me were dismissed and I agreed to \nperform 100 hours of community service, which I completed.

He admitted he slapped her phone out of her hand \nwhile she was attempting to call the police. He testified he did not perceive this as a violent \nact. He said she threw a lamp at him that was still plugged into the wall, and she then \npushed him as he was walking down the stairs. He testified that he went to the police \nstation to press charges against her, and he was arrested. He said she had already \ncontacted the police about pressing charges, so he was arrested. He was asked what \nhappened to the charges. He testified that \u201cThe charges were dismissed after a domestic \nviolence class and then paid a fine and 100 community service hours.\u201d He further testified \nhe is no longer involved with this woman and has had no subsequent domestic violence \nissues. (Tr. Tr. 26-29) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in January 2022 and in \nhis September 2022 interrogatories, he adopted the summary of his interview. When \nquestioned by the investigator about the domestic violence events from June 2013, he \ndid not tell the investigator or add to his interrogatory statement that he had slapped the \nphone out of his girlfriend\u2019s hand to prevent her from calling the police. He also said he \nimmediately left the residence and walked two blocks to his home. He said he went to \nbed and the next morning he went to the police department to file a complaint against his \ngirlfriend. When he arrived, he said he was told there was a warrant for his arrest. He was \nadvised the police attempted to contact him at his residence the night before, but he failed \nto answer the door. He said he was asleep. He told the investigator that he went to the \ncounty court the same month that the offenses occurred, and the charges against him \nwere dropped.1 (GE 3, 7; Answer to the SOR) \nWhen Appellant was cross-examined at his hearing about what happened to the \ncharges from the June 2013 incident, he admitted his January 2022 statement to the \ngovernment investigator did not include that he had slapped the phone out of his \ngirlfriend\u2019s hand when she was attempting to call the police. When he was further asked \nabout what happened in court he testified \u201cthe case was dismissed after completion of a \nclass and 100 hours of community service.\u201d (Tr. 84-85) He was then asked \u201cDid you ever \nplead guilty to any of the three charges?\u201d He responded, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d He explained \nhe could not remember because it was ten years ago and could not recall what his pleas \nwere but did recall the outcome of the case. (Tr. 84-85) \nThe court documents reflect that in January 2014 Applicant was represented by \nan attorney, and he entered pleas of guilty to assault on a family member, criminal \nmischief, and interfering with an emergency call. He received a deferred disposition for \n18 months, which required that he complete 120 hours of community service and \nprobation for 18 months, which required he report monthly and be tested for drugs and \nalcohol. After he completed the terms of his sentence and probation, in accordance with \nthe deferred disposition agreement, his pleas of guilty were amended to not guilty and the \ncharges were dismissed. (Tr. 85-90; GE 4, 7, 8) \n1 In Applicant\u2019s statement to the government investigator, he listed the offenses as occurring in October \n2012 and he went to the county courthouse also in October 2012 and the charges were dropped.

He then stated, \u201cOutcome: charges dropped.\u201d He further disclosed on the SCA \n\u201cCase went before judge and charges were dropped.\u201d He did not disclose all the \ninformation about his guilty pleas, deferred disposition, and probation for 18 months. (GE \n1) \nIn April 2020, while on terminal leave from the military and awaiting his final \ndischarge on April 30, 2020, Applicant was traveling outside of his home state. He \nattempted to put an address into his global positioning system (GPS) while he was driving \nin a high-traffic area, and he hit an 18-wheel tractor-trailer truck from behind. Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle left the road. The semi-tractor-trailer truck stopped. Applicant testified that when \nhe came to his senses, he began walking along the roadway and railroad tracks to his \nfriend\u2019s house. He did not remain at the scene of the accident. He was experiencing \nconcussion symptoms. He did not have his cell phone with him or any identification. He \nsaid he walked between an hour or an hour and a half and arrived at his friend\u2019s house. \nHe used her telephone to contact another friend whose house he had been at before the \naccident. He asked his friend to pick him up and take him to the hospital where he was \ndiagnosed with a concussion. Applicant testified that he has had concussions in the past \nand has post-concussion syndrome and is more susceptible to them. (Tr. 29-34, 39-41; \nGE 4, 5, 6; AE G) \nApplicant testified that later while at the hospital, he contacted the police advising \nthem he had been involved in a vehicle accident. He provided the police his address and \nthey spoke with him later. He testified that he was told he would be charged with hit and \nrun, failure to stop, and possession of marijuana. He testified that the police told him that \nseveral items had been found outside of his vehicle and that marijuana was found around \nthe area as well. He denied to the police that the marijuana belonged to him. During his \nJanuary 2022 background interview, he told the investigator that he was told by the police \nthat the marijuana was found either in or around the backpack. The police report stated \nthat, a pistol magazine with 9 mm bullets loaded into it was found in the glove \ncompartment. The report also stated that about 30 feet away from the car in the woods, \nthe police officer found a backpack that contained a loaded Ruger P95 pistol with a \nmatching magazine and an orange vial with a green, plant-like material inside.

(Tr 34-37, 54-59, \n71; GE 3, 6) \nApplicant was charged with felony failure to stop/accident, following too closely, \nand possession of marijuana. He testified that he did not intentionally leave the scene of \nthe accident. Rather when he walked away it was \u201cunknowingly,\u201d presumably due to his \nconcussion. He was represented by an attorney and pursuant to a plea agreement, he \npled guilty to misdemeanor failure to stop/accident, the felony was reduced, and the other \ncharges dismissed. The sentence was not part of the plea agreement. He was sentenced \nto six months in jail. Five and a half months of the six-month jail sentence was suspended \n\u201cfor a period of five years conditions upon being of good behavior, keeping the peace, \nobey this order, and paying fines and costs.\u201d He was also placed on probation for five \nyears. He paid the fine. The suspended sentence and probation continue until September \n2025.

He also testified that he did not know he was \non probation because he did not to have to report to anyone. He said he was never told \nby his attorney he was on probation. (Tr. 42-44, 51, 62-69, 81-83; GE 3, 5, 8) \nApplicant disclosed on his September 2021 SCA that he was charged with a \nmisdemeanor in March 2021 for failure to stop.2 He admitted he was sentenced and under \nthe section: Conviction Details he wrote: \u201cJudge sentenced me to 5 days in jail.\u201d No other \ninformation about this conviction was provided.

I \ndenied the marijuana belonged to me, and the charge was dropped by the \nprosecution. I pled guilty to the Failure to Stop and complied with \nsentencing. (Answer to SOR) \nApplicant was asked at his hearing if he had been arrested for any other traffic \nincidents. He said he had received a speeding ticket, which is not a criminal traffic offense. \nHe was then asked if he had any traffic charges such as reckless driving, driving while \nintoxicated, or driving on a suspended license.

(Tr. 22-\n24; AE B-N) \n \n \n \n \nI did not find Applicant credible. Any derogatory information that was not alleged \nwill not be considered for disqualifying purposes but may be considered in the application \nof mitigating conditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person \nanalysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nIn 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault causes bodily \ninjury/family member, criminal mischief between $50 and $500, and interfering with an \nemergency call. He entered pleas of guilty to assault on a family member, criminal \nmischief, and interfering with an emergency call. He received a deferred disposition for \n18 months, which required that he complete 120 hours of community service and \nprobation for 18 months, which required he report monthly and be tested for drugs and \nalcohol. After he completed the terms of his sentence and probation, in accordance with \nthe deferred disposition agreement, his pleas of guilty were amended to not guilty and \nthen the charges were dismissed. \nIn April 2020, Applicant was charged with felony failure to stop/accident, following \ntoo closely, and possession of marijuana. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pled guilty to \nthe misdemeanor offense of failure to stop/accident and the other charges were \ndismissed. He received a six-month jail sentence, of which five and half months was \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nsuspended for five years, and he is on probation for five years which ends in September \n2025. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant was convicted of assault causes bodily injury/family member, criminal \nmischief between $50 and $500, and interfering with an emergency call. Although, this \ncase is more than ten years old, I found that Applicant repeatedly was not forthcoming, \nevasive, and lacked candor about the facts and the disposition of the charges. I believe \nhe was not completely truthful while testifying. \nIn April 2020, Applicant was charged with felony failure to stop/accident, following \ntoo closely, and possession of marijuana. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pled guilty to \nthe misdemeanor offense failure to stop/accident and the other charges were dismissed. \nHe received a six-month jail sentence, of which five and half months was suspended for \nfive years, and he is on probation for five years which ends sometime in September 2025. \nI cannot find that Applicant is successfully rehabilitated as he repeatedly has \nattempted to minimize the gravity of his criminal conduct for which he pleaded and was \nfound guilty. He has therefore, not taken full responsibility for his actions. He remains on \nprobation until September 2025, which indicates the state where he was convicted \ncontinues to have concerns about him. It specifically suspended his sentence for five \nyears subject to him complying with various terms. Those terms have not expired. I cannot \nfind future misconduct is unlikely to recur. His behavior continues to cast doubts on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will\nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination,\nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national\nsecurity eligibility:  \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging \nin activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.  \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 arrest, charges, and deferred prosecution for assault bodily injury/family \nmember, criminal mischief, and interfering with an emergency call and his 2020 charge and \nconviction for failure to stop/accident (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) as alleged under Guideline J, were \ncross-alleged (SOR \u00b6 2.a) under the personal conduct guideline. That conduct reflects \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nnot perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder the criminal conduct guideline. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and \n16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was serious. He has minimized his culpability and not fully \nacknowledged his responsibility for his conduct, which raises concerns that he is not truly \nrehabilitated. I cannot find that future inappropriate conduct is unlikely to recur. His \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. None of the mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are sufficiently \napplicable to overcome Applicant\u2019s conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, awards, certificates, and character letters. \nHe has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct and Guideline E, personal conduct. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He married in 2021, after a 15-year courtship. He has \nno children. He is currently employed by a government contractor, where he has worked \nfor approximately two years. He holds two associate degrees and a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nThis is his first application for a security clearance. (Tr. 6, 20, 28; GE 1; AE K-L) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged with alcohol-related \ncriminal offenses on six occasions: (1) in November 2003, he was charged, convicted \nand sentenced for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI); (2) in March 2011, he \nwas charged with DUI and refusal to take a chemical test for alcohol, for which he was \nconvicted and sentenced; (3) in August 2011, he was charged with DUI, which charge \nwas dismissed; (4) In December 2013, he was charged with intoxication and criminal \ntrespass, for which he was convicted on the intoxication charge and sentenced; (5) in \nSeptember 2017, he was charged with public intoxication, which charge was dismissed; \nand (6) in June 2020, he was charged with intoxication, which charge was reduced to \ndisorderly conduct as part of a plea in abeyance. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR: (1) cross-alleged the Guideline J allegations above;\n(2) alleged that Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication, at various times,\nfrom 2003 to September 2022; and (3) alleged that he was court-ordered to attend\nsubstance-abuse outpatient counseling from August 2011 to about February 2012.\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c) \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was 18 or 19 years old, in about 2001 \nto 2002. He did this to socialize with friends. Starting in about 2010, he would consume \nabout a six-pack of beer or a few shots at social gatherings. During this time, he would \ntypically drink to intoxication. He would become intoxicated after drinking four to six \nbeers, or three glasses of wine. He became louder and less inhibited when he was \nintoxicated. During the end of his college days in 2015, he was drinking 8-12 beers a \nday, four to five days a week. In 2022, he was consuming one to two glasses of wine \none to two times a week, and one to two bottles of wine over the weekend with his wife. \nHe testified that his current consumption of alcohol is \u201ca few beers, here and there on \nweekends with my wife.\u201d (Tr. 20; GE 2) \nThe details of his arrests and alcohol consumption of concern follow: \nJune 2020 Intoxication Charge (SOR \u00b6 1.a)-Applicant had an argument with his \nfianc\u00e9e (now wife) and left his home to go drink at a bar. During his statement to an \ninvestigator, he claimed he drank three beers and two shots in a three-hour period. \nDuring his hearing testimony, he stated he drank five to six beers on that occasion. He \nbecame loud and disruptive and the police were called. He was arrested and taken to \njail, where he was released the next day. A plea agreement was reached and the \nintoxication charge was dismissed and he pleaded to a disorderly conduct charge, \nwhich was held in abeyance for a year. He completed the year without any violations \nand the disorderly charge was dismissed. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1-2; SOR answer; AE I) \nSeptember 2017 Intoxication Charge (SOR \u00b6 1.b)-During his background \ninvestigation, Applicant admitted being at a bar from about 10 pm to 11 pm. He \nconsumed two to three pitchers of beer. He left the bar and someone from the bar \ncalled the police registering a noise complaint. The police arrived and gave him a ride to \nhis home. He was later cited for intoxication. The citation was dismissed for lack of \nevidence. (GE 2; SOR answer) \nDecember 2013 Intoxication and Criminal Trespass (SOR \u00b6 1.c)-During his \nbackground investigation, Applicant admitted that he had been drinking 8 to 10 beers at \nhis home when he decided to walk to a local store to purchase more beer. At the store, \nhe encountered people outside who he believed were selling drugs. He confronted the \npeople and eventually the police were called. When the police arrived, he was arrested \nfor being intoxicated. He pleaded no contest to the intoxication charge and the criminal \ntrespass was dismissed. He was also ordered to undergo an alcohol evaluation. He \nparticipated in an evaluation in April 2014, and no program referral was recommended. \n(GE 2; SOR answer; AE H) \nAugust 2011 DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.d)-Applicant denied this arrest in his answer and \nthere is no discussion of this incident during his background interview.

Applicant drank several beers and had some shots \nbefore leaving the club. Applicant was driving and was stopped immediately upon \nleaving the parking lot by law enforcement. Applicant was told the reason for the stop \nwas because he spun his tires coming out of the parling lot. He refused a breathalyzer \ntest at the scene and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of DUI. Blood was later \ndrawn from him. The results of the blood test are not in the record. He was charged with \nDUI and pleaded guilty to the charge in July 2011. His other charges were dismissed. \nThe court treated this conviction as a second DUI for sentencing purposes because of \nhis November 2003 DUI, described infra. He was sentenced to 180 days jail time, but \n170 days were suspended. He was also sentenced to one year of probation, fined, and \nordered to attend alcohol counseling. He participated in a group alcohol counseling \nprogram from August 2011 to February 2012. No treatment records were made apart of \nthis hearing record. He provided two negative urinalysis tests that he took as part of the \ncounseling program. Applicant claims he was not diagnosed while in the program and \nthat no recommendations were made about his future alcohol consumption. (Tr. 23-24; \nGE 2; SOR answer; AE E-G) \nNovember 2003 DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.f)-At 1:30 am, Applicant was driving home from a \nfriend\u2019s house where he had been drinking alcohol. He was under the legal age to drink \nalcohol at the time. His car was stopped by law enforcement for a traffic violation. He \nwas given a breathalyzer test, which produced a result of .16 percent blood alcohol \ncontent which is over the legal limit. As a minor, no amount of alcohol in his blood \nsystem is permitted. He admitted drinking approximately 32 ounces of beer at the \ngathering. He was charged with DUI and pleaded guilty in January 2004. He was \nsentenced to 30 days jail time, suspended; probation for one year; and fined. (GE 2; \nSOR answer; AE D) \nApplicant also testified that he has not attended any additional alcohol treatment \nprograms other than described supra. He also claimed that he abstains from drinking \nalcohol periodically for about 60 to 90 days at a time, but no specific dates were \nprovided. He did not provide any corroboration for these claimed periods of abstinence. \nHis wife provided a written statement and claimed that he \u201crarely indulges in alcohol, \nespecially not to excess. . . .\u201d He admitted that he last drank alcohol three weeks before \nhis hearing and that he was last intoxicated from alcohol between one and two years \nago when he drank a few beers and had a few shots of whiskey. His background \ninvestigator noted that when he contacted Applicant in early 2022 to set up the \ninterview, Applicant told the investigator that he was finishing up his workday and was \nworking on his second bottle of wine. He was working from home that day. The \ninvestigator noted the call was at 3:30 pm. At his hearing, Applicant testified that the call \nwas after his work hours, but he admitted drinking that much wine that day. He was not \ndisciplined for the incident by his employer. (Tr. 21, 26-28, 31, 36, 39-40, 47; GE 2; AE \nV2-V3, V4) \nApplicant does not attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (AA). He does not \nbelieve that the AA program is a good fit for him.

This counseling was provided through his employment. \nHe admitted the sole reason he sought this counseling was due to having this hearing. \nThe therapist provided a letter stating that Applicant is doing well in therapy. He also \nstated that he was pleased Applicant made the decision to remain alcohol free. (Tr. 20-\n21-22, 24-25, 37; AE W) \nApplicant presented six character letters from family, friends, a former coworker, \nand his current team supervisor. They describe Applicant as intelligent, responsible, and \nsomeone who is dedicated, hard-working, and trustworthy. Several commented how he \nhas improved himself over the years. His current supervisor recommends that he be \nconsidered for a security clearance. Applicant also provided two certificates he was \nawarded. (AE M-N, P-S, U-V2-V3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be\nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in\ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness; and \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant\u2019s two DUIs and three other alcohol-related arrests between 2003 and \n2020 constitute a pattern of criminal conduct. I find that both disqualifying conditions \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e and 1.f. The alleged DUI in August 2011 was not \nestablished by the evidence. Therefore, SOR \u00b6 1.d is found for Applicant. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under AG \n\u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s last adverse alcohol arrest occurred in April 2020. This might be \nconsidered attenuated by time, but for his four earlier arrests on alcohol-related \ncharges, including two DUI convictions in 2003 and 2011. He claims he has modified his \ndrinking pattern since his 2020 arrest, however, his testimony in that regard is \ninconsistent and contradictory. He claims to have had periods of abstinence of 60 to 90 \ndays, but he still continues to consume alcohol. He apparently told his therapist he was \nmaintaining an alcohol-free lifestyle, yet he testified that he continues to consume \nalcohol. He last consumed alcohol three weeks before his hearing and was last \nintoxicated approximately one year before. He admitted drinking more than one bottle of \nwine when his background investigator called him to set up his interview in 2022. His \nactions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) do not substantially apply. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s two DUI arrests, his three other alcohol-related arrests, and his \ndescription of his drinking habits support the application of the above disqualifying \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions. However, I find that his court-ordered attendance at an alcohol treatment \nprogram in 2011 does not establish any disqualifying condition, rather it may be \nconsidered as a mitigating factor. Therefore, SOR \u00b6 2.c is not established. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption under \nAG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s last adverse alcohol incident occurred in April 2020. This might be \nconsidered attenuated by time, but for his four earlier arrests on alcohol-related \ncharges, including two DUI convictions in 2003 and 2011. He claims he has modified his \ndrinking pattern since his 2020 arrest, however, his testimony in that regard is \ninconsistent and contradictory. He claims to have had periods of abstinence of 60-90 \ndays, but he still continues to consume alcohol. He apparently told his therapist he was \nmaintaining an alcohol-free lifestyle, yet he testified that he continues to consume \nalcohol. He last consumed alcohol three weeks before his hearing and was last \nintoxicated between one and two years ago. He admitted drinking more than one bottle \nof wine when his background investigator called him to set up his interview in 2022. His \nactions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n23(a) does not apply. \nApplicant does not participate in AA, but rather relies on friends and family to \navoid overindulging with alcohol. His claim of periodic abstinence, without corroboration, \nor recent evidence of treatment success, is not credible. He completed court-ordered \ntreatment in 2011, but no details from that program are in the record. AG \u00b6 23(b) does \nnot apply. Furthermore, his repeated alcohol-related incidents after such treatment \nindicate he has not successfully addressed his problem. In his October and November \n2023 sessions with a therapist, he apparently told the therapist he was committed to \nremaining alcohol free, which is inconsistent with his hearing admission where he stated \nhe continues to drink alcohol.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s letters of \nrecommendation and his certificates. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines J and G. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except  \nas 2.a refers to the allegation \nstated in 1.d) \nSubparagraphs 2.c: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on May 17, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 5, 2024.

(Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II) \nOver Applicant\u2019s objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe requests. Without objection, I have sua sponte taken administrative notice of facts \nabout relations between the United States and Country A as provided in a document \npublished on the U.S. Department of State website (HE III). The pertinent facts are \nsummarized in the written requests and fact sheets and will not be repeated verbatim in \nthis decision. \nOf note is that China is an authoritarian state dominated by the Chinese \nCommunist Party, with a poor record with respect to human rights. The United States \nfaces a serious threat to its national security from Chinese intelligence operations. \nChina aggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected information, and Chinese actors \nare the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic espionage. \nThe United States has friendly relations with Country A. They cooperate on a full \nrange of issues including defense, counterterrorism, non-proliferation, trade, law \nenforcement, energy policy, and cultural exchange. There is a significant threat of \nterrorism and ongoing human rights problems in Country A. Restricted dual-use, military \nand electronic components, and internet technology have passed through Country A on \ntheir way to restricted destinations, such as Iran and Iraq. \nWithout objection, I have taken administrative notice of the reporting \nrequirements established in Security Executive Agent Directive 3 (SEAD 3), Reporting \nRequirements for Personnel with Access to Classified Information or Who Hold a \nSensitive Position, effective on June 12, 2017.

(Tr. at 37-39, 83-85; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2) \nApplicant returned to Country A on personal travel in March 2016. He again paid \nMs. X for sexual services. He stated that after returning to the United States, Ms. X sent \nhim a text asking him to help finance her relocation back to China. He sent her about \n$7,500 in April 2016. He denied that it was a blackmail payment. He stated that he sent \nthe money out of compassion. Ms. X continued to send requests for additional money, \nbut he did not send her any additional funds. He told her that he did not want her to \ncontact him again. (Tr. at 25, 31-37, 66-71; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant did not tell his work colleagues in Country A or his company\u2019s security \nofficials about his involvement with foreign prostitutes. He knew his conduct could \njeopardize his security clearance, but he stated that was not why he did not tell his \ncolleagues. He stated that he does not discuss his personal life, including his sexual \nactivities, with colleagues. He does not believe those conversations are appropriate in \nthe workplace. He stated that he told his wife about his involvement with prostitutes in \nabout March 2016 after he returned from Country A. She was very upset. She passed \naway in 2017. There is no evidence as to whether his children are aware of his conduct. \nThree of his character references, including two who are also his friends, are unaware \nof his conduct. Applicant stated that he \u201cis not proud of what [he] did.\u201d (Tr. at 35, 53, 71-\n75, 78-80, 97-99; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE G-I) \nApplicant testified that he reported his involvement with foreign prostitutes to his \nsecurity officer in about March 2016, shortly after he told his wife. The Government did \nnot present authority, such as a directive or an order, that Applicant had a duty to report \nhis conduct, but Applicant admitted that he felt that he had an obligation to do so. He \nalso reported the conduct during polygraph examinations in the second half of 2016. His \nsecurity clearance for another government agency was revoked by another government \nagency in 2018 because of his sexual behavior. He stated the revocation was still under \nappeal. (Tr. at 52-55, 71-77, 99-100; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nSeptember 2018. He listed Ms. X as one of his foreign contacts. He reported that his \nsecurity clearance was suspended, revoked, or denied by another government agency \nin 2018 for sexual behavior.

Ms. Y is a \nChinese citizen who had been living in the United States as a permanent resident for \nabout seven years when they met. They dated several weeks and became intimate in \nlate October 2020. They maintained a dating and intimate relationship through January \n2021. He stated that he did not know she was a Chinese citizen when they started \ndating, and only learned that later in their relationship. (Tr. at 39-51, 87-91; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2) \nThe SEAD 3, effective on June 12, 2017, provides the reporting requirements for \npersonnel with access to classified information. The reporting requirement: for \nassociation with foreign nationals is as follows: \n2) Continuing association with known foreign nationals that involve bonds \nof affection, personal obligation, or intimate contact; or any contact with a \nforeign national that involves the exchange of personal information. This \nreporting requirement is based on the nature of the relationship regardless \nof how or where the foreign national contact was made or how the \nrelationship is maintained (i.e. via personal contact, telephonic, postal \nsystem, Internet, etc.). The reporting of limited or casual public contact \nwith foreign nationals is not required absent any other reporting \nrequirement in this directive. Following initial reporting, updates regarding \ncontinuing unofficial association with known foreign nationals shall occur \nonly if and when there is a significant change in the nature of the contact. \nHeads of agencies or designees may provide specific guidance and \nexamples of updated reporting situations. \nApplicant stated that he informed his security officer about Ms. Y when their \n\u201crelationship went to the next level,\u201d and within about two weeks or less of his learning \nthat she is a Chinese national. The security officer told him that if he was getting serious \nwith Ms. Y then he needed to report it, which he did. He stated that he stopped dating \nMs Y because she is a Chinese national. (Tr. at 40, 47-51, 55-56, 93-95. 99-100) \nApplicant expressed remorse for his involvement with foreign prostitutes. He \nstated that he was \u201c7,000 miles away from [his] family, feeling lonely, and the \nopportunity presented itself. And yes, it was a poor choice on [his] part.\u201d He stated that \nhis conduct in Country A was the only time he ever frequented prostitutes, he has not \ndone so since, and the conduct will not be repeated. He asserted that his behavior has \nnever affected his ability to protect classified information, and that he will never allow his \nconduct to be used to extort or coerce him into divulging classified information. (Tr. at \n16, 26, 29, 56, 66-67, 84-86; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance and strong \nmoral character.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nApplicant held a top secret security clearance with access to SCI while working \nfor a defense contractor in Country A in 2015. He engaged prostitutes to provide sexual \nservices for money, including about 15 to 20 times with a Chinese citizen. He returned \nto Country A on personal travel in March 2016. He again paid the Chinese citizen in \nexchange for sexual services. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and conduct created a \nheightened risk and a potential conflict of interest, and made him vulnerable to \nexploitation, pressure, and coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(i) have been raised by the evidence. \nApplicant engaged in a romantic and intimate relationship with Ms. Y, a Chinese \ncitizen, in 2020. China is an authoritarian state dominated by the Chinese Communist \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nParty, with a poor record with respect to human rights. The United States faces a \nserious threat to its national security from Chinese intelligence operations. China \naggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected information, and Chinese actors are \nthe world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic espionage. Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith Ms. Y created a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are \napplicable to that relationship. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nApplicant does not have any ongoing contact with foreign prostitutes, nor with \nMs. Y. At this time, it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \nApplicant paid foreign prostitutes for sex while working in Country A. That \ncriminal conduct reflected a lack of judgment and made him vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nThe SOR cross-alleged the sexual behavior under the personal conduct \nguideline. I will discuss mitigating conditions for both guidelines in the personal conduct \nanalysis. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing;  \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country;  \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the foreign influence allegations under personal \nconduct. Applicant\u2019s involvement with foreign prostitutes in Country A, including with \nMs. X, a Chinese citizen, reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable, because the conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the \nsexual behavior guideline (see below). However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established for that conduct. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a also cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s relationship with Ms. Y, a Chinese \ncitizen, as personal conduct. While I believe this relationship is most appropriately \naddressed under Guideline B, several factors raise questions about Applicant\u2019s \njudgment. He shared that he was an engineer on his profile for the online dating service \non which he met Ms. Y. His security clearance with another government agency was \nrevoked in 2018 because of his involvement with foreign prostitutes, with at least one a \nChinese citizen. He then became involved with a woman who he learned was a Chinese \ncitizen. That is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 16(c). \nSOR \u00b6 3.b \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked by another \ngovernment agency in 2018 because of his sexual behavior. That sexual behavior is \nalready alleged under SOR \u00b6 3.a. There is no additional conduct alleged under SOR \u00b6 \n3.b, only the consequences of that conduct. When the same conduct is alleged twice in \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nthe SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005). Additionally, the decision of another agency to revoke Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance more than six years ago is not relevant to my decision, which must be made \nindependently. SOR \u00b6 3.b is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 3.c \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that Applicant concealed his conduct with the foreign \nprostitutes in Country A from his coworkers because he was concerned that it would be \nreported to his security department. This allegation fails for several reasons. Applicant \nhas no obligation to report his conduct to his coworkers. This allegation, even if true, is \npart and parcel of the concerns connected to the underlying conduct. As such, it does \nnot raise any independent security concerns. SOR \u00b6 3.c is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 3.d \nSOR \u00b6 3.d alleges that Applicant \u201cfailed to timely report to [his] security office the \nconduct alleged in paragraphs 1.a and 1.b above [frequenting foreign prostitutes in \nCountry A].\u201d The Government did not submit evidence that Applicant had a duty to \nreport his conduct to his security office. The SEAD 3 became effective on June 12, \n2017, long after the conduct. There was no evidence of a predecessor order or directive \nthat might have required Applicant to report the conduct. Additionally, there was no \nevidence to rebut Applicant\u2019s testimony that he reported the conduct to his security \nofficer in March 2016 after he returned to the United States. SOR \u00b6 3.d is concluded for \nApplicant. \nSOR \u00b6 3.e \nSOR \u00b6 3.e alleges that Applicant \u201cfailed to timely report to [his] security office the \nrelationship alleged in Paragraph 1.c above [relationship with Ms. Y].\u201d Applicant had a \nduty to report his relationship with Ms. Y once they developed bonds of affection and \nbecame intimate. Applicant testified that he reported his relationship with Ms. Y to his \nsecurity officer. The Government did not prove by substantial evidence that Applicant \nfailed to report his relationship with Ms. Y. SOR \u00b6 3.e is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThere is no evidence that Ms. Y was a prostitute. Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress was reduced or eliminated when he broke up with \nher. AG \u00b6 17(e) is applicable to that conduct, but the judgment aspects of the \nrelationship will be discussed further. \nApplicant has not been involved with prostitutes in more than eight years. He \napparently informed his wife of his conduct before she passed away, and the DoD is \naware of it. All of these things have reduced Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. However, there is no evidence that his children and other \nmembers of his family know about it, and many of his friends do not know about it. As \nApplicant stated, he \u201cis not proud of what [he] did.\u201d While the passage of time since an \napplicant last engaged in conduct is a relevant factor that should be considered, even \ndated conduct can be the source of an applicant\u2019s current vulnerability to coercion or \ninfluence. See ISCR Case No. 22-01002 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024). \nApplicant has attempted to avoid the stigma attached to his involvement with \nprostitutes by not telling his friends. That is understandable, but it means that the \nconduct continues to serve as a basis for coercion, exploitation, and duress. \nAdditionally, I have serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment. He held a top secret \nsecurity clearance with access to SCI when he was engaged the services of prostitutes, \nincluding a Chinese citizen, in a country that had a significant threat of terrorism, \nongoing human rights problems, and was monitoring him. He compounded the problem \nby returning to Country A and reengaging the services of Ms. X. Finally, knowing his \nclearance was revoked because of his involvement with a Chinese prostitute, he \nbecame romantically involved with My Y, a Chinese woman he met through an online \ndating service. \nI am unable to conclude that problematic conduct is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNone of the sexual behavior and personal conduct mitigating conditions are sufficiently \napplicable to overcome security concerns about his poor judgment and vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B, D, and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, but he did not mitigate security \nconcerns under Guidelines D and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage \u201c1.a through 1.c,\u201d and \nfinding \nagainst \nhim \non \nthe \nlanguage \u201c1.a and 1.b\u201d) \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

With \nhis Answer, Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through L, which were admitted \ninto evidence without objection. AE L was described on the record but not formally listed \nwhen I admitted Applicant\u2019s evidence. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony \nof any other witnesses. I kept the record open after the hearing until January 9, 2024, to \nenable Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted AE M (response \nto security department), AE N (employment letter June 27, 2019), AE O (rescind \nemployment letter July 12, 2019), AE P (truck loan statement dated November 29, 2023), \nAE Q (email June 20, 2019), AE R (termination letter July 8, 2019), AE S (government \ncredit card, March 3, 2017), and AE T (credit report, January 9, 2024), which were \nadmitted without objection. AE Q and AE R are duplicate submissions to AE H and AE K. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 4, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admits the nine debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i, which are cross \nalleged under SOR \u00b6 2.a. The debts involve collections, charge-offs, and a tax lien. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. He denied SOR \u00b6 2.d, citing to the \ndetails provided in his exhibits. He admitted he failed to disclose the details listed in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old system cloud administrator. He has worked for his \nsponsor since September 2021. He currently earns $100,000 annually. He was granted \nhis first clearance in 2010. He graduated high school and served honorably in the Navy \nReserve from 2010 through 2018. He is twice divorced, most recently in 2018. In the \nrecent divorce he took responsibility for the majority of the debts because he was the one \nthat was working the most. His former spouse received the house and they each claimed \ntheir respective vehicles. He resides with his father. (GE 1; Tr. at 22-24, 28.) He stated \nby \u201ctrying to make the divorce easy and seamless, I took on a majority of the debts \nbecause they were debts that I accrued by making upgrades. And I chose to spend that \nmoney, so I took on those debts.\u201d (Tr. at 28.) \nHe lost his job in July 2019 after a dispute over his timecard. He was unemployed \nfor two months before taking an IT position from September 2019 to July 2020 when he \nwas laid off due to the COVID pandemic. He worked for a month as a deli clerk and then \nas a helper for a general contractor four months before returning to the IT field in \nNovember 2020.

Applicant left \nthis apartment in July 2020 after being laid off due to COVID. (Tr, 41-42.) He gave notice \nof his intention to vacate the apartment in June 2020, however the property manager \ncontinued to invoice him $1,400 a month for the next 4 months, which was the end of his \nlease. The property manager did not have a record of the email notice he sent to \nApplicant. The property manager turned the debt over to collection company. He \nacknowledges it is his debt and needs \u201cto pay the debt and clear the debt.\u201d (Tr. 58.) He \nhad tried reaching out about six months ago and creditor suggested a repayment plan of \n6 payments at $950, which was not feasible. He was also told they wanted just under \n$2,000 to set up a payment plan. He intends to contact the collection company again to \nrequest a more reasonable option. (Tr. 53-59; GE 1; Answer; AE T at 7.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: utility account placed for collection in the amount of $1,422. \nApplicant had this account when he lived at the apartment complex alleged in SOR 1.b. \nHe states in his post-hearing statement he turned in his equipment and told them to \nterminate his services. He is attempting to work out the details of a payment plan, he \nestimates it will be about $200. He acknowledged in his testimony he had mixed up the \naccounts. He had provided a 2015 statement for an earlier account that showed he had \npaid that account. (Tr. at 59-60, 82; GE 2; AE L; AE T at 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: utility account placed for collection in the amount of $158. \nApplicant testified that this debt \u201cshould be paid. It was one of [the] small debts for the \nutilities at the apartment that [he] was at.\u201d (Tr. at 61.) He estimated he paid it about six \nmonths after he stopped living there. GE 2 showed the debt as unpaid. (Tr. at 62.) He \nstated he would reach out to the utility to get proof. (Tr. at 62.) No documents were \nreceived. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: residential account placed for collection for $3,491. \nWhen \nApplicant lost his job in July 2019, he could no longer afford the rent and made the \ndecision to break his lease. His rent at the time was $1950. He was required to pay 1\u00bd \nmonths\u2019 rent for breaking the lease. He testified he tried reaching out to the creditor, but \nthey wanted a large downpayment to start a payment plan. The last contact was about \nsix months prior to the hearing. (Tr. at 53-56.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: delinquent medical debt for $255. The debt became delinquent in \nNovember 2018. Applicant testified the debt should have been paid off. He paid it with his \ndebit card and stated he was told a letter would be sent to him. As of the hearing he had \nhad not seen a letter from the creditor. He learned of the debt when he pulled his credit \nreport for his security team.

Applicant\u2019s military \nunit, after a two-week training exercise, was delayed in processing his travel claim. When \nhe received the money, he needed the \u201cmoney for something else\u201d and when it was \ndeposited into his personal account, he used it for something else. (Tr. at 64.) The account \nbecame delinquent in 2012. It was 2018 before he was able to resolve this debt. The \nSeptember 2021 credit report shows the debt as a charge off. (Tr. at 66; GE 4 at 5.) He \noffered AE A, dated December 5, 2018, and AE T, both of which state this credit card \naccount has been \u201cpaid\u201d according to these credit reports. (AE T at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: account placed for collection for $1,948. Applicant used a store \ncredit card to purchase jewelry. With his Answer he provided documentation he had \nreduced the debt to $479. (AE E.) He testified he was able to settle the account for $300 \nand could provide proof of the payment. (Tr. at 67.) The balance on the account supported \nhis testimony he had been making payments to the point where he could settle it. (Tr. at \n68, 88.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: indebted to his state comptroller for a tax lien entered against him \nin 2019 for $2,285.75. The tax lien is for 2017. Applicant filed his taxes himself and made  \na clerical error, which resulted in him being the assessed additional taxes. He testified \nthat about a month prior to the hearing he had received documentation from the \ncomptroller indicating the debt was still outstanding. He has not been able to set up \npayments because he cannot meet the minimum payment of $800. (Tr. at 69.) He was \nfamiliar with the process because the comptroller had filed a tax lien in 2010 after he filled \nout employment forms incorrectly. He provided a release of tax lien to show he had \nsatisfied the 2010 tax judgment. (Tr. at 71; AE B.)  \nApplicant testified he had been filing his Federal and state taxes on time for \u201cthe \nlast couple of years.\u201d In 2017 and 2018, he acknowledged he was \u201cabout a year behind \non filing [his] taxes.\u201d (Tr. at 72.) I will consider this testimony within my whole person \nanalysis. Since his initial mistake in 2010 he has made sure he does not end up owing \nmoney, or as little as possible, by having an additional amount taken from his check and \nclaiming single on his W-4. (Tr. at 72.) He resolved a loan from his 401k, which had been \nused to keep his vehicle running. (AE M.) He is current on the credit card he currently \nmaintains for his personal use. (AE T at 3.) He paid an earlier car loan in September \n2018. (AE T at 6.) He offered other credit items showing he had maintained his finances \nprior to his divorce by paying off his credit card and an automobile loan. (AE T at 8, 9.) \nHis current credit score is Fair.

Applicant credibly testified regarding \nhis thought process and in his post hearing response further explains that thought process \nas it relates to each SOR allegation. Regarding SOR \u00b6 1.a, he received the truck back \nafter only one day of repossession and did not consider this as a repossession. He also \nwas never more than 60 days behind on his payments and for those reasons he did not \nreport the debt on the SCA. For SOR \u00b6 1.b, he stated the debt was sold and he did not \nfollow up appropriately and forgot about the debt. Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.c, because he had \nreceived a letter from the telecommunication company saying that they were making \namendments to his credit report and he did not fully \u201cabsorb\u201d the SCA instructions, or he \nwould have reported this debt as having been in collections with a status of paid off. As \nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f, he was unaware of these medical debts until receiving the SOR. \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.e, he did not follow up with the leasing office and forgot about the debt. He \nexplained he had paid the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i debts in full and did not \u201cabsorb\u201d the \nSCA instructions requiring him to report these debts. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: You answered \u201cNo\u201d to having a lien placed against your property \nfor failing to pay taxes or other debts and thereby deliberately failed to disclose \nthat information as set forth in subparagraph 1.i above. He acknowledges in his \ntestimony and response he should have answered yes. He had provided an earlier \nresolved lien with his Answer. After receiving the SOR and after conducting a detailed \nreview of Section 26 of the SCA he has a better understanding of what should have been \nreported in this section. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: In July 2019, [your company] terminated you for falsifying your \ntimecard. Applicant denies the allegation. He was never counseled on his support to his \nclients. There was a dispute as whether he needed to be in one place at one time, all the \ntime, even though he did report to multiple different locations. The login information did \nnot always capture whether an employee was online. One his colleagues was the one \nthat was reporting whether he was online and physically at the secured location almost \nevery day and he had filed complaints against them. The various emails he submitted \nshowed a strained relationship between him and his supervisors and difficulties of him \nworking offsite, in a secured facility that his supervisor could not access, and the issues \nwith the network. He acknowledged taking long lunches or leaving early and not making \nup the time.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are not fully applicable. Applicant's financial difficulties were \nincurred in part as result of his 2018 divorce, which was a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. After his termination, he worked in the IT field but then experienced a layoff and \nunderemployment, which were not directly related to his termination. His 2020 residential \ndebt is related to being laid off due to COVID. He has resolved some of his SOR debts \nand other debts not alleged in the SOR. His automobile loan debt and credit card debt \nare resolved, and he has substantially reduced the balance on the store credit card. He \nhas four large debts that remain outstanding, two residential debts, the tax lien, and the \nutility account, upon which he has not made any payments.

Sep. 21, 2009). He did not establish that he has made \na good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege whether he deliberately failed to disclose the information \nset forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.i and 1.i respectively. Applicant admits he did not disclose the \ndebts and said he mistakenly failed to disclose these debts on his SCA in his testimony \nand statement. Based on his credible testimony and statement detailing each allegation I \nam not convinced he deliberately omitted, concealed, or falsified of relevant facts from \nhis SCA. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.d allege Applicant\u2019s handling of his finances and work conduct \nconcerning his timecard, which have raised questions regarding his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. SOR \u00b6 \n2.a is not improperly pled under Guideline E, because as 16(d), specifically states \n\u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline.\u201d \nThese debts were addressed in Guideline F. The record supports that he was terminated \nfor timecard fraud.  AG \u00b6 16(d) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.d.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nThe mitigating conditions are established for both allegations. I am satisfied that \nalthough Applicant\u2019s termination for timecard fraud is serious, he has acknowledged his \nrole in the event, which included taking long lunches and leaving early. He documented \nthe issues in the workplace with his supervisor that created a difficult work environment \nand the specific issues surrounding his workplace, which contributed to his termination. \nHe credibly testified he has taken steps to ensure that he does not face a similar situation \nin the future. His current employment reflects his understanding of his responsibilities. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n   \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and has mitigated \nthe concerns raised under personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried \nhis burden of showing that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:     \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.g, 1.h: \n     Subparagraphs 1.b-1.f, 1.i: \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:     \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n     Subparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He received an associate degree from a technical \ninstitute in July 2008. He has never married and has no children. \nApplicant worked in non-federal jobs after receiving his associate degree until he \nwas hired by a federal contractor in July 2009. He received a security clearance in June \n2009. From August 2009 to August 2012, he was assigned to duties as a contractor \nemployee with U.S. Marines in an overseas location. While assigned to duty with the \nMarines, he was reprimanded by his civilian employer for his conduct on one occasion. \nThe record does not reflect the conduct for which he was reprimanded. After his \nemployer\u2019s contract ended in August 2012, he worked for other federal contractors. At the \ntime he submitted his SCA, he had been working for a federal contractor since October \n2017. He was terminated from this employment in August 2018 for reasons set out in the \nSOR, and he was hired by his current employer shortly thereafter. \nApplicant\u2019s job description while working for his former employer as the senior \nsystems administrator made him responsible for \u201censuring the reliable operation of IT \nsystems.\u201d His specific duties and responsibilities included providing server management \nof classified and unclassified networks; providing configuration, support, maintenance, \nand troubleshooting of systems, servers, and desktops; and establishing scripts to \nautomate the team\u2019s infrastructure task, patching, and other operations duties. (GX- 3 at \n20) \nApplicant testified that his first year with his former employer went well, but after \nthe leadership changed, several employees were replaced with outsiders who had \nworked for the new leadership. Because he did not believe that the new leadership \nunderstood the requirements of his job, he began searching for a new job. He accepted \nan offer from his current employer while still working for his former employer. (Tr. 15-16) \nApplicant testified that on August 20, 2018, while he was still employed by his \nformer employer, he was verbally informed by his immediate supervisor that he was being \nterminated because of his \u201chostile behavior\u201d toward a senior executive of the company at \na meeting two days earlier, by removing his glasses and rubbing his forehead while the \nsenior executive was speaking.

(AX F at 4) \nOn August 23, 2018, Applicant\u2019s supervisor sent him an email alleging eight \nconcerns that had arisen since April 2018 and were the basis for his termination. Applicant \ntestified that he did not receive this email, which was sent to his father\u2019s email address. \n(GX 3 at 2; Tr. 24) Five concerns were incorporated into SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, alleging \nconcerns under Guideline K.

There is no evidence that the concerns were investigated before the email \nwas sent to Applicant. The concerns were described in general terms in the email, and \nthe SOR allegations incorporating them did not meet the specificity required by Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.3 (SOR shall be a detailed and comprehensive as the national security permits). \nThe evidence pertaining to the allegations in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Security threats (attempting to access systems without clearance \n(Concern #1).

The record contains no evidence \nof instances when Applicant performed systems scans that were not within his assigned \nduties. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Attempting to secure an administrator account for network \ndevices without a top secret clearance (Concern #5). Applicant testified that he had \nno memory of requesting an administrator account for himself. He believed that he had \nall the access he needed to perform his job. (Tr. 31) In response to DOHA interrogatories, \nhe stated that the only times he submitted requests for new administrative accounts was \nfor new administrators joining the program. These requests were part of his duties as a \nsenior administrator. (GX 3 at 3, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Bringing a personal CD-ROM into the secure workplace (Concern \n#6). Applicant admitted this allegation. He testified that he had a personal CD-ROM in his \ngym bag, and he had forgotten that it was in his gym bag when he came to work. As soon \nas he discovered it, he turned it in to his supervisor, because he knew that bringing it into \nthe workplace was a violation of his employer\u2019s rules. (Tr. 28-29) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Returning to the secure office environment after hours for a not \nverifiable or reasonable purpose (Concern #3). Applicant admitted returning to the \noffice after hours for non-work purposes.

When \nApplicant was questioned by a security investigator about disruptive behavior at work, he \ndisclosed one occasion involving an exchange of words with a coworker about how to do \na job. He considered it to be no more than a disagreement. (GX 3 at 13) The only evidence \nof \u201caggressive behavior\u201d was the accusation of his supervisor that he engaged in \naggressive behavior by removing his glasses and rubbing his head while a senior \nexecutive was speaking at a meeting. (Tr. 22) There is no evidence of the attire and \nappearance requirements for his job and no evidence that he was warned about \ninappropriate attire. To the contrary, a co-worker submitted a statement that Applicant \nalways wore appropriate attire and that he wore a shirt and tie every day even though \nbusiness casual was the norm. (AX A) \nTwo senior systems engineers employed by Applicant\u2019s former employer \nsubmitted statements rebutting the eight concerns about Applicant. One of them stated \nthat if he had any doubts about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and professional behavior, he \nwould not have submitted his statement of support. (AX A; AX B) \nApplicant testified that his overseas service with the Marine Corps was stressful. \nIn addition, his partner passed away in 2013. He believed that he was diagnosed by a \npsychiatrist with post-traumatic stress disorder. He is currently taking medication for \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. (Tr. 35-38) \nApplicant is highly regarded by his current employer.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline K (Handling Protected Information) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information--which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information--raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are not supported by the evidence in \nthe record. However, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are supported by the record \nand are sufficient to establish the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 34(g): \u201cany failure to \ncomply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive information.\u201d Applicant \nadmitted that he violated the rules by bringing a personal CD-ROM into a protected area \nand that he sometimes returned to his secure work area for no purpose except personal \nconvenience. \nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 35(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 35(d): the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. More than five years have elapsed. The \nincident with the CD-ROM was inadvertent and promptly reported. Neither incident is \nlikely to recur. The evidence does not suggest a pattern of security violations. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe concern under this Guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation.

This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 40(a): unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \nAG \u00b6 40(b): unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of, or \ndenial of access to, an information technology system or any data in such \na system; \nAG \u00b6 40(c): use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized \naccess to another system or to a compartmented area within the same \nsystem; \nAG \u00b6 40(d): downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, \nproprietary, or other protected information on or to any unauthorized \ninformation technology system; \nAG \u00b6 40(e): unauthorized use of any information technology system; \nAG \u00b6 40(f): introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, \nsoftware, or media to or from any information technology system when \nprohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when \notherwise not authorized; \nAG \u00b6 40(g): negligence or lax security practices in handling information \ntechnology that persists despite counseling by management; and \nAG \u00b6 40(h): any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or \nnegligent, that results in damage to the national security. \nThere is no evidence in the record establishing AG \u00b6 40(a) through 40(f) and 40(h). \nAG \u00b6 40(g) is partially established by Applicant\u2019s introduction of a personal CD-ROM into \na secure workplace and his off-duty presence in a secure work area for personal \nconvenience, but there is no evidence that he did so after being counseled by \nmanagement. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant was terminated as a consequence of the conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, but it does not allege any additional conduct. The security \nsignificance of his termination is discussed below under Guideline E. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment because of the \neight concerns in his former employer\u2019s August 2018 email. The security concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; [or] (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s minor security violations fall under \nGuidelines K and M, but when considered as a whole, they do not support a whole-person \nassessment of characteristics indicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is partially established. Most of the conduct alleged and established by \nthe evidence is explicitly covered by other guidelines. The evidence is insufficient to \nestablish a pattern of rule violations. There is no evidence of aggressive or disruptive \nbehavior covered by AG \u00b6 16(d)(3). The evidence is sufficient to establish that Applicant \ntook off his glasses and rubbed his head while a senior executive was speaking. As such, \nthis conduct falls short of being aggressive. However, the evidence is sufficient to \nestablish inappropriate behavior under AG \u00b6 16(d)(2). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating condition under this guideline is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThis mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s conduct was minor, infrequent, \nand happened more than four years ago. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline K, M, and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines K, M, \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that \nthe evidence fails to establish the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a, and \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his minor security violations \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e and the inappropriate behavior and termination of \nemployment alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K, (Handling Protected Information): FOR APPLICANT, \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M (Use of Information Technology): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 38 years old, married to his second wife, and has two minor children with his first wife. He served in the United States Army from 2004 to 2010, receiving an honorable discharge. He has a master\u2019s degree. He has been employed by a defense contractor since July 2020, and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 15, 17, and 18; Applicant Exhibit B.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR stated that Applicant had six debts that were past due, charged off, or in collection, in the total amount of approximately $56,041. In his Answer he admitted allegations 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, with explanations. He denied allegations 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, stating he had resolved those debts. The existence and amount of these debts is supported by his admissions to three SOR allegations in his Answer and by credit reports dated June 25, 2020; January 7, 2021; January 19, 2022; and May 11, 2023.

On April 17, 2023, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services \n(DCSA CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nafter June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on May 12, 2023, with one \nattachment. (Credit report dated May 11, 2023. Answer Attachment). He also requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non June 26, 2023. The case was assigned to me on June 29, 2023. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on July 10, 2023. The case \nwas heard on August 28, 2023. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nSeptember 8, 2023. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits \nA and B, which were also admitted without objection. He asked that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant submitted three exhibits on \nSeptember 7, 2023, which identified as Applicant Exhibits A, B, and C. For ease of \ndiscussion they are hereby lettered Applicant Exhibits C, D, and E, respectively. Applicant \nsubmitted an additional exhibit on September 29, 2023, which he again identified as \nApplicant Exhibit A. For ease of discussion it is hereby lettered Applicant Exhibit F. All the \ndocuments were admitted without objection, and the record closed on September 29, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 38 years old, married to his second wife, and has two minor children \nwith his first wife. He served in the United States Army from 2004 to 2010, receiving an \nhonorable discharge. He has a master\u2019s degree. He has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since July 2020, and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security \nclearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, \n15, 17, and 18; Applicant Exhibit B.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR stated that Applicant had six debts that were past due, charged off, or in \ncollection, in the total amount of approximately $56,041. In his Answer he admitted \nallegations 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, with explanations. He denied allegations 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, \nstating he had resolved those debts. The existence and amount of these debts is \nsupported by his admissions to three SOR allegations in his Answer and by credit reports \ndated June 25, 2020; January 7, 2021; January 19, 2022; and May 11, 2023. \n(Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6; Answer Attachment.) They are also confirmed by \nApplicant\u2019s answers during an interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) that was held on January 21, 2021.

(Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant testified that most of his financial difficulties resulted from his first \nmarriage and eventual divorce. While they were married, he was able to maintain \npayments on all their debts. When they were divorced, he assumed all their marital debt \nand a large child-support payment. The delinquent debt situation came to a head in \napproximately 2020. (Tr. 21-24.) \nStarting in 2020 and continuing to present Applicant has been paying many of his \ndelinquent debts. This is reflected in the most recent of the credit reports in the record. \nHe stated, \u201cI tried to just do one [debt] at a time, just knock them out. . . . So, really just \nchipping away a little bit at a time, I think that really helped me close out the majority of \nthese debts. (Government Exhibit 6; Answer Attachment; Tr. 27.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted owing $17,339 for a charged-off debt. He testified that, at \nthe time of the hearing this debt, and the one set out in allegation 1.b, below, were the \nonly delinquent debts he still had outstanding. He further stated that after completing \npayments on 1.b, which he has now successfully done, he would work diligently to resolve \nthis debt as well. However, as of the time the record closed, this debt had not been \nresolved. (Tr. 28-29.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing $13,523 for a charged-off credit card debt. He \ntestified that he had been working with the creditor to resolve the debt. Subsequent to the \nhearing he supplied a document from the creditor dated September 29, 2023, stating the \ndebt had been \u201csuccessfully settled.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 29-30.) This debt has been \nresolved. \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing a charged-off debt to a creditor in the amount of \n$10,199. He testified and supplied documentation showing that he had resolved the debt \nbefore the hearing. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 31.) This debt has been resolved. \n1.d. Applicant denied owing a creditor $6,483 for a charged-off account. He stated \nthat he had paid this debt and knew of no reason why it still appeared on his 2020 credit \nreport. (Government Exhibit 4; Tr. 32-34.) This debt does not appear on any of the more \nrecent credit reports in the record. (Government Exhibits 5 and 6; Answer Attachment.) \nAs set forth elsewhere in this decision, Applicant\u2019s statements about payments to other \ncreditors are supported by documentation. That fact, along with evidence showing he had \nsuccessfully paid additional past-due debts not alleged in the SOR, provide support for \nhis statement that he paid this debt as well. Based on the state of the record, I find by a \npreponderance of the evidence Applicant resolved this former debt. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.e.

Subsequent to the hearing he submitted a document from the \ncreditor confirming that he had resolved this debt. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 35.) This debt \nhas been resolved. \n \n1.f. Applicant denied owing $3,042 for a past-due debt. He stated that he had \nsuccessfully paid this debt. Subsequent to the hearing he submitted a document from the \ncreditor confirming that he had resolved the debt. (Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 35.) This debt \nhas been resolved. \nMitigation \nApplicant supplied a letter of recommendation from the vice president of operations \nat his employer. The writer stated that during the time Applicant has worked for him, \n\u201c[Applicant] has consistently been evaluated above his peers and exceeded \nexpectations.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit E.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had incurred approximately $56,000 in past-due indebtedness over the \nlast several years. The debts were unresolved at the time the SOR was issued. These \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe evidence establishes that all the above mitigating conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s debt situation. His divorce had a deleterious impact on his finances, but he \nhas worked hard to resolve the resulting issues. He has paid five of the six past-due debts \nthat are of concern to the Government. One debt, 1.a, remained unresolved. However, \nApplicant showed a sustained track record of making payments towards his other past-\ndue debts in fulfillment of payment arrangements. Under the circumstances of this case, \nthat evidence supports a finding that Applicant can be relied upon to resolve the remaining \ndebt, if he has not already done so. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No.\n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that \nhe has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is \nthat an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at a \ntime.

The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns over his past-due indebtedness. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or \nduress has been eliminated. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial \ndoubt as to his suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

The delinquent accounts are credit cards, department store accounts, an electronic store account, a signature loan and personal loans, and an eviction. The total amount of debt is approximately $50,765. The debts became delinquent between February 2011 and August 2021. Applicant admitted all listed delinquent debts except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.l.

Eligibility for security clearance access is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 16, 2022, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On April 18, 2022, he provided an interview (PSI) with an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services \n(CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required for security clearance eligibility, \nand issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 1, 2022, \ndetailing security concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline F). The action \nwas taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided his answer on March 5, 2023. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 12, 2024, for a \nhearing on March 27, 2024. The hearing was held by Teams video teleconference as \nscheduled. The Government\u2019s seven exhibits were entered into evidence over \nApplicant\u2019s objection. Applicant presented no exhibits at the hearing. On April 11, 2024, \nDepartment Counsel had no objections to Applicant\u2019s 16 post-hearing exhibits. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on April 4, 2024. \nRulings on Procedure \nAs the Teams hearing was about to begin, Applicant discovered that he could not \nactivate his video for the Teams hearing. I asked him whether he understood that the \nhearing would proceed by audio only. He indicated that he agreed to continue the \nhearing with only audio. (Tr. 4-5) \nAt different points in the hearing, Applicant stated that he might need an \nattorney because he did not fully understand some of the exhibits or words in the \nexhibits. (Tr. 35) After some discussion, I advised him to examine the discovery letter \nthat Department Counsel sent him on March 23, 2023, more than a year before the \nMarch 2024 hearing. I briefly reviewed the contents of the letter with him and inquired \nwhy he waited a year to ask the questions about the exhibits and other questions \nregarding the security clearance investigation process. As to GE 1, Applicant indicated \nhe did not understand some of the words in the exhibit, and he did not get the expected \nhelp in completing the application as he had in the past. I overruled his objections to GE \n1 because he signed and certified the exhibit, and had filled out security clearance \napplications in the past. (Tr. 36-42) \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s April 2022 PSI (GE 2), he testified that he did not \nunderstand parts of the exhibit. Department Counsel asserted that the exhibit be \nadmitted into evidence because it was relevant to the issues in the case. I overruled \nApplicant\u2019s objections because he waited until the March 2024 hearing to ask questions \nabout the exhibit or make clarifications to the exhibit. I note that the PSI contains \ndelinquent debt information that is favorable to Applicant, including credible reasons for \nhis financial troubles. (Tr. 42-46) See GE 2 at 4. \nApplicant objected to GE 3 because it was not a current credit report that \nshowed he paid off certain listed debts. I noted that changes in more recent credit \nreports showing that delinquent debts were paid could portray an improved financial \npicture. I explained to him that even though the dated credit report did not contain \ncurrent account information, that does not preclude the admissibility of the exhibit. I \nadmitted GE 3 into evidence. Applicant objected to GE 4 for the same reason as GE 3, \nand I admitted GE 4 into evidence for the same reason.

GE 7 is admitted into evidence. (Tr. 48-50) Considering Applicant\u2019s \nyear-long delay in presenting questions concerning the exhibits and other phases of the \nsecurity clearance process, and having filled out security clearance applications in past, \nI am denying Applicant\u2019s wavering request for an attorney because he never made a \nspecific request for an attorney. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR lists 13 delinquent accounts, two judgments, and one landlord-tenant \neviction action. The delinquent accounts are credit cards, department store accounts, \nan electronic store account, a signature loan and personal loans, and an eviction. The \ntotal amount of debt is approximately $50,765. The debts became delinquent between \nFebruary 2011 and August 2021. Applicant admitted all listed delinquent debts except \nfor SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.l. The Government\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBRs) at GE 3 and 4, \nand judgments (GE 5, 6, 7) confirm his admissions. \nApplicant explained in his April 2022 PSI that his financial problems were \ncaused by loss of work during COVID-19 pandemic. (circa March 2020 to late 2022), \nand the approximate $15,000 cost to transport his brother back to their home country. \n(GE 2 at 4) Applicant stressed that he paid or settled the majority of the listed debts. He \nfiled disputes of one or two delinquent accounts. of certain debts. (March 2023 answer \nto SOR; AE 2 at 4; Tr. 21) \nApplicant is 51 years old. He married in February 2009 and separated in June \n2018. He has four children ages 6, 14, 16, and 21. (Tr. 50) He has been employed as a \nsecurity officer by two security contractors, one from 2019 to the present, and one from \nMay 2016 to the present. From January 2014 to June 2016, he was a security officer \nemployed by two different security companies for different periods of time. From \nFebruary 2012 to January 2014, his February 2022 e-QIP furnishes no information \nabout his employment status. He took a trip and spent 21 to 30 days in his country of \nbirth in April 2012 and September 2013. (GE 1 at 44-45) This gap in his employment is \npreceded by working as a security officer from September 2011 to February 2012, when \nhe was terminated for sleeping on the job. Before his long career as a security officer, \nhe was a custodian for a school system. (GE 1 at 11-24) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 This account was a loan from a credit union. The account was \ncharged off between 2012 and 2016 while Applicant was working for his employer \nidentified in his April 2022 PSI. (GE 1 at 13; GE 2 at 2; GE 4 at 5) His explanation was \nthat his security clearance had expired at some time during the period, and he was \nwaiting for the clearance to be updated. Though he claimed he obtained insurance to \ncover this account and the one identified in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he provided no additional \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation regarding the insurance.

(AE 1A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 This account was a loan from the same credit union identified in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a that became delinquent in July 2013. (GE 2 at 2; GE 4 at 4) On October 4, \n2022, the credit union confirmed a settlement arrangement calling for Applicant to pay \n$150 a month starting on October 17, 2022, with subsequent payments every 30 days. \nThe payment history reflects that Applicant has made 19 monthly payments on the SOR \n\u00b6 1.b account from October 2022 through March 2024. (Tr. 61-64; AE 1B, settlement \nletter and payment ledger) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 This credit-card account became delinquent in May 2017, and \ncharged to profit and loss. (GE 3 at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 This was a signature loan that Applicant opened in April 2010 with \nthe same credit union identified in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The last date of payment activity was in \nJuly 2016. (GE 4 at 5) \nIn his April 2022 PSI, Applicant claimed he also had insurance on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.d. He indicated that he was unable to make payments while he was waiting for his \nsecurity clearance to be renewed, presumably during the period 2012 to 2016 as he \nexplained under SOR \u00b6 1.a above. (GE 2 at 3) \nThe subsequent court action filed by the credit union was dismissed because \nthe collection agency and Applicant reached a settlement in February 2018. (AE 1C/1D) \nThough he agreed to a repayment plan of $125 a month, before he could begin monthly \npayments, the Government shutdown in 2018. (GE 2 at 3) (Internet research reflects \nthat the shutdown occurred between late December 2018 to late January 2019.) \nApplicant\u2019s documentation reveals that he made regular monthly payments to \nthe collection agency for the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d accounts from February 2018 to \nDecember 2018. He stopped payments until January 2023, when he resumed his \nmonthly payments because he could not afford the higher amount. The payment \nstatement shows that Applicant\u2019s most recent monthly payment was $250 in March \n2024. He has made a total of 24 monthly payments since February 2018. (Tr. 67-70; AE \n1C/1D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 This account and the one listed at SOR \u00b6 1.m are the same \naccount. The amount in each allegation is the same. The account number in Applicant\u2019s \nApril 2022 PSI matches the account number in the SOR. The SOR \u00b6 1.e account was a \nstore credit card that became delinquent in August 2017.

He was evicted from his \napartment and the landlord charged him over $900 in damages that he did not feel he \nowed. On October 11, 2022, the collection agency representing the apartment, notified \nhim that his full payment of the damage claim closed his account.

Applicant \ndid not know why the account was being listed as delinquent because someone \nretrieved the cable equipment before he was evicted. The documentation shows that he \nwas evicted in about June 2019. On April 9, 2024, Applicant claimed the account was \nsettled for $432. Without independent evidence of his claim, I am unable to accept this \ndocument (AE 1I).

(Tr. 106-117) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence reveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. Mismanaging \nhis personal finances raises a disqualifying possibility that he may exhibit the same \napproach toward safeguarding classified information.  \nAdverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s \nobligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The \nGovernment credit reports (GE 3, and 4) establish that the debts listed in the SOR have \nbeen delinquent since between February 2011 and August 2021. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply because all the listed debts became delinquent and languished in delinquency for \nsignificant periods. I conclude that AG \u00b6 19(b) does not apply because I believe \nApplicant has demonstrated that he wants to satisfy his delinquent debts, but several \ntumultuous events occurred to stifle his efforts. First, he lost work during the time (2012-\n2016) he was waiting for his security clearance to be renewed. Second, in 2019, he had \nto pay over $15,000 to transport his brother back to an African country for burial. Third, \nhe lost more work during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022.  \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) has limited application due to the lengthy periods which most of the \nlisted debts were delinquent. The debts occurred under circumstances that could recur \ndue to the lack of financial counseling and other financial tools to successfully manage \nhis finances, thus casting continuing doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability and good judgment. \nThe three events discussed above were unforeseen and beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol. The loss of work because his security clearance expired, experiencing an \nunexpected death of a brother, then spending more than $15,000 to transport his \nbrother for an overseas funeral, and then confronting additional loss of work due to the \nCovid-19 pandemic, entitle Applicant to substantial mitigation under the first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b). \nThough three of the creditors or collection agencies had to file civil actions \nbefore Applicant initiated action, and he did not pay off or settle other accounts until \nafter he received the SOR, he furnished a documented record of 24 payments to the \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d began in February 2018. \nApplicant provided documentation showing that he settled the SOR \u00b6 1.a \naccount in October 2022. Regarding the SOR \u00b6 1.b account, he negotiated a settlement \nin October 2022, and has provided documentation of monthly payments from October \n2022 to March 2024. In sum, based on his documented record of payments to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b, Applicant receives some mitigation for acting responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He also is entitled to mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) for negotiating \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsettlements with several of the creditors or collection agencies, while complying with the \npayment plans in a good-faith manner with other creditors. While there is no \nindependent evidence of resolution of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.l, the debts do not detract from \nApplicant\u2019s good-faith efforts in resolving all the other listed debts in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s use of only one credit card to limit his spending is not the most \neffective way of monitoring and managing his finances. A written budget gives an \napplicant an opportunity to determine where he is spending his money and avenues to \nreduce spending in those areas. Another way of curbing spending is to rely on cash \nwhich can curtail the impulse to overspend. Should Applicant continue to handle his \nfinances as he has done in the past, he will likely invite future financial problems that will \nput his security clearance eligibility in jeopardy. Applicant is entitled to limited mitigation \nunder the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(c) for resolving his debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has four children. He has been employed as a security officer since \nJanuary 2014. \nApplicant had three major events in his life that resulted in financial problems. \nThe events substantially extenuate his overdue action in addressing the delinquent \ndebts. However, the record demonstrates that he began resolving several of the debts \nat least two years before he received the SOR. His track record of payments to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b,1.c, and 1.d collection agencies establishes persuasive evidence that he intends to \nsatisfy all his debts. In Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held \nthat, to establish his case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt reduction.

See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant \nhas demonstrated consistency in repaying his debts, and has he been truthful about the \naction he has taken to pay his past due debts. Judging by the totality of the entire record \nunder the specific conditions and general conditions of the whole-person concept, \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns generated by the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant fell behind on her debts after she dropped out of college in 2017 and \nworked minimum wage jobs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant used federal student loans to finance her college education. She fell \nbehind on those debts, and others, after she dropped out of college in 2017.For a time, \nshe lived in an apartment complex that had unsafe living conditions. Some debts remain \nfrom both her difficult pregnancy and her difficult living circumstances. She held several \nminimum-wage or low-paying jobs until she was hired by her current employer. Most of \nher debts, particularly her student loans, are ongoing, so AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are due to circumstances beyond her control, including limited \nincome before her current job. She has made an effort to limit her expenses by moving in \nwith her mother several years ago. She has also not incurred new debts. Her federal \nstudent loans were in deferment during the pandemic, and she has applied for the \u201cFresh \nStart Initiative\u201d program to bring her loans current, and she plans to address them through \nan income-driven plan. This will take time, as she recognizes. However, despite their \nsympathetic origins, Applicant took little action before late 2023 to address her debts. She \nneeds to establish a track record of payments towards her debts to show good faith and \nresponsible action to mitigate the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) \ntherefore do not fully apply to mitigate security concerns about her finances. \nApplicant is disputing several debts with the credit bureaus, but she did not provide \nsufficient documentation to substantiate that these debts are either paid, resolved, or no \nlonger valid. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not fully established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant is well-regarded at work, and she has received awards and \ncertificates for her accomplishments. \nNevertheless, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcern shown by her delinquent debts. This is not to say she will not be able to establish \nher eligibility at a future date. But she needs to establish a reasonable plan for addressing \nher debts and make some concrete steps putting that plan into place. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor working in a rather \nhigh level of the federal government. She has been serving as an executive assistant with \nher current employer since about January 2022.

She has never served with the U.S. military. She was granted \na secret clearance in 2019. She has never been married and has no biological children. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nApplicant grew up in a household where both parents were substance abusers, \nand the house was littered with burnt pipes and baggies.

Child Protective Services (CPS) eventually removed her from \nthat environment until she was 10 or 11 years old and placed her with her grandmother \nuntil she turned 18. Applicant\u2019s father passed away from a drug overdose when Applicant \nwas about 12 years old. Because her mother has been in rehabilitation, safe houses, and \nsobriety throughout the past 20 years, Applicant and her mother have attended Narcotics \nAnonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as well as a convention. (Tr. \nat 146-147) \nDespite attending NA and AA meetings over the years (Tr. at 151-152), Applicant \nbecame a social and recreational multi-substance abuser whose substances of choice \nduring a five-year period were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana \u2013 a \nSchedule I Controlled Substance; cannabidiol (CBD) \u2013 either derived from THC, the hemp \nplant, or manufactured in a laboratory, and may be legal or illegal depending on its source; \nlysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance; and cocaine \u2013 a \nSchedule \nII \nControlled \nSubstance. \n(https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-\nscheduling) \nOn two occasions during December 2015 until some date in 2016, Applicant \nattended fraternity parties with friends. Cocaine was commonly used among her group of \nfriends, and succumbing to peer pressure, she experimented by inhaling cocaine \u2013 \nprovided to her but not purchased by her \u2013 through her nose. She recalled being nervous \nand sweaty but was unable to determine if those effects were due to her anxiety over \nusing the substance or because of the substance itself. Applicant claims to be \nembarrassed and ashamed over her cocaine experimentation and does not intend to use \nit again. (GE 1 at 35-36; GE 3 at 12; Tr. at 98-100, 125-129) \nIn December 2015, Applicant started smoking marijuana sporadically with her \n\u201cfriend group.\u201d In March 2016, her frequency of use increased to weekly, and that \nfrequency continued \u2013 smoking about one to three grams per week \u2013 until December \n2016. Her \u201cfriend group\u201d pooled funds to give to one particular member of the group, who \nwould purchase it. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was initially calming, but over time she \nbegan to experience weight loss, trouble with sleeping, and anxiety, and noticed that her \ngrades were slipping. She made four or five efforts to stop using marijuana for brief \nperiods, but she generally resumed using it.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n[D]isregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that \nusing these cannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in \naccordance with SEAD 4. Although the passage of the Agricultural \nImprovement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from the definition of marijuana \nwithin the Controlled Substances Act, products containing greater than a \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.3 percent concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a \npsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d \nAccordingly, products labeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than 0.3 \npercent THC continue to meet the legal definition of marijuana, and \ntherefore remain illegal to use under federal law and policy. . . . [T]here is a \nrisk that using these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently high \nlevels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under agency-\nadministered employment or random drug testing programs. Should an \nindividual test positive, they will be subject to an investigation under specific \nguidelines established by their home agency. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f)  any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant was a recreational multi-substance user who admittedly experimented \nwith cocaine by inhaling it on two separate occasions from December 2015 to 2016; and \nexperimented with LSD on one occasion in March 2016. She routinely used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from December 2015 until December 2017. She was granted a \nsecurity clearance in September 2019. Approximately five months later, in February 2020, \nshe consumed a CBD gummy that a friend offered her to reduce her anxiety about skiing. \nApplicant was not sure if the gummy was derived from THC or hemp, and the Government \nis unable to determine the source. AG \u00b6 25(a) has been established, but for reasons \ndescribed below, AG \u00b6 25(f) has not been established. \nApplicant\u2019s ignorance regarding the source of the CBD \u2013 hemp or THC \u2013 and the \nGovernment\u2019s inability to otherwise determine (or allege) that the CBD was THC-derived, \nin the absence of a positive drug test result, severely limits the Government\u2019s ability to \nprove its case with respect to the CBD allegation. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s \nCBD gummy contained THC at any level, and it would require speculation to assume it \ncontained a prohibited amount of THC to do so. It appears that she did not check the CBD \nlabels to determine the source. The facts herein differ substantially from those in ISCR \nCase 22-011476 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2024). In that case the applicant claimed ignorance \nregarding the source of the CBD he used and denied recent use of marijuana. But that \napplicant had a positive drug test, and his credibility was questioned. Here, there was no \nuse of marijuana for over two years or a positive test for the Government to base its \nallegation that the CBD contained \u201can unknown level of THC.\u201d Accordingly, I conclude \nthat the Government failed to meet the necessary evidentiary burden of proof. \nWith respect to the remaining illegal substances that Applicant used (marijuana, \ncocaine, and LSD), the guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that \ncould mitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. Although Applicant grew up in a household where \nboth parents were substance abusers; her father died of a drug overdose; and for many \nyears she and her mother attended NA and AA meetings, when she changed her \nenvironment and went to college, she joined a \u201cfriend group\u201d of drug users. The result \nwas isolated recreational experimentation with cocaine (two times) and LSD (one time), \nand regular use of marijuana. Her last use of any illegal substance took place in \nDecember 2017 \u2013 six years ago, when she was 20 years old. The results of her \nexperimentations were unpleasant. She finally decided that she didn\u2019t want to be like her \nparents, so she stopped. Applicant no longer associates with her friends who were and \nare still drug users. She submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. Applicant claims that she was \nembarrassed by her actions, and she finally acknowledged her drug involvement in 2022. \nShe completed a 16-hour Drug and Alcohol Awareness Class in November 2023. In \nJanuary 2024, she underwent a drug test for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, \nand PCP, and the results were negative for all of those drugs. Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement actions before she was an adult, ending six years ago and followed up by \nabstinence, no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b616: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e) have been established. Applicant\u2019s \u201cyouthful\u201d \nindiscretions in experimenting with, or regularly using, various illegal substances ceased \nin December 2017. In August 2019 \u2013 after about 20 months of drug-free living \u2013 she \nresponded to a simple question in the SF 86: \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally \nused any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d Rather than telling the truth about her drug \nhistory, she deliberately lied and concealed the truth. Omitting or falsifying information to \nimprove one\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or to conceal unfavorable information are \nrelatively common. Mistakes early in life can be forgiven if one has become older and \nwiser, as suggested by her character references, but covering up past mistakes during \nthe security clearance process changes the recency analysis and brings the record of \nunreliable or untrustworthy behavior up to the current time. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct: \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNone of the conditions apply. In this instance, the truth remained hidden from \nAugust 2019 until February 2022, well after Applicant had been granted a security \nclearance based on her earlier false responses in her 2019 SF 86 and subsequent OPM \ninterview of September 2019. Applicant majored in criminal justice in college. Her work \ncolleagues and friends have characterized her with such positive terms as reliable, \ntrustworthy, sound judgment, integrity, and honest. However, as an adult, rather than \nexercising those positive traits when she was faced with a selection as to which fork in \nthe divided road to take, honesty versus dishonesty, she twice chose the latter \u2013 both in \nher SF 86 and during a subsequent OPM interview. \nApplicant has offered several explanations for her deliberate actions: (1) there was \nno paper trail, so her friends and family advised her to lie; (2) she was still unsure of her \nfuture career path; (3) she was embarrassed about her drug use; and (4) she was nervous \nabout completing the form as it was her first time doing so. Another explanation was more \nrecently made to a work colleague: she did not understand the process. In this instance, \nthe truth is straightforward, it does not deviate. But Applicant has chosen to explain \ndifferently why she lied. As Moawad said, \u201cMy destiny will be determined by what I do \nnext.\u201d Unfortunately, Applicant\u2019s next step following her drug involvement was to lie. \nApplicant\u2019s work colleagues seemingly chose to overlook her deliberate omissions, \nfalsifications, and concealments even though she obtained a security clearance because \nof her lies. As noted above, two of her character references are in high level senior \npositions, yet neither of them informally suggested or formally recommended that I follow \nany exception under SEAD 4, App. C, in either granting a waiver or condition to her \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and Guideline E in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in SEAD 4, App. A. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and Guideline E, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant proffered \nsubstantial mitigating evidence, which was more than sufficient to overcome the \ndisqualifying conditions established under Guideline H. Her youthful indiscretions in \nexperimenting with, or regularly using, various illegal substances ceased in December \n2017 \u2013 six years ago \u2013 and she has been abstinent ever since. However, Applicant\u2019s \nmore recent actions under Guideline E raised substantially more serious issues in the \ncontext of the whole person. She lied twice in 2019, while she was about 22 years old, \nleading to her being granted a security clearance and assigned to a sensitive position. \nThe truth was hidden by her, and it went unreported until February 2022, when she was \nabout 25 years old. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her personal \nconduct but has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from her drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Tr. 25,29, 39-42; AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant owed \n$22,265 on four delinquent debts. The following financial considerations disqualifying \ncondition applies: \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of his ability to do so; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant asserts his ex-wife is \nresponsible for certain debts opened in his name during the marriage, specifically SOR \n\u00b6 1.b. However, this assertion is not corroborated by the record. He signed a marital \nsettlement agreement indicating he retained responsibility for all the debts incurred in \nhis name. He has not taken any steps to resolve any of the alleged debts. Although the \namount of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt may be considered low for adults in his age \ngroup, this does not mitigate the alleged security concerns. \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Furthermore, applicants are not held to a \nstandard of perfection. All that is required is that he develop a plan for handling his \ndelinquent accounts and executing that plan. Applicant did not present evidence of his \nplans or efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.oo) Her \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. She was first married from September 1995 to May 2004. \nShe married a second time in December 2014. She has no children, but during the \nhearing she stated that her sister and her two children were temporarily residing with her \nand her husband. Since March 2022, she has worked for a federal contractor as a \ncustomer service representative. Her employment requires that she be granted \ntrustworthiness eligibility for her public trust position. (GE 1; Tr. 15-19) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file her 2020 and 2021 federal income tax \nreturns (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and she failed to file her State X income tax returns for the same \nyears (SOR \u00b6 1.b). At the hearing, Applicant admitted that she has not filed any of her \nfederal or State X income tax returns since 2020 because the tax software requires that \nshe list her income that was reported the previous tax year. She was unable to obtain her \nincome from 2019, and this in turn caused a domino effect which has prevented her from \npreparing any federal or state income tax returns since tax year 2020. She has tried \ncalling the Internal Revenue Service to discuss her problem, but she has been placed on \nhold for hours at a time without connecting with a tax representative. She is aware that \nshe owes $900 for tax year 2020, but she is unable to pay this amount currently.

(Tr. 36-37; AE A) \nPolicies \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may be \nmade. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nConditions that may raise financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed her financial delinquencies to her and her husband\u2019s periods \nof unemployment, and her history of medical issues. All of these circumstances created \na financial hardship, and they were beyond her control. Notwithstanding these events that \nimpacted her finances, Applicant must demonstrate that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant has experienced financial problems since 2018. She has not made any \npayments or initiated communication with any of her delinquent creditors. She has not \nfiled any income tax returns since 2020, and she has not set up a payment plan with a \nstate or federal tax authority to pay back taxes. She has not demonstrated that she acted \nresponsibly to address her financial delinquencies. There are clear indications that her \ndebts are not being resolved and that her finances are not under control. Under all the \ncircumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Applicant did not \nprovide any evidence of payments, payment plans, or other actions to resolve the 39 \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. She has been unable to resolve her unfiled and \nunpaid taxes since tax year 2020. Her actions show a lack of financial responsibility and \ngood judgment and raise unmitigated questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect sensitive information. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nposition of trust. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \ntrustworthiness position is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying \nthe factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under her \ncurrent circumstances, a position of trust is not warranted. In the future, she may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her trustworthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in the Directive, and the AGs, to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that financial \nconsideration concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.oo: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Instead, he sought counseling \nwith a chaplain, often weekly. While on active duty, Applicant served one tour overseas \non an aircraft carrier. He recalled one incident, while he was working radar, where an \naircraft crashed on the deck. He was not responsible for the crash and there was no \nfire, injuries, or fatalities. However, he highlighted this event as a trigger for his ongoing \npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.

He continued to struggle with alcohol and was twice arrested for driving \nwhile intoxicated (DWI): once in 2008 and again in about April 2011. He was found \nguilty on both occasions. In about August 2011 and September 2011, he completed two \nsequential 30-day periods of inpatient alcohol treatment. Afterwards, he attended \ncounseling sessions for about three months but stopped going to counseling after the \ndeath of his alcohol counselor.

In February 2016, he attempted suicide by overdose and was voluntarily \nhospitalized. He was diagnosed with acute depression and bipolar disorder.

As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28 and the following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, \nirresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, \nchronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was twice hospitalized in 2016 and again in 2018 following suicide \nattempts. He acknowledged a history of not attending recommended counseling. Dr. L \nnoted Applicant\u2019s ongoing reluctance to participate in psychotherapy and opined that he \nhad not engaged in sufficient treatment to successfully manage his anxiety and \ndepression symptoms and that he was at risk of psychological decompensation. \nFurther, Dr. L found that Applicant\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness \nwere impaired. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability. \nDating back to at least 1996, Applicant has a long history of mental health \nconcerns. Initially, he struggled with alcoholism along with depression. Although he \nunderwent several rounds of treatment, he experienced two DWIs before sufficiently \naddressing his alcoholism. He has remained sober for over twelve years. \nStill, Applicant\u2019s struggles with anxiety, depression and, later, PTSD continued. \nAlthough he maintained sobriety since 2011, there are multiple instances where he \nrefused to fully commit to a treatment plan for his mental health concerns. Unable to \ncope with multiple stressors, greatest of which was attempting to support his alcoholic \nfather, Applicant attempted suicide on three separate occasions, twice in close proximity \nin 2016, and once in 2018. While he voluntarily participated in treatment after each \nevent, he struggled to continue counseling based on insurance issues and his own \ndoubt as to the benefits of ongoing treatment. \nEven when Applicant started treating with Dr. T consistently in 2020, his rejection \nof psychotherapy and counseling continued. On Dr. T\u2019s recommendation, he attended \npsychotherapy in 2021, but only completed about four visits before stopping treatment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs noted in Dr. L\u2019s March 2022 evaluation, Applicant\u2019s long-term resistance to \npsychological engagement meant that he had historically not participated in sufficient \ntreatment to manage his anxiety and depressive symptoms. \nIn August 2023, Applicant restarted psychotherapy. In October 2023, Dr. T \nprovided a positive assessment of his treatment. His son and friend also testified to his \nimproved condition. However, given the extended period of mental health issues, his \nrecent efforts to fully participate in the treatment recommended by Dr. T is insufficient to \nestablish ongoing and consistent compliance with a treatment plan. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) \nnor 29(b) is applicable. \nAdditionally, while Dr. T\u2019s October 2023 correspondence provides a positive\nassessment of Applicant, she acknowledged that he still experienced exacerbated \nsymptoms and mental health emergencies. Although Dr. T noted that he was \u201cfuture-\noriented\u201d and was not \u201can imminent risk to self or others,\u201d this correspondence and \nApplicant\u2019s recent restart of psychotherapy are insufficient, at this time, to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns relating to psychological conditions. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(c) nor 29(d) is \napplicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility.  \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleges that Applicant used marijuana in \n2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and made deliberate false statements in his July 2021 SCA by failing \nto disclose his history of marijuana use (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and his use of marijuana while \npossessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.c). \nBeginning with an applicant\u2019s responses in the application and continuing \nthrough the investigative phase, \u201cthe security clearance investigation is not a forum for \nan applicant to split hairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a \ncompelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information.\u201d That \ncompelling interest includes the legitimate interest in being able to make sound \ndecisions based on complete and accurate information. An applicant who deliberately \nfails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the Government in connection with a \nsecurity clearance investigation interferes with the integrity of the industrial security \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprogram. ISCR Case No. 01-03132 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) The Government must \nproduce substantial evidence that an omission was deliberate and not merely that the \nomission occurred. ISCR Case No. 07-16511 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009) \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 16 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nInitially, Applicant only disclosed to his medical providers and Dr. L that he used \nmarijuana in 2018. He later testified that he used marijuana from 2015 through 2018. He \nhas since terminated his marijuana use. Nonetheless, his marijuana use in 2018 is \nsufficient to raise concerns over his judgment, trustworthiness, reliability and willingness \nto comply with rules and regulations. He further deliberately failed to provide accurate \ninformation regarding his marijuana use in his SCA over concerns regarding the impact \nto his security clearance. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under AG \u00b6 17 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant testified that he used marijuana from 2015 through 2018 to self-\nmedicate for various symptoms including depression. He admitted that he did not \ndisclose his marijuana use in his SCA and was not candid about his marijuana use to \nhis medical providers out of concern for the impact it would have on his ability to \nmaintain a security clearance. At the hearing, he expressed remorse over his decision \nnot to disclose his marijuana use sooner. He testified that he has not used marijuana \nsince 2018. \nApplicant failed to make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the record by \nproviding an accurate history of his marijuana use during the security investigation \nprocess or to his medical providers. He did not meet his burden of mitigation. This \ninvolved a significant matter of his past and continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) nor 17(c) is applicable. \nApplicant fully acknowledged his error in failing to disclose his marijuana use \nduring the security investigation. He has since found other means to address his \nsymptoms and is working toward alleviating the stressors, circumstances and factors \nthat initially led to his marijuana use. However, these efforts are insufficient to mitigate \nhis falsifications about his marijuana use on his SCA. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) nor 17(e) is \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline I and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant overcame a history of alcoholism and has made progress toward \naccepting and maintaining a complete treatment plan to address his mental health \nconcerns. Additionally, he honorably served in the Navy and has been a valued \nemployee of his company for nearly twenty years. He has held a security clearance for \nnearly thirty years. \nNonetheless, Applicant\u2019s acceptance and participation in the full treatment \nrecommendations of his psychiatrist is recent and he has not established that this is a \npermanent behavioral change. He also chose to use marijuana from 2015 through \n2018, and he concealed this use from his employer and during his security investigation \nbecause he knew such use could have negative implications to his security clearance. \nWhile he admitted his marijuana use at hearing and expressed remorse over his \nfalsifications, the seriousness of his conduct leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nhis suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The record closed at the conclusion of the \nhearing and DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 6, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e and \n1.f. He admitted in part allegation \u00b6 2.a and denied allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.b with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 44 years old. He is married and has no children. He completed a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and began working as a systems administrator with a DOD \ncontractor shortly afterwards. He received his first security clearance with the start of this \nemployment and has maintained a security clearance throughout his career. (Answer; \nGX 1-3; AX 4; Tr. 44-51) \nSince 2006, Applicant has been consistently employed with various DOD \ncontractors, primarily as a systems engineer or project manager. His work has always \nfocused on a single DOD technical system. He has been with his sponsoring employer \nsince November 2022 as a project manager. (Answer; GX 1-3; AX 4; Tr. 51-69) \nIn 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic violence (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nHe testified that he was about 18 years old at the time when an ex-girlfriend asked him to \nmeet for dinner. He agreed and, at the end of the evening, he drove her home and she \nrefused to leave his vehicle. He then left the vehicle and walked away. When he returned \nlater, she was gone and he drove away. She later filed charges stating that he shoved \nand pulled her out of the vehicle which caused bruising. He stated that alcohol was not \ninvolved in this event. (Answer; GX 2-3; Tr. 117-119) \nApplicant recalled receiving a summons and, several months later, appearing in \nfront of a judge where he denied the charges. He was found guilty of harassment and a \nrestraining order was issued against him. He never violated the restraining order and no \nlonger has any contact with the ex-girlfriend. He disclosed this event in his November \n2007 security clearance application (SCA). (Answer; GX 2-3; Tr. 218-220) \nIn October 2004, Applicant received a citation for an open container of alcohol \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.a). Applicant admitted this allegation and described being outside of his \nhome when an argument started between one of his friends and a neighbor. When the \npolice arrived, Applicant was on the street with an alcoholic beverage and received the \ncitation. He paid the fine and the matter was resolved.

Applicant admitted this \nallegation and stated that, at the time, he had been working long shifts, was experiencing \na toxic work environment, and was exhausted. He described consuming alcohol at a \nbrunch with friends before returning home to rest. He later drove to another friend\u2019s house \nand was pulled over for speeding. He underwent a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer \ntest, but could not recall his blood alcohol content (BAC). Shortly after he was arrested \nfor DUI, he reported the event to his facility security officer (FSO). He received probation \nbefore judgment and was required to take DUI educational courses as well as participate \nin community service. He timely completed all of his court-ordered obligations. (Answer; \nGX 3, 6; Tr. 113-115, 194-199) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged with contempt of court \nin June 2009. While a State A record of criminal history reflects this information, Applicant \nstated that he was never arrested and that this event involved an erroneous warrant that \nwas issued by the court relating to his December 2008 DUI charge. He stated that the \nDUI charge transferred jurisdictions and he believed that the initial court erred by not \nremoving a scheduled hearing. He testified that his counsel at the time communicated \nwith the courts and the charge was nullified. (Answer; GX 3, 6; Tr. 110-113) \nIn 2010, Applicant continued to be subjected to a hostile work environment in State \nA and began experiencing family stressors as his parents divorced. He described being \nin a \u201cdark place\u201d during this period and, in about September 2010, he attempted to commit \nsuicide by consuming alcohol and pills. (Tr. 212) He was hospitalized for about three days \nbefore being discharged. Subsequently, he voluntarily received outpatient treatment with \na clinical psychologist from about October 2010 through December 2010. He disclosed \nhis December 2008 DUI arrest and other stressors to the psychologist and was diagnosed \nwith dysthymia and alcohol abuse (SOR \u00b6 2.b) as well as a thyroid condition. He was \nprescribed Wellbutrin for depression. Applicant testified that he was treated for \ndepression and anxiety during this period and denied being treated for alcohol abuse. \nHowever, he recalled the psychologist encouraging him to reduce his alcohol \nconsumption and to be mindful of the potential interactions it could have with his \nmedication. (Answer; GX 1, 3, 7; Tr. 120-125, 206-212, 230-233) \nIn December 2010, Applicant moved to State B and changed to a new employer \nwhile continuing to work on the same underlying DOD technical system. He described \nthis move as extremely beneficial to his mental health as the work atmosphere greatly \nimproved. He discontinued any mental health treatment or medication, but did continue \nto consume alcohol. (GX 1; AX 4; Tr. 49-52, 230-235) \nIn February 2015, Applicant chose to drive after consuming alcohol at a bar with \nfriends. He was pulled over for speeding. During the stop, he admitted to drinking alcohol \nand underwent a field sobriety test. Based on advice received from his previous counsel \nrelating to his 2008 DUI, he refused to undergo a breathalyzer test. He was arrested and \ncharged with felony and misdemeanor DUI offenses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a).

While charges were pending, he obtained counsel, voluntarily \nenrolled in alcohol education courses and had an ignition interlock system placed in his \nvehicle. He received two years of probation before judgment on the lesser of the DUI \ncharges. The probation was later changed to unsupervised. He remained sober during \nhis two years of probation while subject to alcohol and drug testing and completed all of \nhis court-ordered obligations. (Answer; GX 1, 3-4; AX J; Tr. 109-112; 168-180) \nIn December 2015, during a background interview with a DOD investigator, \nApplicant provided details of his past DUIs and described learning self-control. He stated \nhis intent was to never drink and drive again and to always use a designated driver. (GX 3) \nNonetheless, in July 2018, Applicant consumed alcohol at a work-related social \nevent. Afterwards, while driving home, he was pulled over for allegedly driving at 100 mph \nin a 65 mph zone. During the stop, he admitted to consuming alcohol and underwent a \nfield sobriety test. He again refused a breathalyzer test and was charged with DUI (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a). He reported this event to his FSO. On the advice of counsel and prior to the \nadjudication of his charges, he had an interlock system placed in his vehicle and \nparticipated in a twelve-week outpatient treatment program. (Answer; GX 1, 3, 5; AX J-L; \nTr.87-91, 135-138) \nIn November 2018, Applicant submitted to an agreed statement of facts and was \nfound guilty of a misdemeanor DUI and traffic offenses. He was sentenced to 90 days of \nhome arrest and two years of supervised probation. He estimated that, during this time, \nhe stopped drinking alcohol and attended about 40 to 50 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings. Based on his positive actions, his probation was later changed so that his \nsecond year was unsupervised. With an early release, his probation was completed in \nJune 2020. An alcohol restriction was also placed on his license, which was lifted in \nNovember 2022. (Answer; GX 1, 3-5, 7; AX J-L; Tr. 94-100, 139-145) \nFollowing completion of the outpatient program, Applicant began psychotherapy. \nFrom April 2019 through mid-2020, this treatment focused on anxiety and depression \nmanagement as well as \u201cexploration of his history of alcohol use.\u201d (AX L) He described \nthis treatment as instrumental in changing his life and learned behavioral health exercises \nto better address his underlying stressors of anxiety and depression. However, with the \nCOVID pandemic, Applicant attended a few telehealth sessions before terminating \ntreatment. (Answer; GX 1, 3; AX L; Tr. 100-105) \nIn about the fall of 2020, Applicant resumed consuming alcohol. However, he \nsignificantly reduced his consumption to one or two drinks at a time. He married in \nNovember 2020 and described beneficial changes in his social and work environments. \nHe stopped going out with friends to drink, instead choosing to have friends come over to \nwatch a game. His work commitments became more predictable and less stressful. He \ndescribed \u201cmoving to a different phase\u201d of his life and being in a better place \u201cemotionally, \nmentally, and spiritually.\u201d (Tr. 126, 155) His wife and friends are aware of his past DUIs \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand he described having a support system in place to assist in managing his life stressors. \n(Tr. 125-155, 253-256) \nIn May 2023, on his own accord, Applicant underwent an alcohol abuse \nassessment with a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Based on statements from the \nApplicant as well as assessments under the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and the \nAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Patient Placement Criteria (PPC)-2R, \nthe counselor opined that Applicant did not show any indicators of addiction or \ndependency and that alcohol or drug counseling was not necessary. (AX O) \nIn February 2024, Applicant renewed his treatment for generalized anxiety disorder \nand depression through his primary care provider (PCP). He described the mental health \nmedications as assisting in \u201cregular life maintenance\u201d and he was considering additional \ncounseling to further manage his symptoms of anxiety and depression. (Tr. 230-245) \nApplicant\u2019s work colleague, Mr. P, testified on behalf of Applicant. He described \ninitially working with Applicant in 2015, but becoming professional and personal friends in \n2016. Mr. P stated he was unaware of Applicant\u2019s 2015 DUI arrest, but was familiar with \nhis 2018 DUI arrest. Mr. P described the 2018 arrest as having a significant impact on \nApplicant. Following the arrest, Applicant began going out after work less, staying home \nmore and reducing his alcohol consumption. Mr. P described that they both had matured \nover the years as Mr. P was now engaged to be married and Applicant was married. He \ndescribed Applicant as a \u201creliable, responsible and respected\u201d person who worked in a \nsupervisory role and was highly trusted in the workplace. (Tr. 20-39) \nApplicant submitted several character reference letters from individuals who have \nworked with him over the last decade. They described Applicant as a \u201cmost trusted \ncolleague\u201d who was candid about his past conduct and exhibited \u201cno pattern of reckless \nbehavior.\u201d (Answer) One reference specifically noted that Applicant was mindful of his \nown mental health while mentoring those around him. (Answer; AX E-I) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption and Guideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government's security concern about alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 lists alcohol consumption conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case including: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s security concern about criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists criminal conduct conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case including: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that he was arrested on three \nseparate occasions for DUI offenses in 2008, 2015 and 2018. With regard to the last \noffense, he was also charged with traveling at 100 mph in a 65 mph zone. His suicide \nattempt in 2010 involved alcohol and, while his subsequent treatment focused on \ndepression and anxiety, he was also diagnosed with alcohol abuse. \nApplicant also admits, and the evidence supports, that he was charged with a \ndomestic violence offense in 2003 and received an open container citation in 2004. He \ndenies that he was arrested and charged with contempt of court in 2009. However, the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is sufficient to establish this security concern. The disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 22 are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. The disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 31 are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 32 details conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe central issue to consider in mitigation is whether Applicant presented sufficient \nevidence to mitigate and overcome the security concerns raised by his alcohol \nconsumption that led to a diagnosis of alcohol abuse and three DUI offenses. Applicant \nfirst experienced a DUI arrest in State A in 2008 during a period of high stress and \nturbulence in his personal and professional life. Two years later, he used alcohol as part \nof his suicide attempt. As part of his subsequent therapy, he was diagnosed with alcohol \nabuse. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nHowever, he then moved to State B where his circumstances significantly \nimproved. He chose to stop receiving mental health treatment and appeared to maintain \ncontrol over his alcohol consumption. Still, his second DUI, in 2015, was not a \nconsequence of high stress or a toxic work environment. It occurred after he had drinks \nwith friends at a bar. As a condition of his probation, he maintained sobriety for over two \nyears. In December 2015, he told a DOD investigator that he had learned self-control and \nwas never going to drink and drive again. Yet, less than three years later, in 2018, he was \narrested again for DUI. \nApplicant fully acknowledged the errors in judgement he made surrounding the \nDUI arrests. After the 2018 arrest, he committed to making serious changes to his lifestyle \nand alcohol consumption. In the years that followed, he took alcohol classes, completed \nan alcohol treatment program, attended therapy, addressed his mental health concerns \nand made changes to his social situation. He committed to not going out and drinking and \nconsiderably reduced his overall alcohol consumption. He is now married and described \nmaturing and moving to a different phase of his life. \nAlthough Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse in 2010, he was never \nadvised to abstain from alcohol and his treatment has focused on anxiety and depression. \nIn May 2023, a licensed alcohol and drug counselor opined that Applicant did not show \nany indicators of addiction or dependency. Recently, he maintained his mental health \ntreatment through his PCP and was considering additional counseling. He has been \ncandid at home and at work about his past and has a strong support system around him. \nIn the six years since his last DUI, Applicant has established that his history of \nDUIs is unlikely to recur and no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness or judgment. He has acknowledged his pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse and, following treatment he received after the 2018 DUI, evidenced actions he took \nto modify his consumption and the circumstances around that consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \n(b) and (d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Since his last two DUIs occurred after \nhe received treatment in 2010, AG \u00b6 23(c) is only partially applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and \n2.b. \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances with regard to his alcohol consumption are also relevant \nin assessing the likelihood that his related criminal conduct, the DUIs, would recur. I find \nthat his completion of his probationary obligations, the passage of time, and his evidenced \nchange in circumstances over the last six years are sufficient to establish that his DUI \ncriminal conduct is unlikely to recur. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s 2003 charge of domestic violence occurred over twenty \nyears ago and he no longer associates with the ex-girlfriend who was involved in the \nincident. Alcohol was not involved in the incident. Further, he is now married and has not \nexperienced any similar domestic incidents. He has established that this event occurred \nunder unusual circumstances and, even when taken in consideration with his DUIs, does \nnot establish a pattern of criminal conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also denies being arrested in 2009 on the charge of contempt of court. \nAlthough a State A criminal record summary reflects the arrest, I find Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation that the charge related to a procedural error between two criminal courts to \nbe credible. This matter was resolved by his counsel at the time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) are \napplicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant provided a detailed and introspective analysis of his past difficulties with \nalcohol and acknowledged his pattern of maladaptive alcohol use that led to his three \nDUIs. In the six years that have since past, he has made substantive changes to how he \nhandles stressors and significantly reduced his alcohol consumption. \nI also had the opportunity to observe Applicant's demeanor during his hearing and \nfound that he was credible and candid. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant a security clearance.

(AE \nY) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), \nthe Appeal Board explained: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 which may be \napplicable in this case are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Her \ninjuries in a vehicle accident were extraordinary. She was unable to work and had \nsignificant medical expenses. Her income was no longer a part of their financial \nresources. The SOR lists 13 delinquent debts totaling $103,411. Applicant paid the four \nSOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. The creditor cancelled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h and \nissued an IRS Form 1099-C. Applicant was unable to locate the two medical debts under \n$200 each in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m, and those debts do not appear in his most recent credit \nreport of record. He is making payments on the four SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d and \n1.e. He has payment plans; however, he has not started to make payments addressing \nSOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g.   \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is designed \nto evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicants are not required \u201cto be debt-free in order \nto qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act \nresponsibly given his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to \neffectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (denial of \nsecurity clearance remanded) (citing ISCR Case No.13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n14, 2014)). There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be \npaid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant received financial counseling and generated a budget. He has a payment \nplan, and an established history of paying his debts. All of his tax returns are filed, and he \nis working in good faith to resolve his tax debt for TY 2023. He has taken meaningful \nactions to address his debts. His credit report indicates he has several debts in paid or \npaid as agreed status, and he has an established track record of paying several debts. \nHis history of making payments increases the confidence that he will make the promised \npayments in accordance with his payment plans. \nApplicant has demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old instructor for a DOD entity. In 2016, he received two \nassociate degrees in instructor methodology and aviation operations. He served in the Air \nForce from 1999 to 2021, and he honorably retired as a technical sergeant. His specialty \nat the end of his career was flight engineer. He was deployed during his career to Iraq \nand Afghanistan. He received six air medals as well as numerous other Air Force awards. \nThe general sense of the seven character statements is that Applicant is diligent, honest, \ndependable, trustworthy, and responsible. He is sincerely interested in establishing his \nfinancial responsibility. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse handled Applicant\u2019s finances. He was frequently deployed or \naway from his family due to work requirements. She accumulated substantial debts; \nhowever, she successfully avoided defaulting on them. She suffered catastrophic injuries \nin a vehicle accident; she was unable to work; and in 2019, multiple debts went into \ndefault. \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. He paid some debts, \nestablished payment plans on others, and is beginning payment plans on the last four \ndelinquent debts in August 2024. He is acting in good faith with all of his creditors. He \nunderstands that he needs to pay his debts, and the conduct required to retain his security \nclearance. He was sincere and credible at his hearing. His progress resolving his SOR \ndebts has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-payment. See ISCR Case \nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).

He has been working for his current employer as lead warehouse technician since September 2021. He testified he previously held a clearance for 12 years. (Tr. at 21, 22-23.) He also works in the music department for his church and multiple entertainment companies doing weddings and corporate events. He has worked at his church since 2010. He has been with one of the entertainment companies for two years and with the other since 2011. (Tr. at 25.) He offered character letters from his church and work evidence attesting to his work ethic, integrity, and commitment to family. (AE A; AE B.) He married in September 2016 and has two children, one high school age and the other starting grade school.

His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been working \nfor his current employer as lead warehouse technician since September 2021. He testified \nhe previously held a clearance for 12 years. (Tr. at 21, 22-23.) He also works in the music \ndepartment for his church and multiple entertainment companies doing weddings and \ncorporate events. He has worked at his church since 2010. He has been with one of the \nentertainment companies for two years and with the other since 2011. (Tr. at 25.) He \noffered character letters from his church and work evidence attesting to his work ethic, \nintegrity, and commitment to family. (AE A; AE B.) \nHe married in September 2016 and has two children, one high school age and the \nother starting grade school. A high school graduate, he has started taking computer \ncourses to reach a certification level. (Tr. at 22; GE 1 at 12-13, 22 25, 27.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant failed to timely file, as required, Federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 through 2021 and as of the date of the SOR tax returns \nfor tax years 2016, 2017, and 2021 remain unfiled.\n \n Applicant admits this allegation. \nThe income tax transcript for 2016 shows no tax return filed in 2016 as of December 28, \n2022. (GE 5.) After the hearing closed, he offered a 2016 Federal tax return signed by \nhim on October 3, 2023, and an October 3, 2023 receipt from a commercial tax preparer. \n(AE I; AE K.) He cited losing his job in 2015 for getting \u201coff track.\u201d (GE 5; Tr. at 27-28.) He \ndid not provide a tax transcript for 2017. He was not sure if the 2017 tax return were filed \nand he believed they had filed an extension. (Tr. at 31.) He acknowledged his failure to \nfile his 2018 tax returns on his SCA and in his security clearance interview. He cited in his \nsecurity clearance interview losing his job in February 2018; learning his wife was \npregnant in March 2018; having to move; and that his wife was in charge of filing their tax \nreturns and he never asked about them. He stated the reason the 2018 tax return had \nbeen filed in August 2022 was to get caught up because they were looking to purchase a \nhome. (GE 1 at 39; GE 2; Tr. at 32.) He told the investigator in July 2020 he thought the \n2019 and 2020 tax returns had been filed. (GE 2 at 3.) The tax transcript for 2019 reflects \nhe and his wife filed for an extension but that the tax return was not filed until May 2022. \n(GE 5; Tr. at 35.) He filed his 2020 tax return in June of 2022.

The October 2023 tax transcript for tax year 2022 shows that he \nhad filed a request for an extension of time on April 15, 2022, but as of October 2023 his \ntax year 2022 tax return had not been filed. (AE C; AE G; Tr. at 36-37.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant failed to timely file, as required, state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2016 through 2021 and as of the date of the SOR tax returns for tax \nyears 2016, 2017, and 2021 remain unfiled. Applicant admitted the allegation. In his \nAnswer he states he had filed an extension for \u201c2017 and going forward.\u201d (Answer.) He \nacknowledges he was a resident of his state in the time period in question. For 2016 he \ntestified \u201cI don't believe my [state] would be filed either.\u201d For 2017 he had no answer and \nstated he would have to log in to his portal. For the remaining years he stated \u201chonestly, \nhave to go through our records to see.\u201d (AE D; Tr. at 39.) After the hearing closed, he \noffered a 2016 state income tax return signed by him on October 3, 2023, and an October \n3, 2023 receipt from a commercial tax preparer. (AE J; AE K.) No other state returns were \noffered. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant is indebted to the Federal government in the \napproximate amount of $560 for delinquent taxes for tax year 2018. As of the date \nof the SOR the account remains delinquent. Applicant denied the debt and states in \nhis Answer he and his spouse are \u201cengaged\u201d in a payment plan for the debt and that he \nthought it was resolved. (Answer) The IRS amount balance shows him owing $560. (GE \n5 at 3.) In response to Government interrogatories, he provided an untitled receipt dated \nJuly 22, 2022, reflecting a credit card payment for \u201cindividual tax return payments\u201d in the \namount of $115.34. (GE 4 at 9.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a store account that has \nbeen placed in collection in the approximate amount of $1,450. As of the date of \nthe SOR the account remains delinquent. In his Answer, Applicant admits this debt \nand states he is in a weekly payment plan. (Answer.) In his testimony he admitted he was \ntaken to court and a 2022 judgment was awarded to the creditor. (Tr. at 41; GE 9.) He \nblamed the COVID pandemic for falling behind on his payments stating, \u201cI had been \nmaking the payments correctly and had no issues, and then I hate to keep bringing up \n2020, but happened and COVID and everything just kind of got thrown. Everything just \nkind of got thrown off so I missed some payments and didn't, unfortunately did not reach \nout to them to tell them that I was in financial straits\u2026so they submitted my account to \n[the creditor].\u201d (Tr. at 41-42.) He offered AE H showing he made twelve payments from \nJanuary 13, 2023, through April 10, 2023, totaling $1,601.40. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant is indebted for a store account that has been placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $1,970. As of the date of the SOR the\naccount remains delinquent.\n \n In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation on the basis \nthe debt had been paid in full. He testified the reason it became delinquent was because \nhe lost his job shortly after he had purchased an engagement ring and with the loss of \nwages his payments slowed and eventually stopped.

In \nlate 2020, the creditor took him to court and a default judgment was obtained in January \n2021. (Tr. at 45; GE 8.) He testified he paid it in full around November 2022. (Tr. at 46.) \nIn response to Government interrogatories dated October 13, 2021, and February 28, \n2022, he marked the debt was not paid; that he was making payments; and that he had \nnot attached documentation showing payment status or proof of payments. (GE at 4; GE \nat 4.) A January 2023 credit report shows the debt as a charge-off; with a last payment in \nFebruary 2021; and the first major delinquency in November 2018. The account was \nopened in March 2014. (GE at 6.) He told the investigator he had missed payments \nbecause he was paying for the wedding and could not afford both. (GE 2 at 3.) He \ntravelled overseas twice in 2016 for tourism, with both trips occurring after his 2016 \nwedding. (GE 1 at 31, 33.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony and the evidence admitted establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent taxes and unresolved debts \nare long-standing and ongoing. His recent actions do not mitigate his inaction, which casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant did experience conditions that contributed \nto his financial problems, unemployment and the COVID pandemic, which were largely \nbeyond his control. He did not act responsibly under the circumstances. He did not begin \nto address these financial problems until well after the security clearance application \nprocess had begun. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant did not take action to resolve his \ndelinquent taxes or his debts until he began the security clearance process. Evidence of \npast irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying \nfor a security clearance. While he made tax payments for different tax years in early 2022, \napplicants who begin to address their security-significant conduct only when their \npersonal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. \n16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of \nan individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

Even if an applicant has \npaid his or her debts, an administrative judge may still consider the circumstances \nunderlying the debts for what they may reveal about the applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nclearance. ISCR Case No. 14-02394 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015.) \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. In regard to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nFederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2021, the DOHA Appeal \nBoard has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

The \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] Federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file Federal income tax returns. \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd.

June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 Federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 Federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received Federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this instance, Applicant in his post-hearing submission provided evidence he \nfiled his overdue 2016 Federal and state income tax returns on October 3, 2023, thirteen \ndays after the hearing. His 2019 Federal tax return was filed in May 2022 and his 2020 \nFederal tax return was filed in June 2022. He did not establish a record of a payment plan \nto address the Federal tax debt but did provide a receipt indicating a payment. However, \nthe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] Federal [or state] tax problem, and the fact that [a]pplicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely pay Federal income taxes when \ndue. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \n\u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s \nwell that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).  \nApplicant admitted that he had not filed tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and \n2021, and post-hearing submitted some evidence he filed his tax year 2016 Federal and \nstate income tax returns. He did not provide any evidence his returns for tax years 2017 \nor 2021 were ever filed. Additionally, it appears that he did not claim or submit any \nevidence that any state returns were filed after tax year 2016. His failures to timely file his \nFederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2021 are not mitigated \nat this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered the character \nevidence attesting to his work ethic, integrity, and commitment to family. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

(Tr. 18-20; AE P) \nPersonal Conduct/Sexual Behavior/Financial Considerations/Use of Information \nTechnology \nThe conduct that gave rise to these concerns occurred during Applicant\u2019s previous \nemployment with a different defense contractor. He was employed by this defense \ncontractor from July 2011 to May 2021.

(Tr. 48-51) The SOR alleged four concerns that \narose from this termination: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (Personal Conduct) \u2013 terminated for misconduct in violation of company \npolicies: (1) timesheet accounting, (2) employee misconduct and disciplinary action, (3) \ninformation technology acceptable use policy, and (4) company standards of ethics and \nbusiness conduct; \nSOR \u00b6 2.a (Sexual Behavior) - between March 2021 and April 2021, Applicant \nused his company computer to view pornographic images on a recurring basis; \nSOR \u00b6 3.a (Financial Considerations) \u2013 between March 2021 and April 2021, \nApplicant mischarged approximately 15.5 hours of time to a direct program that were not \nworked based on recurring inappropriate use of his company computer during working \nhours; and \nSOR \u00b6 4.a (Use of Information Technology) - the SOR cross-alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 2.a under Use of Information Technology. \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 4.a, and denied 2.a \nand 3.a. In his SOR response, he also provided mitigating information. His admissions \nare accepted as findings of fact. \nDuring the March 2021 to April 2021 timeframe, which was during the COVID-19 \nlockdown, Applicant was assigned to an 8,000 square foot workspace with \u201ctwo other \npeople routinely in the building . . [so] social distancing . . . was never an issue.\u201d (Tr. 21-\n22, 46-48) He described his work responsibilities to include, but not limited to, managing \ntwo large separate Government contracts that required Teams meetings, as well as \naccess to navy.mil course development programs. He found these requirements \nchallenging due to firewall access issues, discussed below. (SOR Answer) \nWithout access or limited internet access, Applicant was having trouble getting his \nwork done and became increasingly frustrated. He stated that he did not have any local \nsupport as most other company employees were working on another coast and he was \nnot getting the assistance he needed. (GE 2, May 24, 2022 Office of Personnel \nManagement Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI), p. 2) In April 2021, Applicant\u2019s \ncompany information technology (IT) department discovered that he had been accessing \npornographic sites on his company-issued computer. (Tr. 22-24) Applicant stated: \n. . . my issue with IT was I could never get on the .mil sites that I needed to \ndo our work and they did not respond to calls to fix and I just thought, well, \nmaybe, you know \u2013 not a good decision on my part, but \u2013 I said, well maybe \nif I do something like this, they will notice that and call me and say, \u201cCan I \nhelp you,\u201d and they didn\u2019t. . . . So pornographic sites, even any firewall will \nblock those, but search engine stuff is what they found and \u2013 . . .

Specifically, it appears that [Applicant] recorded \n15.5 hours from March 1, 2021 to April 21, 2021 that were not worked based \non a recurring inappropriate use of his [company] computer during working \nhours. (GE 3, p. 4) \nApplicant stated that he wanted the IT department to see that he was able to \naccess pornographic sites and that he was unable to access his .mil accounts or accounts \nthat he needed to do his job \u201cbecause the firewall keeps blocking me, which made it really \nchallenging to do the research kind of work that I need to do for the documents I prepare. \nSo it was a misguided effort to get somebody to fix it. They were 3,000 miles away, \nprobably in their parents\u2019 basement.\u201d (Tr. 24) As an example, he would use a search term \n\u201cnude\u201d and added , \u201cIf you clicked on the results, then it brought up a firewall.\u201d So it was \njust \u2013 again, I was trying to just get somebody to talk to me about it. Which they did, but \nafter the fact.\u201d (Tr. 26) \nDepartment Counsel (DC) queried the Applicant further about the viewing of \npornographic images. She attempted to clarify whether Applicant was able to make it past \nthe firewall or whether the firewall did not exist for certain sites. Applicant stated, \u201cIf you \ndo a search, an image search, it will bring up the image. . . . And then \u2013 but if you click on \nwhatever the image is, then it takes you to the site which is what \u2013 which I really didn\u2019t \nhave time to do.\u201d (Tr. 26-27) Applicant stated that he did not view videos, \u201cbecause, again, \nvideos don\u2019t run off the \u2013 at least my \u2013 my basic understanding of IT is that videos don\u2019t \nrun off of the browser search. It will take you to I think whatever the site you\u2019re searching.\u201d \n(Tr. 27) \nDC: Well, in for example Government Exhibit 3, page 4, they (Applicant\u2019s \nemployer) note that it would be up to 2.5 hours per day that they\u2019re saying \nyou were searching or viewing pornographic images. So that \u2013 the way I\u2019m \nreading that means either you\u2019re spending up to that amount of time \nsearching or you had either images or videos pulled up during the duration \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nof that time, this 2.5 hours we\u2019re talking about.

What was open? \nApplicant: The browser search engine was open type stuff. \nDC: Okay. \nApplicant: Again, open in the background or minimized. \nDC: And explain to me how \u2013 how you envisioned having that browser result \nsitting there, how is that going to raise issues with a firewall? \nApplicant: Well, I mean, ultimately it worked because they eventually called \nme. It just wasn\u2019t real time. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it was \u2013 the whole issue of \ngetting onto the required .mil account sites was a \u2013 was a hit-or-miss. Five \ndays, it would work one day. Tr. 28-29) \nApplicant stated what he was \u201ctrying to prove\u201d was that the firewall would not let \nhim get him get to a navy.mil account, i.e. the firewall would block that account, but would \nnot block things such as pornographic web sites. (Tr. 30) Applicant stated that he \u201ccalled \nIT\u201d or \u201cleft a ticket number\u201d or \u201csent it (service request) by email\u201d to resolve the firewall \nissue and \u201c[a]nd never got any resolution on it.\u201d Applicant stated he contacted his IT \ndepartment \u201cprobably weekly\u201d to resolve the firewall problem. (Tr. 31, 46) Applicant did \nnot raise these issues with his supervisor stating, \u201ccause I kept \u2013 I kept getting enough \ndone that I didn\u2019t miss any deadlines for it.\u201d (Tr. 31, 46) He did not provide a copy of the \nticket or emails to IT for inclusion in the hearing record. \nApplicant acknowledged that between March 2021 and April 2021, he was aware \nthat it was against company policy to use his work computer to view pornography. (Tr. \n32) \nDC: Okay, And even assuming that, you know, everything you\u2019re saying is \ntrue and you were trying to raise concerns with IT, can you see the concern \nabout your judgment and violation of policy with the way that you \napproached trying to \u2013  \nApplicant: I did. I admit that up front. It was a dumb thing to do \u2013 driven \nobviously by frustration on my part and probably a little bit by the pandemic, \nlack of working \u2013 frustration. Yeah, I \u2013 it was stupid.

And you deny that; right? \nApplicant: I do. \nDC: Why do you deny that? \nApplicant: Well, like I said, I was working on \u2013 so \u2013 I\u2019m trying to remember. \nThat\u2019s over two years ago. Again, I was \u2013 I was working actively on at least \nfour of the [project description] at the same time. I was helping out on a \ncouple \nother \nenvironmental \nassessments, \nenvironmental \nimpact \nstatements. And I also \u2013 because I also picked up management of programs \nfrom my coworker who went back on active duty. I was managing a contract \nin [state] with the [Navy command] and something else \u2013 and closing out \nanother contract that we had locally. All of that was without any billable \nhours for me. So \u2013 not doing pro bono, but I was doing a lot of program \nmanagement work without being compensated. So I had more work to do \nthan I had time to do. (Tr. 33-34) \nApplicant\u2019s employer never tried to recoup back pay for the 15.5 hours Applicant \nreportedly did not work based on recurring inappropriate use of his computer during \nworking hours. Applicant stated, \u201cBecause I met all the deliverables that was required for \nall of them. Applicant stated that he was never given the opportunity to prove that he was \nworking during those hours. (Tr. 34) Applicant stated he was able to complete his work \nwhile his browser with pornographic websites was usually minimized. (Tr. 51-52) \nReferring to Government Exhibit 2, page 11, which was Applicant\u2019s May 24, 2022 \nOPM PSI, DC queried him further. \nDC: Because in your interview, you described trying to access random \nwebsites to prove the absurdity of what was being blocked. And the largest \nparagraph on that page, sort of in the center, it said \u2013 and this is her words \n(investigator), not yours, but it said \u2013 it says, \u201cThe subject started accessing \nrandom sites on the Internet that should be blocked, trying to show the \nabsurdity of what was being blocked, which is what he accessed to that \nissue. Subject would put up websites with access on one of his computer \nscreens while he was doing his actual work on the other screen. Subject \nwas not accessing any particular websites and was just opening websites \nthat he felt should have been blocked by the firewalls and weren\u2019t. Subject \nwould open the websites and then ignore them while he worked, because \nhe could.\u201d  \nAnd that makes it sound more like you were clicking on actual websites.

(Tr. 37-38) \nApplicant stated that he lost his local IT support in 2020 when company employees \nvacated their workspaces and began teleworking as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. \n(Tr. 43-45) \nApplicant commented:  \nThe phrase, you know, one \u201cAw shucks\u201d wipes out a whole bunch of \n\u201cAttaboys,\u201d but it did \u2018cause I was very successful with [previous employer], \nalthough I was \u2013 like I told the investigator that was for my clearance, it was \ngetting frustrating in that job anyway, not \u2013 not for the IT issues, but for \nsome of the other changes in how things were going.

(AE C \u2013 AE S) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that that individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . .  \n(4) \nevidence \nof \nsignificant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources. \nThe record raises the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(4). AG \u00b6 \n16(c) is not established because there is credible adverse information in several \nadjudicative issue areas that is sufficient for an adverse determination under other \nguidelines. AG \u00b6 16(d)(4) applies requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b). \nAG \u00b6 17 includes three conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtaining counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and (e) are partially applicable. However, Applicant did not \nsufficiently establish these mitigating conditions given the serious lapses of judgment he \nexercised over a two-month period between March 2021 and April 2021, when he used \nhis company computer to view pornographic images on a recurring basis. Furthermore, \nhis excuse for this misconduct is that he intended to flag the lack of IT support and the \nimproper blocking of Navy websites he needed for his work. This explanation is not \ncredible. His failure to take responsibility for his poor decisions shows a lack of \nrehabilitation. While Applicant acknowledged his lapses in judgment, apart from his \nassurances of remorse and completion of security training, there is no record evidence to \nsuggest such behavior will not recur. \nSexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 articulates the security concern for sexual behavior: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; and \n(d) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) and (d), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 includes four conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and  \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAG \u00b6 14(c) applies. Applicant used his company computer to view pornographic \nimages on a recurring basis between March 2021 and April 2021 in his workspace. In \ndoing so, he exercised very poor judgment. His behavior no longer serves as a basis for \ncoercion because cognizant supervisors know about it. He completed security training, \nand he is well aware of the consequences of viewing pornography on a government \ncomputer. I do not believe he would engage in such behavior in the future. Given his \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndemonstrated lack of remorse, however, the lack of discretion and poor judgment he \nexhibited remain unmitigated concerns. \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nThe record evidence establishes disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(d) requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes three conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial misconduct: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions fully apply. The Government\u2019s evidence \ndocuments that Applicant mischarged approximately 15.5 hours of time to a direct \nprogram that were not actually worked, during his recurring use of his company computer \nto access pornographic websites during working hours. Although Applicant claims that he \ncompleted his work assignments, he placed himself in an unjustifiable position of having \nopen pornographic sites, albeit allegedly \u201cminimized\u201d, at the same time he billed hours to \na client. His explanation that he did not view these sites for 15.5 hours is not credible. \nThere is no evidence to support his claim that he did not view pornography on his \ncompany computer during those duty hours. His employer\u2019s IT department found that up \nto 2.5 hours might have been mischarged because of Applicant\u2019s searching and viewing \npornographic images. I have given deference to Applicant\u2019s previous employer\u2019s internal \ninvestigation and characterization of events in these proceedings. While it is unclear how \nmuch timecard fraud occurred, I am confident that some occurred in this case. \nUse Of Information Technology \nAG \u00b6 39 articulates the security concern for use of information technology: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 described one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 40(e), requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 41 includes four conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom applicant use of information technology: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness;  \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and  \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are fully applicable. Applicant was experienced \nand well versed in matters of security. The record evidence documents his repeated \naccessing and searching of pornographic sites. Company records use the term \n\u201csearching and viewing pornographic images.\u201d This is very different from someone who \ndoes this once, realizes the error of their ways, and never does it again. Applicant \ncontinued to engage in this inappropriate behavior until he was caught. This recurring and \nrepeated searching and accessing of pornographic sites, in and of itself, raises serious \nconcerns, particularly as it pertains to judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines E, D, \nF, and M are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nWhen evaluating this case, two things come to mind. Either Applicant is telling the \ntruth and exercised a severe lack of judgment over an extended period of time by \naccessing pornographic sites during a two-month period to get the attention of and \ndemonstrate to his company\u2019s IT department that his company had a problem with their \nfirewalls. Alternatively, Applicant is lying about intentionally accessing pornographic sites \nduring work hours on his company-issued computer and caused his company to bill \nclients for the time when he was accessing these sites. In either case, he did so in clear \nviolation of company policy. Applicant failed to provide proof that he notified his supervisor \nor IT personnel that he was experiencing these firewall problems that he claims inhibited \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nhis ability to complete his job assignments. \nThe record evidence and objective \nassessment of his credibility establish that Appellant lied when he provided a false \nnarrative about his reasons for going to pornographic sites during the duty day. HIs false \nstatements and attempted justifications at his hearing show a lack a rehabilitation and \nweigh against continuing his national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nWith that said, Applicant\u2019s record of accomplishments is extraordinary. He has \ndedicated his entire adult working life to the national defense as a uniformed officer and \nlater as a defense contractor. He is highly regarded by his superiors as a true professional \nand someone who can be relied upon. For privacy considerations, this part of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground is not discussed in further detail. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n15 \n",

She indicates most of the debts were incurred \nbetween 2014 \u2013 2017. She incurred the credit card debts during times when she was \nunemployed. She was laid off twice within a four-year time span. The foreclosure \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.s occurred at a time when she owned two homes. One was a rental \nproperty and she lived in the other one. The tenant in the rental property broke her \nlease at a time when Applicant was unemployed. She claims she had to choose \nbetween the two houses and let the rental property go to foreclosure. She testified that \nthe 2016 foreclosure is no longer in her credit report. She is not certain how much was \nowed after the foreclosure. (Tr. 39-40) The apartment debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f \noccurred because she was laid off and had to move out. She moved to state 1 where \nshe thought the cost of living would be cheaper. (Answer to SOR) \nApplicant did not file federal and state income taxes for tax year 2018 because \nshe was a full-time student at the time who worked part-time jobs. She believed her \ngross income was under the limit. She discovered the tax return needed to be filed \nwhen applying for financial aid for her daughter\u2019s education. (Answer to SOR) She filed \nthe 2018 federal income tax return on June 21, 2021. She owes the IRS $528.73 for tax \nyear 2018; and $464.84 for tax year 2019. She has not filed her federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2021. (Tr. 26-27, 30-35; GE 2 at 24-27; 30) She testified that she is \nnot sure whether she filed her state income tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2021.

She submitted disputes with the \ncredit reporting agencies. After some research, the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l was \nconfirmed as valid. She testified she has to prove that it is not her debt, but has not \nfollowed through the dispute. She has not received a response regarding her dispute of \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Tr. 41-43) \nApplicant has paid off several debts that were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 42) At \nthe end of the hearing, Applicant mentioned that she is considering filing for bankruptcy. \nShe has consulted two bankruptcy attorneys but has not hired one yet. (Tr. 47-48) After \nthe hearing, she provided a receipt for a payment made to her college in the amount of \n$504.90. (AE H) It is unclear if this relates to the student loan debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.p and 1.q. \nApplicant keeps a budget, but it is not written down. She currently earns between \n$83,000 and $85,000 annually. She occasionally provides support to her daughter who \nrecently graduated from college. Her net monthly income is approximately $4,200. Her \ntotal monthly expenses are approximately $2,500. She rents a home with her daughter \nand son-in-law. They each contribute one third to the household expenses. She has \nabout $900 in her checking account, $500 in a savings account, and $15,000 in a \nretirement account. She tries to save $1,000 a month, but recently had expensive car \nrepairs that cost between $5,000 and $6,000. (Tr. 17-24) \nHer financial problems began when she was laid off in 2015. She was also laid \noff in 2016 and 2017. Between August 2014 to December 2017, she was a full-time \ncollege student who worked part-time. She attended college using the GI Bill. She was \nunemployed between February 2019 to August 2019. She lived off her savings and \nworked part-time in a grocery store. (Tr. 28-30) She also has a chronic medical \ncondition. (Tr. 49)  \nApplicant\u2019s integrity is very important to her. Her divorce and health issues have \nmade things challenging. She has a strong allegiance to the United States. She has \nbeen waiting for an opportunity to get a security clearance for 15 years. Obtaining and \nkeeping a security clearance is important to her. (Answer to SOR) \nWhole-Person Evidence \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s colleagues and friends provided letters on her behalf. Mr. \nR., her current supervisor, highly recommends Applicant be granted a security \nclearance. He has supervised her for two years. He finds her to be extremely \ntrustworthy and competent. She continues to learn and has become a valuable asset to \nthe team. (AE A; AE B) Ms. L., a friend and co-worker, describes Applicant as honest, \nforthright, and no-nonsense.

(AE E) \nOther co-workers and former co-workers have said similar favorable things about \nApplicant. (AE F; AE G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. She also \nfailed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2018, 2021, \nand 2022. She owes delinquent taxes to the IRS for tax years 2018 and 2019.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nWhile Applicant intends to pay her debts, the alleged delinquent debts remain \nunresolved. SOR \u00b6 1.a does not apply because her financial issues are ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control \nadversely affected her financial situation. Since 2017, she has experienced periods of \nunemployment, significant health issues, a painful divorce, and recent costly car repairs. \nThis mitigating condition is given less weight because I cannot conclude Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances because she did not develop a plan to repay her \ndelinquent debts once she found stable employment in January 2022. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. Applicant has not sought financial \ncounseling from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and her financial problems are not being resolved. She did not initiate a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Although Applicant disputed the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, and 1.l, there is insufficient information in the record to conclude the \ndisputes were reasonable or successful. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies with respect to Applicant filing her 2018 federal and state \nincome tax returns. It does apply with respect to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2021 and 2022, as well as her failure \nto pay or make payment arrangements with the IRS for federal taxes owed for tax year \n2018 ($528) and tax year 2019 ($467). \nWith regard to tax issues, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). \nWhile Applicant appears to be sincere about wanting to resolve her financial \nproblems and tax issues, she has not taken proactive steps towards resolving them. \nThe evidence is insufficient for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will \nbe resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered the favorable recommendations of Applicant\u2019s supervisor, ex-\nhusband, co-workers, and friends. I considered that she underwent periods of \nunemployment, a divorce, health issues, and unanticipated car repairs. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to timely file her state and federal tax returns and/or pay her state and federal \ntaxes for 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022 raise more serious security concerns. Her \ndelinquent debt appears to be manageable. She needs to assess her financial situation \nand develop a plan for repaying her delinquent accounts. At the close of the record, she \nhad no plan in place to resolve her delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s history of financial \nproblems and tax issues remain a concern. \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under Financial \nConsiderations. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nErin C. Hogan \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that Applicant was arrested in 2020 and charged with \ndischarging a firearm into an occupied vehicle and assault with a deadly weapon with \nintent to kill. Applicant reported that he had a dispute with another motorist at a stop sign. \nHe reported he was threatened and got out of the car with his firearm and warned the \nother motorist to leave him alone. He claimed he let the other person drive away, but the \ndriver later found him on the road and swiped into him and spun his car out. The police \nreport shows that Applicant called 911 and told them he discharged his firearm at a car \nthat tried to run him off the road, however he told police he did not shoot at the vehicle. \nAfter the police arrived, the other motorist returned and claimed that Applicant shot at his \ncar, and he swiped Applicant\u2019s car in self-defense. Police found two bullet holes in the \nother motorist\u2019s car door. After police told Applicant that they would swab his hands for \ngun residue, he stated that he had shot his firearm at a friend\u2019s house earlier in the day, \nand they would not find any shell casings if they investigated. At the hearing, he stated \nhe did not shoot his gun, but rather brandished it to deter the other motorist. (Tr. 23-72; \nGE 2, 3; AE D, E) \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated he pled no contest to the charges. He stated that \nhe entered this plea because his lawyer told him that it would be easier to get it over with. \nHe reported that the police took his firearm, but he was not sentenced to jail time. In his \n2021 SCA, he wrote that the district attorney dropped all the charges. In his 2021 \nbackground interview with a government investigator, he stated that he was told that no \ncharges would be pursued if both parties to the incident dropped the charges against the \nother, and if Applicant relinquished his firearm to police. (Tr. 72-79; GE 1, 2, 3) \nPost hearing, Applicant provided documentation showing that the charges were \ndismissed in April 2021, and his record was expunged in August 2021. He did not provide \nany other documentation showing why the charges were dismissed or corroborating his \nversion of events. (AE D, E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that Applicant was arrested in 2018 for DUI. In a plea \nagreement, he pled guilty to reckless driving and in July 2022 was sentenced to 12 \nmonths of probation, fines, attendance at a victim impact panel, and 40 hours of \ncommunity service. Applicant stated that he went out for his birthday, he was drinking, \nand was pulled over for swerving. According to the citation, he blew a .183 on the \nbreathalyzer. He has not had any other alcohol related arrests. (Tr. 23-72; GE 2, 3, 4; AE \nB, C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that Applicant was still on probation from his DUI conviction in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the credit \nreports, tax account transcripts, and Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) \napply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond  \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged unfiled or unpaid taxes and delinquent debts are being \npaid, are resolved, or became delinquent under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nHis failure to file and pay his taxes and to pay the delinquent debts are both long-term \nand recent, as well as ongoing and unresolved. His behavior continues to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s legal expenses for his child custody battle \nwere circumstances beyond his control; however, he did not provide sufficient evidence \nto find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Despite his assertions that \nsome of these debts were resolved, he has taken no action to resolve his tax issues or \ncontact creditors and set up payment arrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing \na good-faith effort to repay creditors or resolve debts, and he has not established any \nmeaningful track record of debt payments. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation to \nestablish a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-due debts or evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation to \nestablish that he has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay \nthe amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nThe criminal conduct security concerns are established by the police and court \nrecords and Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31 (a) and 31 (b) apply. Applicant provided \ndocumentation showing that he is no longer on parole, so AG \u00b6 31 (c) does not apply and \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is found for Applicant. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant had only one DUI arrest. \nThere have been no reoccurrences in the last six years, and enough time has passed to \nfind that this arrest no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. The Government provided \nsufficient evidence to find that Applicant discharged a firearm into an occupied vehicle. \nApplicant\u2019s story has evolved over time, and his versions of events are not credible. \nAlthough Applicant presented evidence showing that the charges were dismissed and \nexpunged from his record, he did not provide sufficient documentation supporting his \nversion of events or exonerating him. Over time, he provided several different \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nexplanations about the outcome of the case, including stating at the hearing that he pled \nno contest to these felony charges. Regardless of reason or outcome, or whether he was \nformally charged, prosecuted, or convicted, this incident creates an ongoing security \nconcern and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He also \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to find that there has been successful rehabilitation, or \nmitigation by the passage of time or other factors. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nThe SOR cross-alleges the Guideline J allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) and the \nGuideline F failure to file federal and state tax return allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.e). \nThe security concern applicable in this case under AG \u00b6 16 is: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nI find that AG \u00b6 16(c) is established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 2.c, and 2.e. SOR \u00b6 1.c was found for \nApplicant. In the Guideline J analysis, I found that enough time had passed to mitigate \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, and that analysis similarly applies here. The Government did not allege \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file federal or state taxes as criminal conduct concerns, and financial \nconsiderations are not normally personal conduct concerns. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. In the Guideline J analysis, I found that \nthis allegation was not mitigated, it creates an ongoing security concern, and it casts doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Those findings also \napply here in the analysis of the personal conduct security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, F, and E in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate all of the security concerns under Guidelines J, F, and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.p: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

He did not admit or deny SOR 1.i, 2.a and 2.b, but rather provided explanations. I will consider his response as denials. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old. He served in the military from 1988 to 1990 and received a hardship discharge, which was honorable. He reenlisted in December 2001 and served in combat in Iraq from April 2003 to November 2003. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. He married in 1996 and divorced in 2012. He has a child from a previous relationship and two children from the marriage. His youngest child has special needs, and Applicant provides financial support to her as needed. He and his ex-wife share guardianship over her. He remarried in June 2021. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since 2008 and has held a security clearance since then. He stated that he has earned approximately $67,000 a year since 2008 with minimal raises.

I will \nconsider his response as denials. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He served in the military from 1988 to 1990 and received \na hardship discharge, which was honorable. He reenlisted in December 2001 and served \nin combat in Iraq from April 2003 to November 2003. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2007. He married in 1996 and divorced in 2012. He has a child from a previous \nrelationship and two children from the marriage. His youngest child has special needs, \nand Applicant provides financial support to her as needed. He and his ex-wife share \nguardianship over her. He remarried in June 2021. He has worked for his current \nemployer, a federal contractor, since 2008 and has held a security clearance since then. \nHe stated that he has earned approximately $67,000 a year since 2008 with minimal \nraises. During his marriage to his first wife, she earned about $65,000 until she became \nunemployed for a period after their divorce. His second wife earns approximately \n$140,000 annually. (Tr. 16-29; GE 1) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s tour in Iraq, he was injured when he leaped from his vehicle to \navoid an attack on his convoy. He cracked his femur and had muscle tears in his knees. \nHe completed his enlistment in December 2004 and received an honorable discharge. In \n2009, he was awarded a Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA) disability rating of 30%. He received about \n$500 a month from the VA. He resubmitted a VA claim in August 2022 with a diagnosis \nof post-traumatic stress disorder and was awarded a 100% disability rating in December \n2022. He receives $4,109 a month for his VA disability. (Tr 21-26; AE B) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had delinquent debts that included approximately \n$104,137 of delinquent student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d). He began taking out student \nloans when he was attending college in 1995. He testified that he made consistent \npayments but after he got married the first time, he got behind and requested a deferment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt some point, he stopped attending college but went back in 2005 and took out additional \nloans. He said he was paying the loans through the school while he was attending. Once \nhe graduated in 2007, he said he continued paying the loans. In 2009, when he began to \nreceive VA disability payments, he said he used those funds to pay his student loans. He \nstated he continued to pay the student loans until his 2012 divorce. He then contacted \nthe student loan creditor to obtain a deferment or an income-based payment plan. He \nsaid he got the plan and started to pay it but then his divorce, child support and his ex-\nwife\u2019s unemployment impacted his finances. He also stated in his SOR answer that the \ninterest rate on his mortgage increased due to the housing crisis and that increased his \nmortgage payments. Apparently, he had an adjustable-rate mortgage. (Tr. 39-64; SOR \nanswer) \nApplicant said he contacted the student loan creditor and requested another \ndeferment until he could make consistent payments. When the deferment expired, he \nwould get a payment plan, make payments for a few months, then stop due to other \nfinancial priorities, such as his children\u2019s medical and other needs. He said about 65% of \nhis income was going for child support and his mortgage. In 2016, his oldest child \ngraduated from high school, and he was not required to pay child support for him. \nAlthough his child support decreased by half, he used this money to help with his child\u2019s \ncollege expenses and other bills. His loans were in default and in 2020 were placed in a \ndeferment status under the CARES Act due to the pandemic. He testified that from 2016 \nto 2020, he made sporadic payments toward his student loan debts. In his SOR answer, \nhe attributed his inability to pay his student loans to having a young family, a new \nmortgage, and interest rates increasing on his mortgage. (Tr. 39-64) \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that when his student loans were deferred due \nto the pandemic in 2020, it allowed him to catch up on his other financial obligations. In \nhis answer, he stated that he intended to apply for the \u201cFresh Start\u201d program, which he \ndid in December 2022. In July 2023, his VA disability was increased to 100% and the total \namount he owed for federal student loans were discharged due to his disability status. \nThe student loans are resolved. (Tr. 39-64; AE B) \nApplicant disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($4,433). He explained in 2017 the roof \nof his house was damaged in a storm. An unsolicited person came to his house asking to \nrepair his roof. Applicant and the person agreed an estimate would be provided but he \nclearly told the person that he was not agreeing to contract with the company. He provided \nApplicant an estimate and there was no further contact with this salesperson or the \ncompany. They did not do any work for Applicant. In late 2017, he was contacted by the \ncompany that provided an estimate and it demanded payment. He told them he did not \nowe any debt to them. He was told he needed to pay them for their estimate, or they \nwould send the debt to a collection company. Applicant refused. When he saw the debt \non his credit bureau account, he contacted the collector and asked them to provide him \nwith a copy of a signed contract. They were unable to produce a signed contract and \nremoved the debt from his account. Applicant provided documents to substantiate his \nactions. This debt is resolved.

He \ntestified that this credit card became delinquent in approximately 2013 or 2014. A \njudgment was entered against Applicant for the balance owed on the debt. In February \n2022, the creditor agreed to settle the judgment for less than the amount owed ($2,049). \nApplicant was able to pay the settlement after he sold his house in 2021, as detailed \nbelow. In his post-hearing statement, he said he was unaware of the debt until he received \na letter from a debt collector. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 90-93; AE C, D) \nDuring his hearing, Applicant was asked if he filed and paid his federal and state \ntaxes on time, and he confirmed he filed the returns on time. He said he has a federal \nincome tax debt for 2013 (approximately $9,000) and he also owes approximately $6,000 \nfor tax years 2014 and 2015. He did not pay the taxes because he did not have the money. \nHe had been a 1099 employee in addition to his regular employment. He stated that the \nIRS withheld any refunds he may have been entitled to in subsequent tax years and \napplied them to his delinquent balance. At the time of his hearing, he had not made any \nindependent payments towards these tax debts. He testified that he received notifications \nfrom the IRS advising him of how to address his delinquent tax debts. It also told him the \nIRS would withhold any refunds he may be entitled to. Prior to his hearing, he had not \ncontacted the IRS to make any payment arrangements and did not have a payment plan. \n(Tr. 69-83, 96-97) \nApplicant further testified that in 2020 he contacted the IRS because he wanted to \nfind out why a tax return had been rejected. He was told he could request tax transcripts \nfrom their website. He said when he went on the website, he found out his 2013 tax debt \nhad been reduced when his refunds were applied to the balance, and he had a balance \nowed of about $9,000. He explained when he sold his house, he used the profit for other \nexpenses and did not prioritize his student loans or income tax debt. (Tr. 72-78) \nApplicant testified that he sold his house in June 2021. He received approximately \n$105,000 profit from the sale. He said it was his intention to obtain a payment plan at that \ntime to repay his student loan debt. He said he used about $35,000 to pay other debts he \nowed but were not delinquent. He paid property taxes that were three years in arrears for \nproperty he owns in another state. He said he did not have the money to pay these taxes \nwhen due. He estimated he owed about $1,400 on one parcel of land and $900 on \nanother. His wife had medical bills that were not covered by insurance, and they were \nabout $15,000 to $20,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. He also decided to invest in his \nuncle\u2019s start-up business. He referred to it as his retirement savings. He invested about \n$25,000 in it. He stated that by December 2022 he had about $15,000 remaining from the \nprofit on the sale of his house. He did not use any of the profits from the sale of his home \nto make payments at the time on his delinquent federal income taxes. Applicant currently \nhas approximately $1,300 in his bank accounts. (Tr. 64-78, 82) \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 2021 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed \nhe took foreign trips to the Bahamas in 2014, 2016 and 2019 to visit his family and his \n2019 trip was to attend his grandmother\u2019s funeral.

(AE F, G) \nI find there is substantial evidence to conclude Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose his delinquent federal income tax debts on his SCA. I find because there was \nconfusion due to the pandemic regarding the technical status of Applicant\u2019s student loans, \nthe evidence is insufficient to conclude he deliberately failed to disclose their prior default \nstatus. I also find that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant was aware \nhe had a delinquent credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) owed until he was notified by the \ncollection company. I do not have evidence that he was aware of this debt prior to \ncompleting the September 2021 SCA. His statement on the SCA that all of his debts were \npaid in full was misleading and false. \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant stated his 2021 federal income tax return \nhas been electronically filed. He explained that this was the year he remarried, and his \nwife filed as single because they did not marry until June. He filed as married filing \nseparately. The IRS was unable to process the return. He stated he has now refiled as \nsingle, and the return was accepted, and it is waiting to be processed. He provided his \ntax year 2021 transcript which reflects that as of February 8, 2024, the return had not \nbeen filed. It also notes Applicant received the government\u2019s tax relief credit of $1,400 in \nMarch 2021 and a notice was issued in April 2021. He did not provide any documentary \nproof that his 2021 federal income tax return was filed. However, I believe Applicant filed \nhis 2021 income tax return after his hearing. (AE K) \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided a document from the IRS showing a payment of \n$2,980 was pending as of February 21, 2024.

He also provided an IRS \ninstallment agreement signed on February 27, 2024, which provides that $420 monthly \npayments would begin in April 2024.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant had delinquent student loans totaling more than $100,000. He also had \nother delinquent debts. He failed to timely file his 2021 federal income tax return and \nowes delinquent federal income taxes from 2013, 2014, and 2015. Although, he had some \nevents that impacted his ability to pay his taxes, he also made a substantial profit on the \nsale of his home and did not use any of the profits to pay his taxes. He took foreign trips \nfor vacation and invested in his uncle\u2019s business ($25,000) which shows he had the \nresources and chose not to pay his tax debt. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements.\nApplicant provided  proof  that his student  loan  debts  were  resolved  when  he \nreceived a  1 00% VA d isability rating in  2022. He provided d ocuments to sh\n ow he d isputed  \nthe d ebt in SOR \u00b6 1.de a nd it  has been reso\n \nlved. A G \u00b6 2 0(e) applies to th is debt. He \n \nalso  \nprovided  documents  to  show he  settled  a  judgment  entered a gainst him  in 2022 fo\n r a  \ncredit card d ebt (SOR \n \n\u00b6 1 .f) that h ad b een d elinquent since 2 013 o r 2014. Although t he  \ndebt is \n resolved, I  cannot find A G \u00b6 2 0(d) applies because se\n ttling a  d ebt after a j udgment  \nis entered is not considered a  good-faith e ffort.  \nOf  greatest concern is that Applicant failed  to  pay his delinquent taxes. He \nexplained  he  was unable to  pay the  debts because \n \nhe \n \nwas taking \n \ncare of his family,  \ntheir medical needs,  child support, his mortgage \n \npayments  had increased, his special  \nneeds  child \n \nhad expenses, \n \nand his ex-wife \n \nwas unemployed \n \n \nfor a  period after \n \ntheir  \ndivorce.  These \n \n are all conditions  beyond his control.  For  the full application \n \n \n of AG  \n\u00b6 20(b), Applicant must \n \nhave \n \nacted responsibly \n \nunder \n \nthe circumstances. Although \n \n \nfor  a  \nperiod  of  time he may \n \n have had \n \nlimited resources \n \nto fully pay his  tax \n \ndebt, he did not  \ncontact \n \n the IRS \n \nto \n make an  attempt to \n  establish a repayment \n \nplan until \n \nafter  his hearing. \n \n \nHe relied  on  refunds from subsequent \n \ntax \n \nyears \n \nto \n \nbe applied to his delinquent \n \n \nbalances  owed. In  2021, \n \nhe received  a substantial \n \n \nprofit from the sale \n \nof  his  house. \n \n He  \nused the profit to pay \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nother debts and invest  in his uncle\u2019s business. In  addition, he had the resources to travel \noverseas  to  visit family in 2014  and  2016. His  trip  in 2019  was  to  attend a  family funeral. \nHe took vacations to  Mexico in 2018, 2020,  and  2021, and  a  trip  to  Costa  Rica  also in \n2021.  Applicant had  legitimate  issues that were  beyond  his control, but he  also made \nfinancial  choices that  were  within  his control  and  did not  act  responsibly  under histhe \ncircumstances, which included  not paying  his  delinquent income  taxes. I  find  AG  \u00b6 20(b) \nonly partially applies because he did not act responsibly.  \nApplicant paid his 2014 delinquent taxes after his hearing. He still has a tax debt \nfor tax years 2013 and 2015. He initiated an installment agreement with the IRS in late \nFebruary 2024 that will begin in April 2024. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. I find AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \napply because his actions to resolve his delinquent tax debts occurred after his hearing. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \nA  person  who  fails repeatedly  to  fulfill his  or her legal obligations does  not  \ndemonstrate  the  high  degree  of good  judgment and  reliability required  of those  granted  \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case  No. 15-00216  at 4 (App. Bd. Oct.  24, 2016),  \nciting  Cafeteria  &  Restaurant Workers Union  Local 473  v. McElroy,  284  F.2d  173, 183  \n(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d,  367  U.S.  886  (1961). Applicant\u2019s failure to  address his tax issues  \nuntil after his hearing  \u201cdoes not  reflect  the  voluntary compliance  of  rules and  regulations  \nexpected  of someone  entrusted  with  the  nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d  ISCR  Case  No.  14-05794  at  7  \n(App. Bd. July 7, 2016.) Although  there is some  evidence  of mitigation, it is insufficient to  \nfully mitigate  the  security concerns raised  by Applicant\u2019s failure to  timely pay his income  \ntaxes.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose on his September 2021 SCA that he owed \ndelinquent federal income taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015. I did not find his \nexplanations credible regarding these matters. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAs noted above, I found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding his failure to disclose his \ndelinquent student loans and credit card debt. I find in his favor on SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose he owed federal income taxes from tax \nyears 2014 and 2015. He stated in his SCA that \u201cI have paid all debts in full.\u201d This \nstatement is misleading and false. He was aware that he still owed the IRS for his taxes, \nand they were not paid in full. His failure to put the government on notice as to his tax \nissues is not a minor offense. He had an opportunity during his background investigation \nto tell the government investigator about his delinquent tax debt but did not. His actions \nwere not minor. The security clearance process relies on those seeking a clearance to be \nhonest and forthcoming. Applicant failed to do so, which casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I have considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice in combat and that he is a disabled veteran. I have also considered the impact his \nspecial needs child has on his finances, along with all of the other matters he raised. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.i:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 67 years old. He was married from 1976 through 1981 and again from 1992 through 2007 with both relationships ending in divorce. He has three adult children. He served in the Marine Corps from 1974 through 1977 and received an honorable discharge. (GX 1-2; Tr. 25-28) From about February 2001 through October 2017, Applicant served as a police officer for a municipality. After about four months of unemployment, he started with his current, sponsoring employer in March 2018 as a full-time security guard. He has not previously held a security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 28-30) The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years (TYs) 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). The allegations are established by his admissions, his responses to interrogatories, and by various IRS and state tax account transcripts. Applicant testified that, prior to his divorce in 2007, his wife handled their tax filings. After the divorce, he struggled to maintain his financial and tax obligations. He testified that, when he was able to file, he would use a tax preparer and submit federal and state returns at the same time. (Tr. 44-54, 77-86) Applicant\u2019s first k",

During the hearing, Department Counsel \noffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7. Applicant testified and submitted \nexhibits (AX) A through I. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I held the record \nopen until October 24, 2023, to allow both parties the opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments. Applicant timely submitted additional documents that I marked as AX J \nthough O and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nOctober 12, 2023. The record closed on October 24, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 67 years old. He was married from 1976 through 1981 and again \nfrom 1992 through 2007 with both relationships ending in divorce. He has three adult \nchildren. He served in the Marine Corps from 1974 through 1977 and received an \nhonorable discharge. (GX 1-2; Tr. 25-28) \nFrom about February 2001 through October 2017, Applicant served as a police \nofficer for a municipality. After about four months of unemployment, he started with his \ncurrent, sponsoring employer in March 2018 as a full-time security guard. He has not \npreviously held a security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 28-30) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years (TYs) 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). The \nallegations are established by his admissions, his responses to interrogatories, and by \nvarious IRS and state tax account transcripts. \nApplicant testified that, prior to his divorce in 2007, his wife handled their tax \nfilings. After the divorce, he struggled to maintain his financial and tax obligations. He \ntestified that, when he was able to file, he would use a tax preparer and submit federal \nand state returns at the same time. (Tr. 44-54, 77-86) \nApplicant\u2019s first known tax delinquency came in 2011. Unable to pay his \nmortgage and issue payments on a payday loan, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He \nfiled his TY 2011 federal return late, but did not recall the date. Details about Applicant\u2019s \nTY 2012 filings are also uncertain and he could not recall whether a tax debt was part of \nhis bankruptcy payments. He completed his bankruptcy obligations, and it was \ndischarged in 2014. (GX 1-3; Tr. 31, 44-46) \nAn IRS account transcript for TY 2013 shows that a return was filed in May 2014 \nand that Applicant was assessed penalties for the late filing and late payment.

However, the tax debt was not resolved until \npayments occurred from December 2021 through March 2022. (GX 3; Tr. 49) \nIn his July 2022 response to interrogatories, Applicant detailed that he had not \nfiled his federal and state tax returns for TYs 2014, 2016 and 2017, but stated his intent \nto do so that month. He testified that the federal and state returns for all three years \nwere filed in about July 2022. He did not provide documentary evidence that he filed the \nfederal returns. However, records show that the state returns for these tax years were \nfiled in 2022 and 2023. In September 2023, the state issued a notice of assessment \nstating that Applicant owed an additional $692 in taxes for TYs 2014 and 2016. He \npromptly paid this debt. The state also issued a notice denying Applicant a refund for \nTY 2017 because the filing was received more than three years after it was due. \n(GX 3-5; AX A-C, G-M; Tr. 51-57, 68-71) \nAn IRS account transcript reflects that Applicant filed his TY 2015 return in \nOctober 2016 and was assessed penalties for the late filing and late payment. At the \ntime of the filing, Applicant owed about $497. However, Applicant did not complete \npayments on that debt until November 2021. Records do not reflect when the state filing \noccurred, but do indicate that the state taxes for TY 2015 were paid. (GX 3; AX J; \nTr. 59) \nApplicant testified that he filed his federal and state TY 2018 returns in \nSeptember 2023. He did not provide documentary evidence that he filed the federal \nreturn. However, state records confirm that the state return was filed and taxes paid in \nSeptember 2023. (GX 3, 6; AX D, N; Tr. 73-74) \nApplicant filed his TY 2019 federal and state returns on time. He received a \npenalty from the IRS for not prepaying his taxes, but the taxes have since been paid. He \nfiled his TY 2020 federal and state returns late, in June 2021. He was assessed \npenalties for the late filing of his federal return and late payment. All federal and state \ntaxes for TY 2020 were paid. (GX 3, 7; AX J; Tr. 76-78) \nAs of May 20, 2022, an IRS account transcript shows that Applicant had not filed \nhis TY 2021 federal return. Applicant testified that he filed his federal and state returns \nin September 2022. He did not provide documentary evidence that he filed the federal \nreturn. However, state records show that the state tax filing and payment occurred in \nSeptember 2022. (GX 3, 7; AX E; Tr. 77-79) \nApplicant testified that he filed his TY 2022 federal and state returns in February \n2023 and paid the taxes that were due. He stated it was his intent to timely file and pay \nhis obligations in the future. (Tr. 80-81) \nApplicant detailed that, after the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, his financial difficulties \ncontinued. In 2018, the mortgage account on his home went into foreclosure and he lost \nthe property. Financial difficulties over the years made him reluctant, at times, to file his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntax returns because he could not afford to pay a tax preparer or pay the taxes that were \nlikely due. (GX 1-2; Tr. 82-96) \nIn his April 2018 SCA, Applicant stated that \u201cprocrastination\u201d also played a part in \nthe escalation of his tax problems, but that he had \u201cfull intentions\u201d of resolving the \nfilings. He reiterated these intentions during his April 2019 background interview. At \nhearing, Applicant testified that the security investigation had \u201clit a fire\u201d for him to resolve \nhis tax and financial circumstances. Additionally, since starting with his current \nemployer, his financial circumstances have significantly improved, and he believes he is \nin a much better position to handle his future financial and tax obligations. (GX 1-2; \nTr. 39-42, 91-96) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes one condition that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19 potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TYs \n2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere are several pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns for several tax years \nas alleged in the SOR. He referenced several reasons for his delay, including his \ndivorce in 2007, an extended period of financial difficulties as well as his own \nprocrastination. Although he stated in his April 2018 SCA, and again during his April \n2019 background interview, that he was committed to resolving his tax issues, the \ndelayed filings continued through at least TY 2021. \nWhile difficulty in meeting financial obligations may force an applicant to choose \nthe order in which he or she addresses unpaid debts, they do not provide a plausible \nexcuse for failing to meet an important legal requirement, such as filing returns when \ndue. ISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017) Failure to file tax returns \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem complying with well-established governmental \nrules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002) \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s tax concerns were not limited to TYs 2014, 2016, 2017, \n2018 and 2021. He also filed his TYs 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2020 returns late. These \nadditional tax issues were not alleged in the SOR. However, they establish a history of \nnon-compliance with tax obligations that undercut assertions of mitigation, since his tax \nproblems are recent. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has stated that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, this does not preclude careful \nconsideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax \nreturns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing a \n\u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s \nwell that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation). \nApplicant testified that all of his delinquent tax returns have since been filed and \nthat his TY 2022 tax returns were filed and paid early. He only provided limited \ndocumentary evidence in support of these claims. However, even if it were established \nthat all of the returns were filed, his long-term procrastination regarding his federal and \nstate income tax obligations continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not provided sufficient evidence that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances or established that he will be able to \nmaintain compliance with his future tax obligations. None of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions are fully applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nFollowing his divorce in 2007, Applicant experienced an extended period of \nfinancial difficulty that led to his filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2011 and continued \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nto include a foreclosure and loss of his home in 2018. During this period, Applicant \ndelayed filing several years of tax returns, in part, because he could not afford filing \nassistance and out of fear of the tax bill. \nSince starting with his current employer in March 2018, Applicant\u2019s financial \nissues have resolved. However, his tax issues continued to include TY 2021. Although \nhe testified that he has resolved all of his tax issues, and intends to continue to do so in \nthe future, he has failed to establish a track record of tax compliance. His struggles to \nmeet this annual obligation raise unmitigated questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn December 20, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 9, 2024. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January \n29, 2024.

He \nrequested the record remain open to allow him an opportunity to provide additional \nevidence. The record remained open until March 26, 2024. The SOR amendment is \nincluded in Hearing Exhibit I. The SOR was amended as follows: \n1.c. You failed to timely file, as required, Federal tax returns for at least tax \nyears 2015, 2016, and 2017. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and provided explanations for the \nallegation in \u00b6 1.b but failed to admit or deny it. I will consider his response to SOR \u00b6 1.b \nas a denial. I have incorporated his explanations and admissions into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He earned an associate degree. He has completed \nnumerous certifications for various technical programs and completed various security \ntraining programs. He married in 2008 and has two children, ages 12 and 9. He has \nworked for his current employer for about eight years. He holds a top-secret clearance \nwith access to sensitive compartmented information. (Tr. 18-22; GE 1; AE I, J) \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 federal income tax \nreturns. He failed to timely file his 2014 through 2017 state income tax returns. He \ndisclosed this information on his January 2020 security clearance application. He was \ninterviewed by a government investigator in June 2020 and explained he failed to timely \nfile his federal and state income tax returns because in previous years he had received \nrefunds, and he was lazy in filing the returns. (Tr. 22, 41; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, C, D, E) \nIn April 2019, Applicant timely filed his 2018 federal and state income tax returns \nand also filed his delinquent 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 returns. He contacted a \ncommercial tax preparer and had them prepare the federal and state tax returns. They \nfiled his 2016, 2017, and 2018 federal and state returns electronically. He did not owe \ntaxes for these tax years. The tax preparer was unable to file the 2014 and 2015 federal \nand state returns electronically due to their age. Applicant credibly testified that he mailed \nthe 2014 and 2015 federal and state tax returns to the IRS and his state tax office.

He did not keep a hard copy of the 2014 return and his \ntax preparer only keeps copies for a limited number of years. He testified he believes he \nmailed both returns at the same time. Applicant provided a wage and earning statement \nfrom the IRS for tax year 2014. Tax transcripts for 2015, 2016, and 2017 show he was \nentitled to a refund each year, and he did not owe federal income taxes. Based on the \nevidence that his 2014 state income tax return was filed, I find the evidence is sufficient \nto conclude his 2014 federal tax return was also filed. He was told by the tax preparer he \nwas entitled to receive a refund for his 2014 taxes but forfeited it because he did not file \nwithin three years of the required date. (Tr. 23-31, 41-46; GE 3; AE A, B, C, D, E) \nApplicant provided documents from his state tax office that reports he owed state \nincome taxes for tax year 2014, which also included penalties and interest. In 2019, he \nentered into an installment agreement to pay the 2014 taxes and made a couple monthly \npayments. When the state completed the review of the delinquent returns for 2015, 2016, \nand 2017, along with his 2018 return, it determined he was entitled to refunds for those \nyears. The state tax office applied the refunds to the total balance owed. After this \napplication of refunds, there are no delinquent state income taxes owed as of January \n2023. (Tr. 31-39, 50-55, 62-66; AE E, F) \nApplicant was questioned about why he failed to timely file his federal and state\nincome tax returns and what prompted him finally to do so. He explained that when he \nwas applying to participate in a special project that required him to complete a new \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), he told his facility security officer about his \ndelinquent tax returns. He was advised to take care of the matter, which he did. (Tr. 39-\n40, 55-56) \n \nApplicant further explained that he believed because he likely was to receive a \nrefund for each tax year that he was not hurting anyone by not filing his tax returns on \ntime. He acknowledges what he did was a mistake. Applicant testified that he now has an \nappreciation for the importance of filing his income tax returns as required by law. He \napologized and took full responsibility for his conduct. He has timely filed all subsequent \nyears\u2019 federal and state income tax returns and received refunds. Applicant has no \nfinancial delinquencies or other financial problems. (Tr. 39-40, 58 AE G) \nApplicant provided evidence of awards and recognition he received, along with \nperformance evaluations. He provided character letters in which he is described as \nreliable, supportive, meticulous, honest, hardworking, qualified, and dedicated. He is a \nleader who willingly trains other and is committed to the accomplishment of the mission. \n(AE N, O, P, Q) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and \nother qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2014 through 2017 federal income tax returns. He \nfailed to timely file his 2014 through 2017 state income tax returns. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant filed his 2014 through 2017 federal and state income tax returns in April \n2019. He did not owe federal income taxes for those years. He resolved his 2014 state \ntax debt through the application of subsequent tax years refunds and a couple installment \npayments. I have considered that Applicant failed to comply with the rules and regulations \npertaining to tax filings. I have considered that because he had consistently received \nrefunds, he was lazy and did not fulfill his legal obligation. Applicant resolved his \ndelinquent tax filings and state tax debt before he received the SOR. He was unable to \nprovide his 2014 federal income tax transcript, but I am confident that he filed the return \nbased on his state tax return. Applicant has timely filed his federal and state income tax \nreturns since 2018. I believe future issues regarding his income tax returns are unlikely \nto recur. He has resolved his tax issues. I believe he has learned an important lesson and \nwill be diligent regarding his legal responsibilities in the future. The above mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 10, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J (criminal \nconduct), Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse), Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations), and Guideline E (personal conduct).

Applicant disputed he had a shirt wrapped around his hand and stated he \npunched the other individual in self-defense after that individual approached and put his \nhand on him. He acknowledged he ran away after doing so. When the officers found him \na few blocks away, he admitted his actions and was arrested.

(Tr. 31-45; GE 2, 10, 14) \nIn April 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while impaired by \nalcohol (DWI). He consumed alcohol when he was partying with friends at a nightclub. As \nhe was driving home, he was pulled over by a state trooper. The trooper smelled alcohol \non his breath and administered a sobriety test, which he failed. He was arrested and taken \nto the police station where he was given a breathalyzer test and registered a blood alcohol \ncontent (BAC) of .8%. He admits he was driving drunk.

He was fined $800, \nplaced on supervised probation from September 2015 until September 2016, ordered to \nabstain from drugs and alcohol, and required to take Mothers Against Drunk Driving \n(MADD) and drug and alcohol awareness classes. He maintained he complied with the \nterms of his probation and refrained from drugs and alcohol while on probation because \nhe was subject to random drug tests by his then-employer as well as his probation officer. \nHe has never received an alcohol-related diagnosis. Since this incident, he estimated he \nhas continued to drive while intoxicated approximately five times yearly, which he \nacknowledged demonstrated poor judgment.

He consented to a search of the car and the police found heroin \nand a firearm, which he denied were his. (Tr. 15-16, 52-67, 94-95; GE 1-2, 5, 14) \nApplicant was arrested since he was the driver of the car and possessed the car \nkeys. He was taken to the police station, denied bail at his first court hearing, and held for \n30 days.

In addition, the transcripts reflect Applicant only made a one-time payment of $70 \nto the IRS in January 2023, for tax year 2018. Those same transcripts reflect he owed \n$6,666 and $1,514 for tax years 2018 and 2020, respectively. He acknowledged he had \nnot made any payments toward his outstanding state taxes.

(Tr. 26-27, 89-97; GE 1-3, 7-8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of \u201ccompromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following disqualifying condition relevant: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has a history of criminal involvement from 2010 to 2021. AG \u00b6 31(b) is \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal involvement from 2010 to 2021 continues to raise doubts about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Although he ultimately received PBJ for the \ncharges in 2010, 2013, and 2015, he admits he engaged in the underlying criminal \nconduct. He also admits he has continued to drive while intoxicated, approximately five \ntimes yearly, despite his 2015 DWI charge and related probation. In addition, while the \ncharges from 2020 were nolle prosequi, his underlying conduct and his related 2021 \narrest for violating the terms of his house arrest reflect poor judgment. He needs more \ntime to show he has matured and learned from his poor decisions. I find that not enough \ntime has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior and without recurrence of criminal \nactivity, and it continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from October 2009 to October \n2019, excluding the period when he was on probation for his DWI from September 2015 \nto September 2016. He was also arrested and charged with drug-related offenses in June \n2020 after police found heroin and a firearm, which he denied were his, in the car he had \nbeen driving. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: . . . \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts.  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant stated he does not associate with individuals who use illegal drugs. He \nalso stated he closed the chapter in his life wherein he used marijuana, and he has no \nintention of using marijuana or illegal drugs in the future. He did not provide a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. As \ndiscussed in my analysis under Guideline J, while the charges from 2020 were nolle \nprosequi, his underlying conduct reflects poor judgment. His use of marijuana over the \ncourse of nine years and his conduct underlying his 2020 drug-related charges continue \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \n26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are not established. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. He also failed to file his \nrelevant federal and state income tax returns and pay his outstanding federal and state \ntaxes, as required. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. Although the information reflected in the \nJune 2022 IRS tax account transcript about Applicant\u2019s wages for tax year 2019 is \ninaccurate, that transcript nonetheless reflects he filed his federal income tax return for \nthat tax year in May 2020. As such, I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies only to his filed federal \nincome tax return for tax year 2019, and I find that part of SOR \u00b6 3.a in his favor. \nApplicant has not submitted evidence of responsible conduct for his remaining \nfinancial issues. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims he has filed \nhis federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2017 and 2021, or his state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2021. Other than his one-time payment of \n$70 to the IRS in January 2023 for tax year 2018, he has not made any other efforts to \nresolve his outstanding taxes. He did not provide documentation to corroborate any of his \nclaims of payment or resolution for his remaining SOR debts, to include his student loans. \nWhile the January 2023 CBR reflects his student loans were no longer delinquent, he \nacknowledged he had not made any payments toward them and he was past due. He \nalso did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims that he disputed the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.f, 3.h, and 3.i. He has not received financial counseling. He needs more time \nto establish he has his finances under control.

Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to . . . ;  \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the\nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs previously indicated, Applicant\u2019s conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 2.a, and 3.a-3.b is \ncross-alleged under Guideline E as SOR \u00b6 4.b. I addressed that conduct, which is \nsufficient for an adverse determination, in my analyses under Guidelines J, H, and F, \nabove. As such, AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 4.b and I find that allegation in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant threatened physical harm to his child\u2019s mother on several occasions \nbetween 2017 and 2020, and during one such occasion he was escorted by security off \nher work site. His conduct raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(1), 16(d)(2), and 16(e)(1) apply to SOR \u00b6 4.a. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following relevant conditions that could mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant has not engaged in similar such conduct since 2020, and he stated that \nhe and his child\u2019s mother have a good co-parenting relationship and he has visitation \nrights with his child. However, his problematic conduct with his child\u2019s mother between \n2017 and 2020 was not minor or infrequent, did not happen under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. While he acknowledged his behavior, he has not \ndemonstrated he has obtained counseling or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \ncircumstances that led to it and that it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not \napply to SOR \u00b6 4.a. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, H, F, and \nE in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the criminal conduct, drug involvement and substance misuse, \nfinancial considerations, and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant, in part (use of \nmarijuana while prohibited by his \nprobation for SOR \u00b6 1.d), and \nAgainst Applicant, in part (use of \nmarijuana, with varying frequency, \nfrom October 2009 to October \n2019) \nSubparagraph 2:b \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant, in part (filed federal \nincome tax return for tax year \n2019), and Against Applicant, in \npart (failure to file federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2012 to \n2017 and 2021) \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.b: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is 23 years old. Born in Ghana, he arrived in the United States with his \nparents in 2006 at the age of six. He attended schools in the United States and became \na naturalized U.S. citizen in 2016 at age 16. \nApplicant received his high school diploma in May 2018. He attended an out-of\u00ad\nstate college after graduation from May 2018 to about December 2019, until he withdrew \nfrom school as a result of the arrest alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c discussed below. In January \n2020, he enrolled in a different college. In May 2023, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin business management and information systems. Applicant has never been married and \nhas no children. (GE 1; and Tr. 17-20) \nSince August 2022, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as an \nadministrative support technician. His duties involve work accomplished on a federal \ninstallation. He previously held an interim secret security clearance, which was removed \nwhen he did not initially clear. In November 2023, he was placed in an administrative \nleave status pending the outcome of this adjudication process. (Tr. 17-20) \nApplicant was raised in State 1. In October 2019, while attending a college in State \n2, he was arrested by campus police for possession of marijuana after marijuana was \nfound in his dorm room. His arrest was then processed by local police, and he later \nappeared in court. Applicant testified that all charges were subsequently dropped. (GE 1 \nand GE 2; and Tr. 17-33) \nAs a result of the arrest, however, Applicant faced discipline from college officials. \nHe testified he was given the option to either leave the university voluntarily within a week, \nor risk defending himself before a college disciplinary board where he faced formal \nexpulsion and an unfavorable student record. He chose the former and signed a voluntary \npermanent separation from the college in November 2019. As a result, he was banned \nfrom all campuses and unable to re-enroll. (GE 2 at 8; Tr. 26-30) As discussed above, \nApplicant soon enrolled in college elsewhere, and eventually earned his degree. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his May 2022 SCA, he did not disclose any prior drug \ninvolvement; nor did he disclose his 2019 arrest for marijuana possession. Specifically, \nhe answered \u201cno\u201d in response to two questions in Section 23, Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug \nActivity, which asked whether, in the last seven years, Applicant had: (1) illegally used \nany drugs or controlled substances; and (2) illegally purchased, received, handled, etc., \nany drug or controlled substance. He also answered \u201cno\u201d in response to a question in \nSection 22, Police Record, which asked whether he had ever been charged with an \noffense involving alcohol or drugs. (GE 1 pp. 27-29) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 2.a - 2.c) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2022 interview with DOD investigators, authenticated in \nOctober 2022, he disclosed he first used marijuana in May 2018, and that he last used it \nin June 2022, prior to his DOD interview. He also disclosed he acquired the marijuana by \neither purchasing it from multiple dealers or receiving it as a gift from others. (GE 2 at 10; \nTr. at 26) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) \nIn the hearing Applicant testified he subsequently used marijuana twice after his \nJune 2022 background interview: in October 2022 before completing his response to \ninterrogatories; and in December 2022. This last use he stated was due to the depression \nand sadness he felt after the death of his grandmother with whom he enjoyed a close \nrelationship. His December 2022 marijuana use occurred after the issuance date of the \nSOR, November 9, 2022, though it is unclear if Applicant actually received it beforehand. \nHe testified that December 2022 was the last time he used marijuana, and that he has no \nfuture intent to use it. (Tr. 23-29, 40-45) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted he deliberately falsified his answers to the \nabove SCA questions because he was concerned that admitting his illegal drug \ninvolvement, including his drug use, purchase, and his drug-related arrest for possession \nof illegal drugs would hinder his ability to obtain a security clearance. He also testified his \nemployer has a drug-free workplace policy, and that he signed an agreement not to use \nillegal drugs. (Tr. 18-19, 28, 35-36) \nApplicant testified he made the decision to \u201cdo better\u201d after his grandmother \npassed away. His grandmother\u2019s passing and his current job motivated him to graduate \nfrom college and to stop using marijuana. He discussed his feelings of depression with \nhis medical doctor, but was never clinically diagnosed with depression. He also disclosed \nhis use of marijuana to his doctor, but stated he was never prescribed medical marijuana. \nHe used marijuana primarily for recreational purposes. (Tr. 32-34, 41-45) Applicant \nsubmitted two supplemental documents: a personal statement, and a copy of his job offer \nfrom a federal agency, both of which were considered in this case.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence presented in this case establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana before and during college. He continued to use \nmarijuana despite his arrest for possession of marijuana in his college dorm room, \nfollowed by a forced withdrawal from college without the possibility of returning. \nApplicant also continued to use marijuana well after the initiation of the security \nclearance process. He submitted his SCA in May 2022, and used marijuana in June 2022 \njust before his interview with DOD investigators on June 15, 2022. He used marijuana \nagain in October 2022 before completing his response to interrogatories. Finally, he used \nmarijuana in December 2022, which he said was the last time. Applicant\u2019s employer has \na drug-free workplace policy, and as a condition of employment, he signed an agreement \nnot to use illegal drugs. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable here. Applicant \nhas not mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns in this \ncase. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is described in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process \nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he deliberately falsified responses to the above \nSCA questions. He testified he took this action because he was concerned that admitting \nhis illegal drug involvement, including his drug use, purchase, and being arrested for \nillegal drug possession would hinder his ability to obtain a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate\nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to\nrecur. \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(d) are only partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s subsequent \ndiscussion with DOD investigators concerning his drug involvement, including \nhis \nunlisted prior drug use, periodic purchases, and his arrest for drug possession is \ninsufficient to mitigate his personal conduct security concerns. Moreover, these \nsubsequent disclosures to DOD investigators did not amount to a prompt, good-faith effort \nto correct his prior omission in this case. Applicant is credited with abstaining from illegal \ndrug involvement for about a year, but he has not obtained counseling or taken other \nobjective steps to demonstrate he has changed his behavior towards illegal drug \ninvolvement. The evidence in this case leaves me doubts about whether he has overcome \nhis personal conduct security concerns with respect to drug involvement. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not applicable. Comments discussed in Guideline H above also apply \nhere. Applicant exercised extremely poor judgment by continuing to use marijuana. He \nalso falsified multiple questions on his SCA. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and judgment, and demonstrates an unwillingness to comply with federal \nrules and regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all evidence in the \nwhole-person context, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate security concerns under \nGuidelines H (drug involvement and substance misuse) and E (personal conduct). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant admitted that in 2017, \nwhile in the Army, she went to an Army relief organization on post, seeking a loan to help \npay her debts. She received an application from the organization and completed it. The \napplication needed signatures from either her commander or her first sergeant. Neither \nwere available the day Applicant sought the loan. She forged her company commander\u2019s \nsignature on the application form and submitted it. Because she entered the incorrect \nemail address for her commander on the form, the fraudulent nature of the form was \ndiscovered. She then faced an Article 15 UCMJ proceeding before her battalion \ncommander. She was found guilty of forgery and was punished with a one-grade \nreduction in rank and 60 days of extra duties. (Tr. 62-63; GE 3) \nPersonal Conduct \nThe factual circumstances of the forgery allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.a) are described \nabove. In 2019, Applicant was in the Army and placed on \u201cquarters duty\u201d by a physician. \nThis is a designation of a soldier\u2019s place of duty at their home because of medical \ncircumstances. While in this designation, Applicant decided to fly to her home state to see \nher family. She did not seek authorization from her command to travel. After about seven \ndays, she was contacted by her unit and told to report to her regular duty location the next \nday. She told the contacting person that she could not do that because she was in a \ndifferent state. When she returned to her unit, she faced Article 15, UCMJ proceedings \nfrom her commander. She was found guilty of being absent without leave (AWOL) and \nreduced in rank one grade. (Tr. 64-65; GE 3) \nIn March 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with burglary of a habitation, \nassault causing bodily harm, and interference with an emergency request for assistance. \nThe underlying factual circumstances were that Applicant was with a friend who went to \na hotel where her friend\u2019s father was staying with his girlfriend. A dispute over money \narose and all parties engaged in a mutual affray. Applicant admitted stepping on the \ngirlfriend\u2019s cell phone and breaking it.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. She incurred 10 delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $30,000. All but one small debt remain unpaid. She admitted failing \nto timely file her 2020 federal income tax return and forging her commander\u2019s signature \nfor financial gain. I find all disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;    \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and   \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although she paid one \nof the debts, she failed to address the remaining debts, which comprise the greatest \nportion of the overall debt amount. Applicant\u2019s forgery offense happened under unusual \ncircumstances and is unlikely to recur since she is no longer in the Army. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot applicable, except as to SOR \u00b6 1.l. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s divorce from her second spouse was a circumstance beyond \nher control, she did not act responsibly concerning the debts when she failed to follow up \nby contacting her creditors or establish payment plans. While she engaged two credit \nrestoration services, neither proved fruitful. While she recently used the services of a \nfinancial counselor, she failed to show any financial benefit from that action so far. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant presented evidence of recently receiving financial counseling. However, \nthere are no clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. Her \ntrack record to date does not support a good financial picture. She has had financial \ndifficulties for a number of years. Based upon her past history, there is no reason to \nbelieve that she will right her financial ship in the near future. While she did resolve one \ndebt, this action is too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies only to SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nApplicant disputed some debts, but she failed to produce documentation to support \nthe basis of those disputes.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and \n20(f) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b616 and the following potentially applies: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nIn 2017, while in the Army, Applicant forged her commander\u2019s signature in an \nattempt to secure a personal loan. In 2018, while in the Army, she went AWOL by flying \nto her home state when she was restricted, because of medical reasons, to her residence. \nIn 2020, she became involved in a mutual affray that led to criminal charges against her. \nThose charges were ultimately dismissed. All these events lead to questioning Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b616(c) \napplies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nTwo of the allegations occurred in 2017 and 2018, while Applicant was in the Army, \nwhich is no longer the case. The last event occurred in 2020 and all those charges were \ndropped. I find that AG \u00b617(c) substantially applies to all the allegations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, her VA disability, and her divorce. \nHowever, I also considered that she has not adequately addressed her delinquent debt \nand has not brought forward any plans to address the debt even though she recently \nengaged a financial counselor. She has not established a meaningful track record of debt \nmanagement, which causes me to question her ability to resolve her debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered the \nexceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated June \n8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. She mitigated the personal \nconduct concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs: 1.d, 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 25-year-old network administrator (IT) employed by a defense contractor since December 2020. He was born in August 1997. He graduated high school in 2015 and served on active duty from April 2017 until June 2019, when he received a general under honorable conditions discharge. He held a security clearance while on active duty. He married in October 2023. (GE 1; Tr. at 13, 68.) Applicant stated he started drinking when he turned 21. (Tr. at 21-22.; AE E at 3.) He told the government investigator during his security clearance interview the same. (Tr. at 22; GE 2 at 5.) When asked again when he started drinking, he stated \u201cI do not have an exact date, Your Honor, Department Counsel. I do not have an exact date of when I started drinking.\u201d After explaining that an exact date was not required Applicant stated \u201cwhen I joined the military, joined the Navy, that is when I started drinking. It wasn't exactly when I joined, it would have been towards getting to my first duty station at [Installation X], I got with shipmates.\u201d He was not yet 21 based on the date he arrived at his first duty station.

On October 12, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor October 25, 2023. On October 23, 2023, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a notice of \nwithdrawal. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant's \nExhibits (AE) A through AE K, which were admitted without objection. I left the record open \nuntil November 8, 2023. Applicant submitted a release of probation (AE L) and a video (AE \nVideo). The Government did not object to either exhibit. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non November 9, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 25-year-old network administrator (IT) employed by a defense \ncontractor since December 2020. He was born in August 1997. He graduated high school \nin 2015 and served on active duty from April 2017 until June 2019, when he received a \ngeneral under honorable conditions discharge. He held a security clearance while on active \nduty. He married in October 2023. (GE 1; Tr. at 13, 68.) \nApplicant stated he started drinking when he turned 21. (Tr. at 21-22.; AE E at 3.) \nHe told the government investigator during his security clearance interview the same. (Tr. \nat 22; GE 2 at 5.) When asked again when he started drinking, he stated \u201cI do not have an \nexact date, Your Honor, Department Counsel. I do not have an exact date of when I started \ndrinking.\u201d After explaining that an exact date was not required Applicant stated \u201cwhen I \njoined the military, joined the Navy, that is when I started drinking. It wasn't exactly when I \njoined, it would have been towards getting to my first duty station at [Installation X], I got \nwith shipmates.\u201d He was not yet 21 based on the date he arrived at his first duty station. \n(Tr. at 24-25; GE 1.) \nOn New Year\u2019s Eve December 2017, Applicant was celebrating with shipmates at a \nbowling alley. He was drinking rum mixed with soda pop from cups. (Tr. at 22.) He \nconsumed enough alcohol that he does not recall what happened. He learned he had \nbecome belligerent and physical. He was arrested and charged with intoxicated public \ndisturbance, malicious destruction of property, and intoxication endangerment. He went to \ncourt in June 2018 and paid restitution for the items he broke in exchange for the charges \nbeing dropped. (GE 2 at 5.) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and cross alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. \nIn September 2018, he was deployed from his shore command to a ship to provide \nIT support on an upcoming deployment. He became intoxicated while hanging out with \nshipmates around the \u201csmoke pit\u201d located about 500 to 1,000 feet from the ship, which was \nat the pier. (Tr. 34; GE 3.) He was drinking rum and became intoxicated. When he returned \nto the ship, he became belligerent and violent and had to be zipped tied and left to calm \ndown. (GE 3 at 8-9.) He was escorted off the ship and returned to his command at \nInstallation X and in November 2018, he was taken to nonjudicial punishment (NJP) for \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nviolation of Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), drunk and disorderly \nconduct for his conduct in September. He received forfeiture of \u00bd month\u2019s pay for two \nmonths, reduction in rank (suspended for six months), and was required to attend alcohol \nrehabilitation, which he completed. (GE 3 at 1, 2; AE H at 4.) He was informed he would be \nseparated if any further alcohol related incidents occurred. He modified his behavior for a \nperiod of time working out and playing video games and completing his 12 weeks of alcohol \nrehabilitation classes. (Tr. at 39, 42.) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and cross \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. In March 2019, as part of St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations, he \nparticipated in a \u201cbar crawl.\u201d (Tr. at 45.) When he returned to Installation X intoxicated, he \nwas disturbing the barracks and not abiding the direction of the petty officer on duty. He was \nadministratively separated from the Navy following this incident. (Tr. at 46.) \nAfter separating from the Navy, he acknowledged his drinking did pick up. It went \nfrom, \u201cmaybe once a month with buddies to every weekend.\u201d (Tr. at 47.) During the work \nweek his work hours left \u201cno room\u201d to drink, but on the weekends, he drank in excess. (Tr. \nat 47.) About three to four months after being separated from the Navy he met his now wife. \n(Tr. at 47.) \nIn August 2020, Applicant was arrested for police officer assault, resisting arrest, \nobstruction, and operating a vehicle while impaired. He was found guilty of operating a \nvehicle while impaired. The incident occurred after a day on a boat with his then girlfriend \nand his family. He and his stepfather got into a family argument about his life events and \nchoices. (Tr. at 49.) He left \u201cto go cool off\u201d because he was \u201cupset\u201d but he did not realize \nhow impaired he was. (Tr. at 49; GE 4 at 1.) His vehicle left the road and struck a telephone \npole. He struck his head during the accident. When the emergency services arrived, he \nwas being treated when he was grabbed from behind by a police officer. He pulled away \nfrom the officer and was taken down by several police officers and handcuffed. He \nsubpoenaed the videos and pled not guilty to police assault charges. He showed the videos \nduring his court case, which showed he fell on a police officer after a police officer had \ngrabbed his arm from behind. (Tr. at 53-54; GE 4 at 29; AE Video.) A screenshot of the \nincident is marked as AE M. The video is available for viewing. I considered the dialogue \nbetween the police officers at the end of the video for the limited purpose of assessing \nApplicant\u2019s actions on the safety of others, which was the context of the police officers\u2019 \ndiscussion. The only charge from the incident that resulted in a conviction was impaired \ndriving. (Tr. at 54-55.) His blood alcohol count (BAC) was 0.176. (Tr. at 51; GE 4 at 22.) \nThis incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and cross alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. His court case was \ndecided in October 2020. He was placed on probation for 12 months. He completed a \nsubstance abuse evaluation as part of his probation and after two months he was released \nfrom probation. (Answer at 3; AE H at 4; AE J; AE K; AE L.) \nApplicant was given a substance abuse life circumstance evaluation on September \n8, 2020, and diagnosed as having a severe alcohol use disorder. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 60-61.) \nHe testified his wife had a hard talk with him about where he would be in 20 years, which \nmade him realize he needed to make changes because she was right. (Tr. at 61.) His last \noffense, impaired driving, had cost him a job requiring a clearance for a Federal Department \nso he had to work at a department store \u201cto bring some money to the table.\u201d (Tr. at 62.)

(Tr. at \n61, 63.) He attended 12 to 15 AA meetings over the course of several months. He testified \nhe did not crave alcohol. What he came to realize he did not know how to limit his drinking \nwhen he got in party like situations. (Tr. at 63.) The biggest life change he felt he needed \nto make was \u201csobriety, not drinking at all.\u201d (Tr. at 63.) He stated \u201cit was actually an easy \nthing to cut out of my life it was just the times that I did and when I overdrank is when I, you \nknow, would have incidents and so I've completely cut that out of my life. I\u2019ve been sober \nfor three years.\u201d (Tr. at 64-65.) The last time he drank was in August 2020, the day of the \naccident. (Tr. at 65.) He has changed his lifestyle. He goes to the gym regularly, he plays \nvideo games to keep stress out of his life, and focuses on his wife, his best friend. He avoids \nbars and does not go out on Friday nights the way he had in the past. His family and friends \nand know he does not drink. (Tr. at 66.) He has developed a sober support network \nconsisting of his wife, brother, his parents, and his in-laws. He describes his parents, \nmother-in-law, father-in-law, wife and brother as his biggest supporters by keeping tabs on \nhim and checking in on him. They purposely find different activities that do not involve \nalcohol. (Tr. at 70.) \nSince the 2020 incident Applicant has had no infractions, \u201cnot even a traffic ticket.\u201d \nHe cites that he has paid all his fines from his past actions. He completed a psychosocial \nexam in February 2023 to have a comparison from the exam in 2020. (Tr. 74.) The therapist \nhe saw was very comforting and turned his normal negative look on therapy to wanting to \nattend more. (Tr. at 74.) The evaluation assessed him to have an unspecified adjustment \ndisorder, no addiction treatment needed, and that he did not meet the American Society of \nAddiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria for any level of care. His level of substance impairment \nwas assessed as \u201clow\u201d based on presenting minimal consequences in the major life \ndomains. (AE E at 9-10.) \nApplicant submitted four character letters. (AE A \u2013 AE D.) Three letters were from \nwork colleagues, each with about two years of observation. Each person was aware of why \nthey were submitting letters on his behalf. His colleagues described him as an individual \nwho displayed a high degree of integrity, responsibility, reliability, and good judgment and \nthey found him to be stable, ambitious, and trustworthy. They all work with him in sensitive \nareas and expressed their confidence in him maintaining the integrity of classified systems. \n(AE A; AE C; AE D.) His then fianc\u00e9e, who holds a position of public trust, focused on how \nhe conducts his personal life and how they now live a healthier lifestyle. She noted he is \npassionate about his career and strives to better himself in his field. (AE B.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \u201ccontrol \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access \nto classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from being \neligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15- 01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- 31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22 (d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \nAG \u00b6 23 (d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern \nof \nmodified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant acknowledges his alcohol problem. He has changed his lifestyle to make \nthe behavior unlikely to reoccur. He has established three years of sobriety and abstaining \nfrom alcohol. He successfully completed his assigned classes and programs. He has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence and now presents a low risk. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls \ninto question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s record of arrests and convictions is sufficient to establish the following \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \npotentially disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time, over three years, has elapsed since Applicant last criminal offense. \nHe has changed his lifestyle such that it is unlikely that his alcohol-related misconduct will \nreoccur. He has complied with the terms of his sentences, he has maintained a good \nemployment record, and has created a favorable home environment as part of his \nrehabilitative steps. The mitigating conditions are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine timely \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has worked in a sensitive work \nenvironment for the past two years, earning the respect and confidence of his work \ncolleagues who wrote on his behalf. He has taken the initiative to change his lifestyle. He \nproved that he is reliable and trustworthy and demonstrates good judgment. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J and evaluated all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 1, 2022. On \nFebruary 23, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline H.

(Tr. at 29, 32-33) \nAlthough he used marijuana in State 1, he stated he did not know whether laws in State \n1 permitted the recreational use of marijuana.

(Tr. at 24-25) \nDuring discussions with the company facility security officer (FSO) about his drug use, he \nstated the FSO simply advised him to be honest. The FSO did not tell him that marijuana \nuse was grounds for disqualification. He did not specifically discuss his intent to continue \nusing marijuana with the FSO.  (Tr. 24-29). \nApplicant stated his employer prohibited drug use on the company premises as a \nstrict behavioral matter, and that he did not believe there was an employee drug testing \nprogram. He had never been subject to a drug test. Additionally, he has not participated \nin training for security clearance holders. (Tr. at 34) \nApplicant\u2019s employer was acquired by another company. The transition occurred \nover a 12-month period during the pandemic. During this transition period, there was \nconfusion concerning these policies; the drug use and testing policies of the original \nemployer were unclear. Applicant provided excerpts of the new company\u2019s drug use and \ntesting policies, which he stated are more understandable. The employer\u2019s drug use and \ntesting program policies are consistent with federal requirements. (Tr. 34-37; AE A) \nApplicant testified that after he received the SOR in February 2023, and a copy of \nDOD Directive 5220.6, he understood that his past use of marijuana, and his stated intent \nto use it in the future were disqualifying. He explained that, had he known, his response \nto the question concerning his intent to continue using marijuana in the future would have \nbeen \u201cno\u201d throughout the process. \nI thought the nature of the use; whether or not it was compulsive, risky, or \notherwise exploitable, was the determining factor in evaluating security risk. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGiven the generally pervasive and permissive use of marijuana in society \noverall, I was unaware that any future use would be considered a potential \nsecurity risk.

(Response to SOR at \n3) \nHe went on to state that he has no difficulty complying with the requirement, and that on \nbalance, his professional and personal development is far more important than the rare \ntimes he has used marijuana with family members. (Response to SOR at 3; Tr. at 25) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is described in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable include: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(g):  expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \noccasions: in his April 2022 SCA; his May 2022 investigative interview; and his December \n2022 response to interrogatories. It was not until he received and subsequently \nresponded to the SOR that he denied his intent to continue using marijuana in the future. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(g) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is applicable. This is Applicant\u2019s first time going through the security \nclearance process. He admitted and testified credibly concerning his history of marijuana \nuse starting at the age of 14; and how he was provided marijuana by his high school and \ncollege friends, and his family members during family gatherings at his father\u2019s beach \nhouse. He disclosed his past marijuana use to his former FSO, and requested guidance. \nHe testified that his FSO did not explain the disqualifying nature of illegal drug use for \nanyone seeking access to classified information, past, present and future. He credibly \ntestified he did not understand that using any federally illegal drug, including marijuana, \nwhich has been decriminalized in several states, is threshold disqualifying. In his quest to \nbe honest and consistent with prior statements made throughout the security clearance \nprocess, he expressed his belief that he could continue as per usual, using marijuana a \nfew times a year at his family gatherings. It was only after receiving the SOR that he \nunderstood using any federally illegal drug is disqualifying for security clearance holders. \nWhen he understood this, he made a full stop. He advised his family members he would \nno longer partake in using marijuana at family gatherings; and he declined to use it in \nsubsequent gatherings. Applicant\u2019s testimony on this point was sincere, and credible. He \nlast used marijuana in July 2022, nearly two years ago; and starting in 2010, he had \nalready reduced his use to a few times a year. The behavior happened long ago, and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsince 2010, was so infrequent that it does not cast doubt on his current reliability or \ntrustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully applicable. Appellant acknowledged his drug use, \nsuccessfully refrained from using marijuana for almost two years, and has established a \npattern of abstinence. However, he is unable to successfully disassociate from drug users \nand avoid the environment where drugs were used. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana since \n2010 had been exclusively with his father and a brother, at his father\u2019s beach house during \nbiannual family gatherings. He attends these family gatherings, and his family members \nhave continued their pattern of using marijuana during these occasions. Additionally, he \nhas not completed a statement of intent acknowledging that any future drug involvement \nor misuse would be grounds for revocation of his national security eligibility. Nevertheless, \nhe successfully mitigated drug involvements and substance misuse security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), as described above. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to overcome concerns and doubts about his \njudgment, reliability, and his willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all evidence in the whole-person \ncontext, I conclude Applicant successfully mitigated Guidelines H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse) security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant has not \ntaken any steps to rehabilitate his student loans, despite having the opportunity to do \nso. He has no plan regarding the repayment of the loans. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 18, 2022, the DOD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na determination whether to grant his security clearance.

He admitted the couple had ongoing financial problems. (Tr. 26-\n30) \nWhen the couple separated, Applicant\u2019s recurring personal expenses increased \nbecause he had to pay his own living expenses in addition to his child support \nobligation.

(Tr. 30; GE 2) \nApplicant obtained full employment in October 2013 as a field engineer for a \nprivate company. He earned $27 per hour as well as income from his monthly reserve \nduty. He prioritized paying his $2,300 monthly child support obligation over his other \nfinancial obligations. He admitted that he did not make consistent payments on his \nstudent loans. He made occasional $100 good-faith payments toward the loans \nbetween 2013 and 2019, but admitted that he had never made more than three \nconsecutive payments. He was not sure about the status of his student loans at the end \nof 2019. He claims that he tried to make payment arrangements with the servicer but \nstated that the proposed payment was unaffordable. According to GE 5, a credit \nreported dated November 20, 2023, the loans were delinquent since March 2019. He \ndid not make any payments between March 2019 and December 2019. (Tr. 30-34, 43-\n45; GE 1-2,5) \nIn March 2020, the Department of Education issued student loan relief, which \nplaced all student loans, including those in delinquent or defaulted status, into \nadministrative forbearance. Although the emergency relief ended on September 1, \n2023, the payments on most defaulted student loans will remain in administrative \nforbearance through September 2024 (see, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19). The Department of Education launched the Fresh Start Program to \nallow borrowers to rehabilitate defaulted student loans. Applicant testified that he made \ninquiries about the program but did not enroll. (Tr. 47-48; HE II) \nApplicant testified that after paying his recurring financial expenses, he has only \n$134 in discretionary income each month. He expects his child support obligation to \ndecrease in 2025 because two of his four children will be over 18 years old. Although, \nthe court-ordered obligation will decrease, his education expenses for his children may \nincrease. He has one child entering college in Fall 2024, with another expected to follow \nin Fall 2025. The amount of his financial obligation is unknown, but expects to prioritize \nthe expense over other financial obligations. (Tr. 37-43, 51-52, 56-62; GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant owed \n$110,635 on seven student loans, which were in delinquent status before the Covid-19 \nemergency student loan relief in March 2020. He admitted that he had not made \nconsistent payments on the student loans since at least November 2013, despite having \nall his other debts discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in November \n2013.   \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe following financial considerations disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nNone of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply. The Covid-19 \nemergency student loan relief gave borrowers such as Applicant a once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to rehabilitate their finances by not having to make student loan payments \nbetween March 2020 and September 2023. The relief program also provided borrowers \nlike Applicant the opportunity to rehabilitate their student loans through the Fresh Start \nprogram. Applicant failed to take advantage of these opportunities. He did not present a \nplan to resolve his student loan accounts, and it appears he does not have the means to \ndo so. \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection proceedings. \nRather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a sufficient period \nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable \nsecurity risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Furthermore, applicants are not held to a standard of \nperfection. All that is required is that he develop a plan for handling his delinquent \naccounts and executing a plan to do so. He has not provided a legitimate plan for \nresolving his delinquent debts. Accordingly, he has failed to meet his burdens of \nproduction and persuasion to mitigate the alleged concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He has \nno plans to ever return to using marijuana. \nApplicant used mushrooms from about January 2010 to August 2020. He used \ninfrequently, probably twice, and did not have favorable experiences. He did not get \naddicted to the drug. \nApplicant used cocaine from about January 2011 to January 2018 socially fewer \nthan five times. He did not get addicted to the drug and has no intention of using it in the \nfuture. \nApplicant used heroin and opium from about January 2017 to April 2017.

When he realized what was happening to him, he quit using the drug \n\u201ccold turkey.\u201d It was causing him financial stress, and that was one of the reasons he \nstopped using the drug. \nApplicant used Adderall from about January 2017 to January 2019. He had a \nprescription for about a month during that period (duration not stated) and knew its effects. \nAfter that, he had a friend who had a prescription and who gave him some on perhaps \nfive occasions. \nApplicant described himself as a free spirit when younger and was not afraid to \nexperiment with illegal drugs. He was also curious about the effects of those drugs. He \nhas since realized the danger of that attitude. He has decided that illegal substances will \nnot help him have a brighter future and has made a conscious decision to stop all uses \nof illegal drugs. He has not had any treatment or cessation programs but stopped all uses \non his own. He is adamantly against the use of any illegal drugs at this point in his life \nand has no intentions of using in the future. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. The guidelines are flexible \nrules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the whole-\nperson concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nMarijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms, amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, non-\nprescribed drugs, heroin, and opium are \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d listed on Schedules I \nthrough V of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (c). \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including\u2026purchase. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i alleged Applicant\u2019s years of a pattern of using (for heroin \nand marijuana also purchasing) the federally controlled drugs listed above. He \nunequivocally admitted those allegations. \nFacts admitted by an applicant in an Answer to a SOR require s no further proof \nfrom the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd.

Applicant admitted facts that trigger disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) through (c). \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use has been mitigated, The \nfollowing three mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26: for drug involvement and substance \nabuse may potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges . . . his drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence . . . ; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant\u2019s illegal use of a host of \ndrugs began in 2004 (marijuana). Although that is quite a while ago, it not only continued, \nit ultimately branched out to his illegal use of five other drugs. That train of usage only \nended when for health and wellness reasons he decided to stop on his own in February \n2020. Even so, the record shows that he continued to use marijuana until July 2020. His \n2013 charge and conviction of possession of drug paraphernalia was just another episode \nin what would continue to be a history of drug use. His decades of illegal drug use is not \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 26(a). \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b). During the clearance investigation, \nApplicant was completely forthright in detailing his long history of illegal drug use, thereby \nsatisfying the initial element of this mitigating condition. What is lacking, however, is any \nevidence of his actions to overcome his problem, other than his word that he decided in \n2020 (February or July) to cease illegal drug usage. This mitigating condition also requires \nan applicant to show \u201ca pattern of abstinence.\u201d After nearly 20 years of illegal drug use, \nthree years of abstinence is hardly a sufficient pattern of abstinence. His illegal drug use is \nnot mitigated under AG \u00b6 26(b). \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(c). The record shows only that Applicant \nhad, for a time, a prescription for Adderall. After that expired, he accepted the drug from a \nfriend who had a prescription for that medication. Applicant\u2019s misuse of that medication is \nnot mitigated by AG \u00b6 26(c). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \n5 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 15. More specifically, AG \u00b6 \n16(c) provides the following disqualifying condition: \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified \nor sensitive information. \nIn this case, the SOR made two allegations under Guideline E. The first was that \nin 2010 or 2011 during a drug test administrated by his employer, Applicant fraudulently \nsubmitted someone else\u2019s urine in place of his own. The second was that in about 2018 \nhe was terminated from his employment for testing positive for illegal drugs. He admitted \nthose allegations. His admitted conduct triggers disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(c). \nI have reviewed the entire record and the seven mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(a) through (g). There are no facts that would support any of those mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and \nGuideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \n Against Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \n  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, (Personal Conduct)  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n  \n \n \n                 Subparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered six exhibits into evidence; and Applicant offered nine \nexhibits into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-18; GE 1-GE 6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE I) \nApplicant objected to GEs 5 and 6, which are SCAs dated November 13, 1999, and March \n7, 2010, because they are not recent, redundant with other evidence, of low probative \nvalue, and of low relevance.

(Tr. 51) In 1983, he was in a serious motorcycle \naccident while under the influence of alcohol. (Tr. 51) Over the next 20 years, he drank \nalcohol to intoxication on some weekends. (Tr. 52) Around 2001, he attended Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings, and he stopped drinking alcohol for one year. (Tr. 53) In 2005, \nhe was getting intoxicated on a regular basis, and he attended an alcohol-treatment \nprogram.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides four personal conduct disqualifying conditions that are relevant \nin this case.

Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to two questions on his April 23, 2020 SCA: \u201cIn the last \nseven (7) years have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substance?\u201d and \u201cIn the \nlast seven (7) years, have you intentionally engaged in the misuse of prescription drugs, \nregardless of whether the drugs were prescribed for you or someone else?\u201d He claimed \nthat these omissions and false denials were inadvertent in his SOR response. I disagree. \nHe deliberately failed to disclose the information about his use of cocaine and Percocet \nwithout a prescription in 2016 on his April 23, 2020 SCA because he was worried about \nhis loss of employment, and he wanted to deceive security officials. \nApplicant denied that he used any illegal drugs other than cocaine or misused any \nprescription drugs other than Percocet during the July 2016 to August 2016 timeframe \nduring his March 19, 2021 interview by an authorized investigator for the DOD. I find that \nhe did not use Xanax after 1995, and he was so focused on his use of cocaine and misuse \nof Percocet in July 2016 that he forgot to mention his infrequent use of marijuana in 2016 \nto the investigator. SOR \u00b6 1.h and AG \u00b6 16(b) are refuted because he lacked the intent \nto deceive security officials on these specific issues. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant falsely said, in response to DOHA interrogatories on \nMarch 23, 2023, that he only used cocaine on one or two occasions in 1982 and 10 times \nor less between June and July 2016. Applicant admitted that he used cocaine on more \nthan 10 occasions, and he intentionally minimized the extent of his cocaine use.

He admitted that he was diagnosed in about \nSeptember 2016, with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe; Stimulant Use Disorder, Cocaine \nType, Severe; Opioid Use Disorder, Severe; and Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Mild. However, \nApplicant denied that he was aware of these diagnoses at the time he responded to \nDOHA interrogatories. SOR \u00b6 1.j is not substantiated. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes six conditions which could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance.

After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \nSubstance Misuse Allegations \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply to Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine, use of Percocet \nwithout a prescription, and excessive alcohol consumption. There is no evidence that he \nused cocaine or misused Percocet after August 23, 2016, which was seven years before \nhis hearing. There is no evidence that law enforcement or the courts were involved in \naddressing his misuse of alcohol or possession of illegal drugs. From September to \nNovember 2016, he attended an IOSA program. On November 3, 2016, he successfully \ncompleted the IOSA program. He was honest about his substance abuse at the IOSA \nprogram. He has had some relapses when he consumed alcohol after completion of the \nIOSA program. He frequently attends AA meetings. At his hearing, he credibly stated he \nmost recently consumed alcohol in July 2022, and on that occasion, he drank to \nintoxication. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e are mitigated. \nFalsification Allegations \nOn March 19, 2021, an authorized investigator for the DOD interviewed Applicant, \nand he disclosed that he used cocaine and Percocet without a prescription. The \ninvestigative summary states that Applicant said, \u201che used [cocaine] about ten times over \na two to three week period.\u201d (GE 2 at 8) He said he used \u201ctwo or three Percocet pills per \nday over the same two or three week period.\u201d (Id.) Applicant intentionally minimized the \nfrequency and duration of his cocaine use and use of Percocet without a prescription to \nthe investigator; however, this falsification is not alleged in the SOR. \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed \nfive circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

He made these false statements because he \nwas worried that, if he disclosed the truth, the negative information would adversely affect \nhis security clearance. His lies to security officials are serious and recent. I have lingering \nconcerns that his lapses in judgment are likely to recur and continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline E are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old staff cybersecurity specialist, and he has worked for \ndefense contractors for about 20 years. In 1986, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in \napplied science, and in 1991, he was awarded an MBA degree. He has several \ninformation technology certifications. His resume provides additional details of his \nprofessional experiences.    \nThe general sense of the statements of five coworkers is that they believe \nApplicant is honest, trustworthy, reliable, and professional. His performance reviews for \nApril 2017 to August 2020 indicate he is a highly effective employee who made \ncontributions to his employer\u2019s mission accomplishment. His employer awarded a \ncertificate of recognition to him for five years or service and commitment. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nApplicant\u2019s use of Percocet without a prescription, use of cocaine, and use of \nmarijuana in 2016 are mitigated because they are not recent. He has been sober since \nJuly 2022. He attends AA meetings. The security issues related to this conduct are \nmitigated. \nApplicant intentionally provided false information to security officials on his April \n23, 2020 SCA, during his March 19, 2021 investigative interview, and on his March 23, \n2023 response to DOHA interrogatories. He made these false statements because he \nwas worried that, if he disclosed the truth, the negative information would adversely affect \nhis security clearance and employment. His lies to security officials are serious and \nrecent. They cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

Applicant responded (Answer) to the SOR on February 3, 2023, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 6, 2023. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled on December 8, 2023. Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 12 were admitted in evidence without objection.

He worked for his \ncurrent employer since 2022 under various contracts. He currently works as a network \nengineer for a Federal department and holds a public trust position. He has attended \nsome college and has his IT certification in system administration. He is married and has \ntwo children. (Tr. at 31-37; Answer; GE 1) He is well regarded as evidenced by the \nnumerous character letters. \nApplicant admits all of the Guideline F allegations with explanations. He admits the \nincident that forms the Guideline J allegation and the cross-alleged Guideline G allegation \nbut disputes that he has a problem with alcohol. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 4; GE 12; Answer.) \nFinancial \nApplicant in 2008 decided to enter the real estate market using a $30,000 \ninheritance to purchase properties. He bought six condominiums putting $5,000 down on \neach property under a limited liability company which he \u201cran them pretty much like a \ngame of monopoly.\u201d (Tr. at 37-38.) He attributed his financial distress to renting to his \nfamily who did not pay and would not move out of the properties. (Tr. at 39, 72-73.) He \nfiled for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in May 2010. The total debt discharged was \nvalued at around $1.6 million. He testified all his debts except for student loans were \ndischarged. (Tr. at 30, 39, 41, 42; GE 4.) By 2010, given the difficulties he was having as \na property manager, he had decided to get out of the real estate sector. He included these \nreal estate debts in his Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies but offered no evidence \nthese debts had been satisfied. (Tr. 65-67; GE 9.)  \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in October 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and the \nbankruptcy was dismissed in April 2021 because his spouse had not been included in the \nfiling and it was refiled in April 2021 (SOR 1.a) and dismissed in July 2022. He filed \nanother Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2023, which was dismissed in July 2023. The \nGovernment offered this bankruptcy as whole-person evidence. (Tr. at 16; GE 11.) He \nacknowledged receiving financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process, \u201cone at \nthe beginning and one at the end.\u201d (Tr. at 73-74.)  \nApplicant accrued a number of other debts from his time in the real estate market. \nHe owes the Federal government $6,080 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) in back taxes. He acknowledged \nthere were Federal tax delinquencies, but he was current on his Federal and state tax \nfilings. (Tr. at 70-71.) In his Answer, he states he established a payment arrangement in \nFebruary 2022, but testified there was no formal arrangement. He is letting his tax refunds \ntake care of the tax debts. (GE 1, GE 2; Answer; Tr. at 79.) He owes his state $4,728 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) in back taxes. (GE 1, GE 2; GE 9; Answer.)  \nApplicant admits being sued by various homeowners and condominium \nassociations for nonpayment of dues (SOR \u00b6 1.g) in at least 11 separate civil actions \nsince 2009.

He acknowledges one was for his current home, which he \nbelieves is the 2017 foreclosure. His monthly mortgage payment is $1,800 a month. He \nbelieves he is just over a year behind on his mortgage payments. He is working a short \nsell now.

He offered images \nof his payment statement for his home mortgage that he is trying to bring into good \nstanding.

I honestly can't answer that\u201d as to the remaining three mortgages. \n(Tr. at 61-63, 74; AE P; AE P2.) \nApplicant admitted he had an account charged off in the amount of $221 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f). He testified he placed this debt in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, SOR \u00b6 1.b. This \nbankruptcy was dismissed. (Tr. at 57, 71.) Since 2009, Applicant has been sued eleven \ntimes (SOR \u00b6 1.g) for failing to pay his homeowner and condominium association fees. \nHe did not know why they are associated with him. (Tr. at 64-66; GE 9.) He said he had \na letter stating one lien had been removed but offered no evidence payment or that there \nwas an ongoing dispute. (Tr. at 66.) \nApplicant testified that $5,000 was fraudulently withdrawn from his bank account. \nHe submitted a complaint to his bank, who investigated but did not find for him. The bank \ncould not determine the nature of the withdrawals. He did not file a police report but did \nreport the bank to the Better Business Bureau. He testified the local police would not take \nthe report and he did not file a complaint with any Federal law enforcement agency. (Tr. \nat 46-48, 77-78.) \nWhen Applicant left his position in 2021, he was making $80,000 a year. The next \ncontracts were for less, $69,000 for one year, another for $65,000, and his last contract \nbefore his current contract with the Federal agency was $60,000. He is making $77,000 \nunder his current contract. (Tr. at 74-75.) \nDUI and Alcohol \nApplicant admits he was arrested in September 2021 and charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI) after he lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a tree. (Tr. \nat 81; GE 3.) He testified he suffered a concussion and injured both knees. (Tr. at 82.) He \nwas administratively subject to an interlock device for one year because he had refused \nthe breathalyzer test. He testified he went to trial a year later, and the case was resolved \nby probation before judgment (PBJ). He states the court required him to complete an \nonline class, be subject to an additional year with an interlock device on his vehicle and \nbe on probation until November 14, 2023. He notes he has not had previous driving \nincidents. He testified he no longer drinks and practices sobriety.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant filed multiple bankruptcies. He owes both Federal and state taxes and \nhas other unresolved debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n        \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay   \n   overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(f) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s poor financial situation is current and ongoing. The circumstances in \nhis life have not changed such that it is unlikely to recur. Given these facts there is \nsufficient doubt concerning his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) is not applicable to the SOR allegations. \nThe failure of Applicant\u2019s real estate ventures was not beyond his control. While \nfiling for Chapter 7 bankruptcy was a responsible way to deal with the debts, his \nmismanagement of the properties was the cause of his financial problems. He did suffer \nperiods of underemployment and unemployment and he cited without support that his \nonline bank account had been accessed and funds withdrawn without his consent as \nevidence of circumstances beyond his control. However, an applicant must act \nresponsibly given his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by concomitant conduct even if it may only provide for the payment of debts \none at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). In this matter, \nApplicant has established a history of repeated bankruptcy filings. Aside from the one \npayment history statement, AE P and AE P2, he has failed to resolve judgments and \nforeclosures against him, which does not constitute responsible behavior. ISCR Case No. \n09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). While he may have mitigated one of the four \nforeclosures, his repeated bankruptcy filings, delinquent debts, and unresolved \njudgments and foreclosures concerning his various properties demonstrate that he has \nnot acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable to the SOR \nallegations. \nApplicant\u2019s later bankruptcies in 2020 and 2021 were a continuation of his \nmismanagement of his finances (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), which he had attempted to resolve \nin his initial bankruptcy in 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). His tax debts are unresolved. Despite being \nsued 11 times he has not resolved the issues with either the homeowner associations or \nthe condominium associations (SOR \u00b6 1.g) for failing to pay his homeowner and \ncondominium association fees and he is the subject of multiple foreclosure actions (SOR \n\u00b6 1.h). Applicant has passively waited for any tax refunds to resolve the Federal and state \ntax concerns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). The lone credit-card debt alleged, SOR \u00b6 1.f, was \ncharged off. I am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances \nor that he made a good-faith effort to pay his Federal and state taxes. While he received \nfinancial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process, there is no clear indication that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. A security clearance \nadjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s debts, but rather, a \nproceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHis financial issues since 2010 continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) do not apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s record of arrest and prosecution is sufficient to establish the \nfollowing potentially disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant under AG \u00b6 32: \n(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s one criminal offense. He has \nchanged his lifestyle such that it is unlikely that his alcohol-related misconduct will \nreoccur. He has complied with the terms of his sentence. The mitigating conditions are \nestablished. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 32: \n(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant under AG \u00b6 23: \n(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant acknowledges his alcohol problem. He has changed his lifestyle to make \nthe behavior unlikely to reoccur. He has established three years of sobriety and abstaining \nfrom alcohol. He successfully completed his assigned classes and programs. He has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence and now presents a low risk. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  Paragraph 1, Guideline F: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h:  \n  Paragraph 2, Guideline G: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n    Paragraph 3, Guideline J: \n \n \n \n                \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. Applicant is 31 years old. She has a high school diploma and some college credits. From 2016 until early 2018, she worked as a teacher\u2019s assistant at a local public school. From March 2018 to December 2018, she worked for a trucking company, but she lost her job when the company closed. She was then unemployed until August 2019. She was then briefly employed at another job but was terminated in November 2019 for excessive absences. She was then unemployed again for about eight months until starting her current job at a naval shipyard in September 2020. Applicant earns $18.20 an hour which equates to about $1,075 every two weeks, or $2,150 a month. She explained that a clearance will allow her to travel for work and earn more money. GE 1; Tr. 21-24, 27-28) After losing her job with the trucking company in late 2018, Applicant moved out of her apartment and moved in with her father. She was living with her father when she submitted her SCA, GE 1. She and her wife married in May 2020 and moved in together. She began having medical problems and required surgery, which caused her to miss work for three months, in 2022. She did not have sufficient insurance. She was in such financial distress that her father had to help her with expenses. H",

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non March 11, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \n \n In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o and \n1.v and denied the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p-1.u, all with brief explanations. Her admissions \nare accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is 31 years old. She has a high school diploma and some college credits. \nFrom 2016 until early 2018, she worked as a teacher\u2019s assistant at a local public school. \nFrom March 2018 to December 2018, she worked for a trucking company, but she lost \nher job when the company closed. She was then unemployed until August 2019. She was \nthen briefly employed at another job but was terminated in November 2019 for excessive \nabsences. She was then unemployed again for about eight months until starting her \ncurrent job at a naval shipyard in September 2020. Applicant earns $18.20 an hour which \nequates to about $1,075 every two weeks, or $2,150 a month. She explained that a \nclearance will allow her to travel for work and earn more money. GE 1; Tr. 21-24, 27-28) \nAfter losing her job with the trucking company in late 2018, Applicant moved out of \nher apartment and moved in with her father. She was living with her father when she \nsubmitted her SCA, GE 1. She and her wife married in May 2020 and moved in together. \nShe began having medical problems and required surgery, which caused her to miss \nwork for three months, in 2022. She did not have sufficient insurance. She was in such \nfinancial distress that her father had to help her with expenses. He co-signed for a car so \nshe could get to work. Six months before the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife also left her and \nmoved out, leaving her with bills to pay. (Tr. 21-26, 32, 34, 58-59, 64) \nApplicant disclosed numerous debts on her SCA, including federal student loans, \na car loan, and other consumer credit debts.

(GE 2, GE 3) The debts in the SOR are found on credit reports dated May \n2021, May 2022, and May 2023. (GE 4-GE 6) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($6,645) and 1.b ($3,706) are federal student loans that Applicant took \nout to finance her education. They became delinquent and were assigned for collection \nin 2017. (GE 5, GE 6) Federal student loans were placed in forbearance status by the \nDepartment of Education (DOE) during the COVID pandemic and Applicant\u2019s accounts \nare no longer past due. (GE 4, GE 9) Applicant said she recently received a letter from \nDOE regarding a new \u201cincome contingent\u201d payment schedule, but she has not received \ninformation on next steps. However, she acknowledged that she remains responsible for \nthem. (Tr. 29-31) These debts are unresolved but they are also no longer past due. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,153) is a debt placed for collection for past-due rent. (GE 4, GE 5) \nApplicant said she lived at this apartment before she was married. She lost her job in late \n2018 when her employer, a trucking company, went out of business. The landlord issued \nan eviction notice. She moved in with her father. After this job loss, she was unemployed \nfor eight months, until her current job, which she began in September 2020. She received \na settlement offer of $1,000 for the debt. She plans to address it with her tax refund.

(GE 4, GE 5, GE 6) Applicant testified that her \nmedical debts have been \u201cpiling up.\u201d They are largely due to various chronic medical \nconditions that have required hospitalization, treatment, and surgery. She incurred most \nof these expenses when she did not have insurance or was unemployed. She currently \nhas medical insurance through her job. As to the medical debts in the SOR that she \ndenied, Applicant said that, after some research, she could not verify that the debts were \nhers. She has not yet entered into payment plans for any of the medical debts. (Tr. 26\u00ad\n27, 38, 48-52, 55-57, 61) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($76) is an energy account placed for collection. This debt is unpaid, \nthough Applicant plans on addressing it soon, with help from her father. (GE 4, GE 5, GE \n6, GE 9; Tr. 33-34, 52) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($42) is an account placed for collection. This debt is unpaid, though \nApplicant plans on addressing it soon, with help from her father. (GE 4, GE 5, GE 6; Tr. \n33-34, 52) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o ($10,200) is an account regarding a repossessed vehicle. (GE 4, GE 5) \nThis is the first car that Applicant\u2019s father co-signed for, as noted above. The amount \nalleged is what is owed after the car was sold at auction. She set up a payment plan in \nDecember 2021 at $120 a month starting in February 2022. She made one or two \npayments under this plan. The debt later went to a judgment against Applicant and she \nnow owes about $16,913. (GE 7) Applicant intends to pay this account with her father\u2019s \nhelp, since he co-signed the loan with her.

It remains unpaid. (GE 8; Tr. 57-58) \nIn November 2023, Applicant purchased a $27,000 auto, with a loan co-signed by \nher father. In February 2024, Applicant was in an accident that left her car at a total loss, \nvalued at about $17,600. (AE A) The account is listed as having a balance of about \n$27,000 on a recent credit report, which would mean that she is responsible for the \nremaining balance of about $10,000. (GE 9; Tr. 58-60) \nApplicant now lives by herself. She pays $700 in rent. She was out sick from work \nfor three months in 2022 after surgery. She was paid short-term disability of about $225 \na week. (Tr. 41-45) Applicant has pursued credit counseling informally but did not have \nanything in place at the time of the hearing. After the hearing, she scheduled an \nappointment with a credit counselor that was to occur a few weeks later, in April 2024. \n(Tr. 60, 62-63; AE B) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted several reference letters from friends and \ncolleagues, some of whom have known her for many years. They all attested to her \nresponsibility, integrity, reliability, leadership and problem-solving skills, initiative \nkindness, and ability to work with others. She is also very involved in her community as a \nvolunteer. They recommend her for clearance eligibility without reservation. (AE C) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn \nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained \nin the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred medical expenses due to surgery and medical treatments, much \nof which were not covered by insurance. She also has other debts and delinquencies, \nsuch as past-due rent, a repossession, and federal student loans. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant incurred significant medical debts, due to medical conditions requiring \ntreatment and surgery. In many cases, her expenses were not covered by insurance. She \nhad to miss work, which led her fall behind on other payments. She also experienced job \nlosses and an eviction. Also, her wife moved out about six months before her hearing, \nleaving her with more bills to pay. These circumstances were beyond her control. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) therefore has some application. \nHowever, Applicant also incurred expenses she could not afford. She incurred \nfederal student loans, which became delinquent several years ago. They are no longer \ndelinquent, but they remain unresolved. She turned to her father for help in purchasing a \ncar, but she fell behind on payments and the car was repossessed. With his help, she \nalso purchased a second car, in late 2023. That car was totaled in a February 2024 \naccident. While not alleged in the SOR, Applicant likely remains responsible for the \n$10,000 of that loan that was not covered by insurance. Further, even though her financial \nproblems are partially attributable to circumstances beyond her control, Applicant still has \na requirement to address her debts responsibly through good-faith efforts to engage with \nher creditors and to initiate a track record of reasonable repayment plans. She has not \ndone so, even as to the smallest debts in the SOR. She is pursuing credit counseling but \nit has not taken effect. Further, her debts and overall financial situation are not under \ncontrol. Her debts are ongoing and continue to cast doubt over her current judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. No mitigating conditions fully apply to mitigate financial \nconditions security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under all the facts and circumstances surrounding \nthis case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Applicant is well-regarded at work and in her personal life. Nevertheless, she \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern shown by her \ndelinquent debts. This is not to say she will not be able to establish her eligibility at a \nfuture date. But she needs to establish a reasonable plan for addressing her debts and \ntake some concrete steps putting that plan into place. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.v: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted both allegations in the SOR. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since February 2019. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He is a high school graduate and has some college credits. He is single and has no children. (Tr.13-14; GE 1) Financial Considerations The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal Income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018, (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and failed to file his state income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant admits to not filing his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He believed that he was not required to file them because his income was below the amount required to file income tax returns. He also mistakenly believed he did not have to file if he had refunds. He admits he should have researched the issue before deciding not to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 20-21; Gov 2; Gov 3) During his security clearance background investigation, Applicant answered several interrogatories about his tax filing history.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. On March 1, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On March 21, 2023, Department Counsel was \nready to proceed. The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2023. On November 7, \n2023, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for December 6, 2023. The \nhearing was held as scheduled via video-teleconference. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, GE 1 - 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant offered one exhibit which was admitted as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A, without objection. The record was initially held open until December 20, \n2023, to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. He was granted several \ncontinuances until February 2, 2024. He did not submit documents. On December 18, \n2023, DOHA received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing. The record closed on that date. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted both allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. He has worked for his current employer since February 2019. This is \nhis first time applying for a security clearance. He is a high school graduate and has some \ncollege credits. He is single and has no children. (Tr.13-14; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal Income tax returns for tax \nyears 2017 and 2018, (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and failed to file his state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2017 and 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nApplicant admits to not filing his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 and \n2018. He believed that he was not required to file them because his income was below \nthe amount required to file income tax returns. He also mistakenly believed he did not \nhave to file if he had refunds. He admits he should have researched the issue before \ndeciding not to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. (Answer \nto SOR; Tr. 20-21; Gov 2; Gov 3) \nDuring his security clearance background investigation, Applicant answered \nseveral interrogatories about his tax filing history. (GE 2; GE 3) At the time of completing \nthe interrogatories, he was not sure whether he filed his federal and state income tax \nreturns for 2017 and 2018. He cooperated during the investigation and asked if there \nwere further steps he needed to take to resolve the issue. He provided proof that his \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfederal income tax returns were filed for tax years 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, and 2021. \n(GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 6-10) \nIn February 2023, Applicant received the SOR. He became aware that he was \nrequired to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He immediately \nhired an accountant to help him file his income tax returns. He completed and filed his \n2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns on March 20, 2023. He received refunds for \neach tax year. He provided proof that both his 2017 and 2018 federal and state income \ntax returns were sent via Fed Ex to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the state \ndepartment of taxation. (AE A) He testified that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \naccepted his returns but advised him that he would not receive the refunds because he \nwaited more than three years to file his tax returns. After 2018, he has filed his federal \nand state income tax returns on a timely basis. He does not owe any tax debts to the IRS \nor the state department of taxation. (Tr. 22-27) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following applies in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 19(f) applies because Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2017 and 2018. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies because although Applicant failed to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for 2017 and 2018, he held the mistaken belief that he did not have to \nfile his income tax returns for those years. Once he learned that this was incorrect, he \nhired an accountant and filed the tax returns within a month. Applicant also timely filed \nhis federal and state income tax returns from 2019 to present. The conduct occurred \nunder circumstances that make it unlikely to recur. It does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies. Upon learning that he needed to file his 2017 and 2018 state \nand federal income tax returns, Applicant took steps to file them in a timely manner. He \nreceived refunds for each tax year. His failure to file was based on a mistaken belief that \nhe was not required to file his income tax returns for those tax years. He will not make \nthat mistake in the future as evidenced by his timely filing of income tax returns for \nsubsequent tax years. \nApplicant met his burden of proof to mitigate the concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable employment with his current employer since \nFebruary 2019. I considered that Applicant was in his 20s during 2017 and 2018, when \nhe mistakenly believed that he was not required to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns. He is now older and more mature. Upon learning of his mistake, he hired an \naccountant to prepare his 2017 and 2018 federal and state income tax returns. The \nreturns were filed within a month. After 2018, he has timely filed his federal and state \nincome tax returns. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2017 and 2018 was an anomaly due to his mistaken belief he was not required \nto file returns. \nThe security concerns raised under Financial Considerations are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:\n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nErin C. Hogan \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",
