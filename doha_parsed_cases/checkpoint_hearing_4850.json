On September 26, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline\nD (Sexual Behavior) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n\n2\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge John Grattan Metz, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a\ntimely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent and sustainable findings of fact:  Applicant is an\ninformation manager employed by a defense contractor.

Though placing\nhim in a low risk category for recidivism, she recommended he attend group sex offenders treatment,\nsubstance abuse treatment (alcohol) and family counseling.  He complied with these\nrecommendations.\nApplicant called two psychologists to testify at the hearing.  They gave similar testimony, to\nthe effect that Applicant\u2019s offense was situational, in that it was affected by financial and work\nrelated stress, alcohol abuse, and lack of communication with his wife.  Due to improved\ncircumstances, both gave Applicant a favorable prognosis and stated that he was a low risk for\nreoffense.  One expert testified, however, that between five and ten years after the offense the chance\nof reoffense rose from 7.6 % to 11.2 %.  Applicant\u2019s wife and the victim testified favorably on his\nbehalf, though both apparently were cognizant that the family has paid an economic price for his\ncrime, since Applicant is the sole financial support.  Applicant testified that he did not advise the\nMarine Corps of the case, nor did he advise his civilian employer until his guilty plea in November\n2001.  The Judge noted that Applicant was not totally consistent in his various statements as to the\nnumber of times he abused his daughter.  \nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\nSee Dorfmont v.

Applicant answered the SOR 7 October 2005 and\n1\nrequested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 9 December 2005 and I convened a hearing 16\nFebruary 2006. DOHA received the transcript 27 February 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as\nfindings of fact. He is a 46-year-old information manager, employed by a defense contractor since\nMarch 2001, seeking his industrial clearance. He previously held a clearance while serving in the\nU.S. Marine Corps from 1978 to 2001.\nOn 2 July 2001, the day after his retirement from the Marine Corps,  Applicant surrendered\n2\nto police on a felony arrest warrant for indecent liberties with a minor by custodian. The precipitating\nevent for this arrest was the discovery that Applicant had sexually abused his adopted daughter from\nabout October 1997, when she was 13 years old, to 2001, when she was 16. On 21 May 2001, the\nvictim revealed the abuse to her grandmother, who reported it to her mother, who in turn reported\nit to Child Protective Services (CPS). CPS contacted the victim at school on 21 May 2001, and\ncontacted Applicant on 22 May 2001, when it was arranged to have Applicant leave the family home\nso the victim and Applicant\u2019s two natural children could remain in the home with their mother rather\nthan be placed in protective custody. He was not allowed to have any contact with any of the children\nfor the next six months.\nApplicant was subsequently indicted on these charges, and on 19 November 2001, pled\nguilty. On 15 February 2002, he was sentenced: five years incarceration, with all but six months\nsuspended, and payment of all costs associated with the case. He was permitted to serve the six\nmonths incarceration on work release, returning each day to jail. He was required to participate in\nalcohol counseling, mental health counseling, sex offender counseling\u2014including registering on the\nstate police sex offender registry.  He was also placed on three-years supervised probation, beginning\n3\nafter his release from incarceration.\nApplicant fully complied with the terms of his sentence. In November 1991, he was\ndiagnosed as a pedophile by a court-appointed specialist\u2014a license clinical psychologist, certified\nsex offender treatment provider, and certified addictions specialist\u2014as part of his pre-sentence\ninvestigation. Although she placed him in the low-risk category for recidivism for sexual offenses,\n\n3\nshe nevertheless recommend that he attend group sex offenders treatment, outpatient substance abuse\n(alcohol) treatment, and other family counseling as needed. He was recommended to have only\nsupervised visitation with his two natural children. Applicant satisfactorily complied with the\nprogram recommendations.\nDuring Applicant\u2019s participation in the treatment programs, he was eventually allowed to\nvisit with his younger children, first in CPS offices with his wife and CPS personnel present. The\nfrequency and length of visits expanded over time and by the middle of 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife was\npermitted to be the sole supervisor of these visits (Tr. 274). Applicant was released from\nincarceration in July 2002, and from supervised probation in July 2005. In the summer of 2005,\nApplicant was allowed overnight visits to the family home, first one night per week, then two, then\nthree. He was allowed to return to the family home permanently in November 2005. In January 2006,\nhe was released from the jurisdiction of CPS (Tr. 293). He was released from counseling in February\n2006 (Tr. 62, 117).\nAt hearing, Applicant submitted counseling records and testimony from two psychologists.\nThe first was his counselor through the most important period of his post-trial counseling\u2014who had\njust released him from further counseling requirements. The other was the specialist who evaluated\nhim for the pre-sentence report, and had been asked by Applicant to provide an updated evaluation\nfor his clearance hearing. Both emphasized common themes in their favorable testimony for\nApplicant: that Applicant was a situational offender rather than a preferential offender, meaning that\nhis sexual attraction was to his adopted child, not to his natural children or children in general (Tr.\n92, 107), i.e. that preferential offenders are at greater risk to re-offend. Both noted the family issues\nthat contributed to his misconduct: financial and work stresses, alcohol abuse, lack of\ncommunication with his wife. Both noted his significant lifestyle changes and his improved\ncommunication with his wife. Both gave him a favorable prognosis, and stated that he was at low\nrisk to re-offend. However, both psychologists acknowledge certain reservations and caveats to their\nopinions. His regular counselor acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s giving gifts to the victim to ensure\ncompliance and silence (known as \u201cgrooming\u201d) showed Applicant\u2019s intentionality in his\nmisconduct\u2014notwithstanding the stressors present in his life (Tr. 111). Although she considered the\nrisk of re-offense low (5% over 5 years)(Tr. 82), she was not comfortable describing Applicant as\n\u201crehabilitated (Tr. 103).\u201d Further, she had devised a \u201csafety plan\u201d for Applicant and his wife to use\nwith their two minor children, prescribing certain behaviors for Applicant to abide by (Tr. 116). Still,\nshe stated she would not have discharged him from counseling if she thought he was still relying\nlargely on external restraints (Tr. 117).\nThe other expert\u2019s testimony was substantially similar, except for noting that sexual abuse\nwas not a diagnosis that could be considered \u201cin remission (Tr. 200).\u201d Although she concurred that\nApplicant\u2019s risk of re-offending was low, she considered the risk not only higher over five years\n(7.6%), but noted that the risk actually rose between five and ten years (11.2%)(Tr. 181, 220). In\naddition, she conceded that her February 2006 evaluation did not include review of treatment records\nfrom earlier periods of treatment that were less favorable to Applicant (Tr. 209, 224-225)\nBoth the victim (now age 20) and Applicant\u2019s wife testified favorably on his behalf,\nincluding details about  how their relationships with Applicant are much better than they were before\nthe sexual abuse was disclosed. However, in both instances there are details that are in sharp variance\nwith that testimony. Although the victim testified that she would trust being alone with him, the\n\nIn similar fashion, she sent a letter to the judge before his sentencing, pleading with him to keep Applicant\n4\nout of jail because of the financial impact it would have on the family. She characterized the criminal proceedings\nand CPS involvement in the case as detrimental to her financial future (G.E. 10).\n4\nsafety plan requires that he not be alone with her at home (Tr. 40). More tellingly, while she stated\nthat she testified at the hearing as a means of getting some closure, she clearly views the criminal\nproceedings and possibly the clearance hearing as punishing the family as much as the Applicant,\nlargely because of the potential financial impact on the family and her ability to continue in college\n(Tr. 42-44).  Applicant\u2019s wife similarly varies between stating that she is very vigilant of his\n4\nbehavior, yet feeling that the family paid most for his crime because he is essentially the sole\nfinancial support for the family (Tr. 166-168).\nIn his testimony, Applicant testified that he did not advise the Marine Corps of the charges\nagainst him. He did not advise his civilian employer of the charges until his guilty plea in November\n1991. The employer did not advise the government of the adverse information until his sentencing\nin February 2002. His security officer is aware of his conviction, as are some of his key bosses.\nHowever, personnel at his work site are unaware of his conviction. He is on the state police registry\nof violent sexual offenders. Applicant has given inconsistent descriptions of the extent of his sexual\nabuse of his daughter. During the initial CPS investigation, he simply deferred to whatever his\ndaughter said, although the record contains no first hand report from her, merely the recorded notes\nof CPS personnel. Applicant\u2019s 30 July 2003 sworn statement (G.E. 2) records a wide variety of\nsexual misconduct, but lacks details on the number of occasions. At hearing, he variously described\nthe abuse as 5-7 times (Tr. 308), \u201cbest guess\u201d (Tr. 311), not recalling the number of times (Tr. 327).\nNevertheless, he did not retreat from the numbers implied in his sworn statement (Tr. 327).\nApplicant\u2019s work and character references give him favorable recommendations for obtaining\nhis clearance.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\nE2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\n6\nformally charged; E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nE2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal behavior was not recent; E2.A10.1.3.2. The crime was an isolated incident; \n7\nE2.A10.1.3.3. The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no\n8\nlonger present in that person\u2019s life;\nE2.A10.1.3.4. The person did not commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to\n9\nrecur;\nE2.A10.1.3.6. There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.\n10\nE2.A4.1.2.1.

Compulsive or addictive sexual behavior when the person is unable to stop a pattern of self-\n12\ndestructive or high-risk behavior or that which is symptomatic of a personality disorder;\n5\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.5\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J by demonstrating\nthat Applicant sexually abused his adoptive daughter between October 1997 and May 2001.  He\n6\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct. His criminal conduct was both\nrecent, in the context of being under probation until July 2005, and not isolated, having constituted\na course of conduct over more than three years.  Similarly, he was not pressured or coerced into\n7\ncommitting the criminal acts,  and his conduct was entirely voluntary.  While he presented\n8\n9\nsubstantial evidence of successful rehabilitation, I do not consider that he has provided clear\nevidence of rehabilitation, given the caveats expressed by his psychological experts.  I resolve\n10\nGuideline J against Applicant.\n \nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline D by\ndemonstrating that Applicant sexually abused his adopted daughter for over three years.  He was\n11\ndiagnosed as a pedophile, albeit situational as opposed to preferential.   Although Applicant claims\n12\nthat he is not in a position to be exploited, it does not appear that knowledge of his past conduct is\n\nE2.A4.1.2.3. Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\n13\nduress;\nE2.A4.1.2.4. Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\n14\nE2.A4.1.3.1. The behavior occurred during or prior to adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent\n15\nconduct of a similar nature;\nE2.A4.1.3.2. The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar\n16\nnature;\nE2.A4.1.3.3. There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional\n17\ninstability;\nE2.A4.1.3.4. The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\n18\n6\nmuch known outside government personnel involved in his clearance adjudications.  His conduct\n13\nbetrays a significant lack of discretion and judgment.14\nThe conclusions of his experts notwithstanding, Applicant failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by his sexual behavior. The conduct occurred when Applicant was not an\nadolescent.  The conduct is still recent.  Further, his sexual behavior is not the only evidence of\n15\n16\nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability.   His delay in reporting his criminal\n17\ncharges to his employer, and in the case of the Marine Corps failing to report it altogether, suggest\nan unwillingness to come forward with adverse information raising security concerns until such\ninformation is likely to become public through other sources. Finally, even accepting that Applicant\nhas ceased his sexual abuse and is unlikely to re-offend, his past conduct still serves as a basis for\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.  Paradoxically, he may be subject to potential duress whether he\n18\nre-offends or not, because even a false claim that he abused either of his natural children, now 12\nand 11 (just younger that the victim when Applicant began abusing her), could bring tremendous\npressure on Applicant. Further, Applicant was only recently released from probation, the custody of\nCPS, and his required treatment. While his psychologist testified that she would not have released\nhim from treatment if she thought he was still relying on external forces to avoid re-offending, the\nfact remains that February 2006, is the first time he has been completely without external forces,\nincluding the possibility that his probation be revoked. He has no established track record back in\nthe home without these external forces, and even within the home is being watched very carefully\nby his wife. Applicant views his re-introduction into the family home, and release from probation,\nCPS jurisdiction, and treatment requirements, as the successful conclusion of his journey, whereas\nI see it as only the beginning of a potentially successful journey. On balance, I find it too early to tell\nif Applicant will avoid recurrence of his sexual misconduct. I resolve Guideline D against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 27, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Christopher Graham granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel\nsubmitted a timely appeal, and Applicant cross-appealed, pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge resolved\nconcerns under Guideline B about Applicant\u2019s ties of affection to his relatives in Israel by a \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d analysis that was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.   Department Counsel argued that\n1\nthe Judge\u2019s whole person analysis was conclusory in nature and not based upon substantial record\nevidence.  \nIn his whole person analysis, the Judge relied on numerous unchallenged findings of fact\nwhich cumulatively support his ultimate conclusion that Applicant has sufficiently strong ties to the\nU.S. to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  These facts include the following: Applicant\nis a U.S. citizen with \u201calmost thirty-five years of successful employment in this country;\u201d Applicant\nwas educated in the U.S.;  his children are U.S. citizens; and  Applicant has no financial ties to Israel.\nThe Judge also found that Israel\u2019s status as a U.S. ally  renders it less likely that Israel would exploit\nApplicant\u2019s relatives.  In addition, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s demeanor buttressed the\ncredibility of his testimony that he has attachments in the U.S. and will protect U.S. secrets.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 (\u201c[T]he Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of\nthe Administrative Judge.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006).  Given the record\nbefore him, the Judge has articulated a rational explanation for his favorable decision.  An issue on\nappeal concerns Applicant\u2019s brother, a retired Israeli military officer.  In a similar situation, the Board\nnoted there was no basis to conclude that an applicant\u2019s brother (who was a retired officer in the Air\nForce of Taiwan) is currently an agent of the government.  See ISCR 03-17071 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.\n22, 2006).  An appealing party\u2019s disagreement with a Judge\u2019s decision is not a sufficient basis to\nestablish that he erred.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-05912 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2001).  The Board\n2\nconcludes that the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law, given the totality of facts and circumstances in this case.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nBecause of this holding, issues raised by Applicant on cross-appeal are moot.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

He is divorced.  He has two children that are U.S. citizens, one by birth, the other by\nnaturalization.  He is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel.

The SOR alleged reasons\nunder Guidelines C (foreign preference) and B (foreign influence) and detailed why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nIn a written statement dated October 14, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the\nSOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on April 22, 2005.  A Notice of Hearing\nwas issued June 9, 2005, scheduling the hearing for June 29, 2005.  On June 24, 2005, Applicant\nretained new counsel who requested a continuance.  I granted the motion.  On September 15, 2005,\na Notice of Hearing was issued setting the hearing for October 24, 2005.  On October 21, 2005, both\nparties requested a continuance.  That same day I granted the motion and set the hearing for\nNovember 14, 2005.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  At the hearing, the government offered\neight exhibits and asked for administrative notice of eight additional exhibits.  I sustained objections\nto administrative exhibits 3 and 7.  Applicant submitted forty-two exhibits.  I sustained objections\nto Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G-N, W-Z, AA, CC, and DD1-DD4.   He requested I take administrative\n1\nnotice of Appeal Board case No. 02-26978, September 21, 2005, which was granted.   Applicant\n2\ncalled two witnesses and he testified in his own behalf.  Applicant\u2019s third witness was unavoidably\ndetained and I recessed the hearing until November 28, 2005.   On that date Applicant called one\n3\nwitness and the record was closed.  The transcript (Tr.) was received December 1, 2005, and\nDecember 8, 2005.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted  the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 2.d. and 2.e.

He\n7\nbecame a naturalized U. S. citizen in 1982.   He had been married to an Israeli citizen and was\n8\ndivorced in 1986.  He has not remarried.   He raised two daughters, one born in Israel and now a\n9\nnaturalized U.S. citizen and the other born in the U.S.   He has little contact with his former wife.\n10\n11\n   \nApplicant has two brothers and a sister who are citizens and residents of Israel.   One brother\n12\nwas a general officer in the Israel Air Force, then headed the Israeli equivalent of the U.S. Federal\nAviation Administration, and is now retired.   He talks by phone with his brother 3-4 times per year\n13\nand emails him about the same frequency.   He last saw his family in Israel in 1998 when he\n14\ntraveled there for their mother\u2019s funeral.   His brother came to the U.S. to visit him in 2000, when\n15\nhe had heart surgery.16\nAnother of Applicant\u2019s brothers is a bus driver and tour guide, with no connection to the\nIsraeli government.   He talks with this brother by phone 3-4 times per year.   His brother never\n17\n18\ninquires about Applicant\u2019s work nor has he ever asked him for any classified information.   This\n19\nbrother and his wife came to the U.S. to visit in 1999.20\nHis sister is a retired teacher, and he has telephone contact with her the same as with his\nbrothers, 3-4 times per year.  He only discusses family matters with her, and she has never asked him\nabout his work.   \n21\n\nId. at 133-135.\n22\nId. at 136.\n23\nId. at 137.\n24\nId. \n25\nId. at 138.\n26\nId. at 138-140.\n27\nId. at 141.\n28\nId. at 159.\n29\nId. at 160-164.\n30\nId. at 143-144.\n31\n4\nAllegation 2.d. of the SOR alleges he has a friend who is a citizen and resident of Israel.\nDuring one of his trips to Israel, he met a lady who worked at an Israeli university.  They dated\nsocially and were considering marriage.  She wished to remain in Israel, however,  because both of\nher parents were living.  Applicant did not want to move to Israel and the relationship ended more\nthan two years ago.  She never inquired about his employment.  He no longer has contact with her.22\nApplicant traveled to Israel three times in 1995, once in 1996 or 1997, and in 1998 for his\nmother\u2019s funeral.   His father died in 1985, but Applicant did not attend the funeral because of his\n23\npending divorce.   Since 1998, there also have been two family weddings and the funerals for a\n24\nsister-in-law and a brother-in-law which he did not attend.   Each time he has traveled to Israel he\n25\nused his Israeli passport because the government of Israel requires persons with dual citizenship to\npossess and use an Israeli passport.   On one trip he forgot his Israeli passport and was allowed into\n26\nthe country using his U.S. passport, but he was warned that it would not be allowed in the future.27\nHe has never been asked by anyone in Israel what his work entailed or for other such information.28\nAround 1979, Applicant worked for a different contractor who had a job with an Israeli\ngovernment contractor.  He was assigned to assist because he spoke Hebrew and could communicate\nwith the Israeli employees.   A contract dispute arose between his company and the Israeli\n29\ngovernment that had nothing to do with Applicant\u2019s work.  He defended his company in negotiations\nbetween Israel and his employer.   \n30\nApplicant applied for and was issued an Israeli passport in November 2001, and it expired\nin November 2002.  It has not been renewed.  He obtained this passport because of illness in his\nIsraeli family and he thought about visiting them.   \n31\n\nMemorandum, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence,\n32\nsubject \u201cGuidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference\nAdjudicative Guideline,\u201d August 16, 2000.

Applicant was unaware of this policy until October 2004, when\nhe received a copy of the Memorandum with the SOR.   He is willing to surrender his expired Israeli\n33\npassport, but he cannot find it or his U.S. passport.   In the past he signed statements indicating he\n34\nmight renew his passport.   With his understanding of the Money Memorandum, he is willing to\n35\nsurrender his Israeli passport and does not intend to renew it.   He would side with the U.S. if\n36\ndiplomatic ties between Israel and the U.S. were to be broken,  but would not bear arms against\n37\nIsrael.   At age 66 and with a history of heart surgery, it is most unlikely he would be asked to bear\n38\narms against any country.   If a family member were to be held hostage or a foreign government\n39\nasked him for classified information, he would contact the appropriate U.S. security authorities.40\nIf Applicant were to travel to Israel in the future, he would request permission from the Israeli\nEmbassy to travel as an American on a U.S. passport.41\nApplicant commenced proceedings to obtain a security clearance in 1984, but abandoned the\nrequest when he changed employment.42\nIn describing Applicant, the president of his company used terms such as \u201cgood-hearted,\nquiet, does his work, true gentleman, contributes to company social events, professional, honest, and\nquality work.\u201d   His immediate supervisor used terms such as \u201ccommitted, dedicated, reliable,\n43\nstrong work ethic, thorough, accurate, and no question of his honesty and integrity\u201d in describing\nApplicant.

Dec. 19, 2002).\n59\nId., at 3.\n60\nSee Egan; Directive \u00b6  E2.2.2.\n61\n7\ninformation.\u201d   The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United\n55\nStates citizens \u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United\nStates, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as\nwell as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to\nabide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d   Eligibility\n56\nfor a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating\nthe security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the\napplicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that\nthe circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.   The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\n57\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.58\nOnce the Government establishes its case, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n59\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   A person\n60\nwho has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government\nbased on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each\napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect\nthe national interests as his or his own.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\nGovernment.   Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible\n61\nrisk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, not actual,\nrisk of compromise of classified information.\n\nMoney Memorandum, supra, at 1. \n62\nId. \n63\n8\nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than\nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. \nHaving considered the evidence as a whole,  I find the following guidelines most pertinent\nto an evaluation of the facts of this case: \nGuideline C (foreign preference) \nE2.A3.1.1.The Concern: (When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States).\nGuideline B (foreign influence) \nE2.A2.1.1. The Concern: (A security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family, including\ncohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or\nobligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations\ncould create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are\nalso relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or pressure).\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Preference\nThe Government has established its case under Guideline C by showing that Applicant\nexercised dual citizenship with Israel, possessed and used an Israeli passport, and served in the Israeli\nArmy.  Therefore, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. (The exercise\nof dual citizenship), E2.A3.1.2.2. (Possession and/or use of a foreign passport), and  E2.A3.1.2.3.\n(Military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country) are applicable.\n  \nThe Money Memorandum  of August 16, 2000, clarifies DoD policy regarding the\n62\npossession and/or use of foreign passports. It requires that \u201cany clearance be denied or revoked\nunless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the\nappropriate agency of the United States Government.\u201d   Under the Money Memorandum, possession\n63\nand/or use of a foreign passport is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety,\nrequirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  Applicant\u2019s Israeli passport\n\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n64\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\n65\n9\nexpired in 2002, and he does not intend to renew it. Further, he lost this passport which is the\nfunctional equivalent of destroying it.  Therefore, the Money Memorandum does not apply.\nApplicant is a citizen of Israel because he was born there.  Foreign Preference Mitigating\nCondition  E2.A3.1.3.1. (Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry) is applicable. .  \n In as much as Applicant\u2019s mandatory service in the Israeli Army ended eight years before\nhe immigrated to the U. S., Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.2.(Indicators of\npossible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States\ncitizenship) applies.\nApplicant expressed his willingness to renounce his Israeli citizenship  in his testimony and\nin his amended response to the SOR.  Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.4.\n(Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship) is applicable. \n \nApplicant\u2019s passport expired in November 2002.  He has no intention of renewing it.\nAccordingly, I find Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline C.\nForeign Influence\nA security risk may exist when an applicant\u2019s immediate family, or other persons to whom\nhe may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U. S., or may be\nsubject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result\nin the compromise of classified information. \nThe government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant\u2019s two brothers and\na sister are citizens and residents of Israel.  Therefore, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions\n(FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close\nties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country) and FI DC\nE2.A2.1.2.3. (Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government)\nboth apply.  \nUnder the Directive, potentially disqualifying conditions may be mitigated through the\napplication of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept and specific mitigating conditions.  When the Government\nproduces evidence raising potentially disqualifying conditions, an Applicant has the burden to\nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the conditions.   The government never\n64\nhas the burden of disproving a mitigating condition.65\nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. provides (A determination that\nthe immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters),\ncohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be\n\nISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004). \n66\nDirective, \u00b6 E2. A2. 1.3.1.\n67\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.3.\n68\n10\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States).  Applicants must establish: (1) that the individuals in\nquestion are not \u201cagents of a foreign power,\u201d and (2) that they are not in a position to be exploited\nby a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved\nand the United States.66\nApplicant\u2019s brothers and sister do not meet the definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d under\n50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(6) and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b).  Similarly, they would not be considered as an \u201cagent\nof a foreign power\u201d under the more expansive definition adopted by the Appeal Board.  The\navailable evidence indicates his brothers and sister have no ties to or economic dependence upon the\nIsraeli government.  His relationship with a person living in Israel ended over two years\u2019 ago and he\nhas no contact with her. \nThe second prong of the test is whether the relatives in question are \u201cin a position to be\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d   The federal statute, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a), defines\n67\n\u201cforeign power\u201d to include: a foreign government; a faction of a foreign nation; an entity openly\nacknowledged by a foreign government to be controlled by that foreign government; a group engaged\nin international terrorism; a foreign-based political organization; or an entity directed and controlled\nby a foreign government. \nTo determine whether Applicant was \u201cin a position to be exploited by a foreign power,\u201d I\nmust examine Applicant\u2019s connection to his family in the foreign country.  His family residing in\nIsrael present somewhat of a  vulnerability; although they have no connection to or dependence upon\na foreign power, they are still under the physical control of the Israeli government.  Applicant\u2019s\nrecord of successful employment, the fact that Israel and the U.S. enjoy a good relationship, that the\nIsraeli government respects human rights, and Israel\u2019s dependence on the U.S. for military and\neconomic aid make it unlikely that he would be vulnerable to improper influence through his\nrelatives in Israel.\nHowever, as discussed above, in order to apply the second prong of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1., the\nAppeal Board requires that applicants affirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone\nwould attempt to exploit a foreign relative in the future.  Also, the Appeal Board prohibits any\nconsideration of evidence that is not dispositive of the issue.  Finally, the Appeal Board finds it\nirrelevant to this issue whether an applicant is likely to be improperly influenced by a foreign relative\nor associate.  Applying that standard, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. does not apply.\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept \u2013 not the potentially disqualifying or mitigating conditions \u2013 is\nthe heart of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance.   Indeed, the\n68\n\nISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-09389 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29,\n69\n2004).\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (footnotes omitted); accord ISCR Case No. 03-23259\n70\nat 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2006).\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n71\nMuch of this discussion may be found in ISCR Case No. 03-21423 at 7-15 (May 24, 2006).\n72\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n73\n11\nAppeal Board has repeatedly held that an administrative judge may find in favor of an applicant\nwhere no specific mitigating conditions apply.69\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or her relatives or associates\nin a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  \u201cAlthough the position of an\napplicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and may preclude the favorable application of FI\nMC E2.A2.1.3.1., the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances (including the realistic\npotential for exploitation) may still warrant a favorable application of the relevant general factors.\u201d70\nOne of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors which must be considered is \u201cthe potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d   First must be considered the character of the foreign power in\n71\nquestion, including the government and entities controlled by the government within the country.\nA friendly relationship is not determinative, but it may make it less likely that  Israel would attempt\nto exploit a U.S. citizen through his relatives or associates.72\nIt is also helpful to consider Applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 vulnerability to exploitation by foreign\npowers in Israel.  While Applicant\u2019s three siblings live in Israel they may not be more vulnerable to\nthe Israeli government.  While it may be argued that his brother who is a retired general officer in\nthe Israeli Air Force could be a direct conduit of information from Applicant to the government of\nIsrael, it is just as conceivable that because of his brother\u2019s standing with the government, his family\nis less likely to suffer harm.\nMost importantly, it is necessary to consider Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation through\nhis relatives.  Applicant is a mature individual with almost thirty-five years of successful\nemployment in this country. He is a U.S. citizen as are his children.  He was educated in this country.\nApplicant has strong ties to the United States.  Because of Applicant\u2019s deep and long-standing\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the United States.  Further because of Israel\u2019s financial and military dependance on the U.S., I find\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress does not constitute a security risk.73\nApplicant has no assets in Israel.  FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (Foreign financial interests are\nminimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities) applies.\n\n12\nIf a suggestion is made that Applicant might divulge classified information to his brother, it\nis not a plausible argument.  Applicant has waited 38 years since immigrating to this country, at the\nage of 66, and after heart surgery, to apply for a clearance.\nI carefully evaluated the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved\nin favor of the national security.  I considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor while testifying and considered\nhis credibility.  He has a reputation for honesty, integrity, and good work ethic.  I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the potential security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its submission\ndoes not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005).\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 1.\n2\nId at 3.\n3\nId at 1.\n4\nId.\n5\n2\nthe hearing, Administrative Judge Christopher Graham denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.   Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge erred in concluding Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application\nwas deliberate; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.\nApplicant contends he was denied due process.  In that regard, he argues that Department\nCounsel led him to believe that representation by counsel had little effect in cases such as his and\ncould actually prove to be detrimental.   He also argues that at the hearing Department Counsel\n2\nraised his voice and acted unprofessionally, and attempted to sway the Judge with emotional\narguments.    Finally, Applicant argues that because of his extreme anxiety at the hearing, he did not\n3\nnotice that Department Counsel had not presented all the evidence relevant to Applicant\u2019s case.4\nApplicant does not specifically identify this evidence but attaches copies of what are presumably the\nmissing items of evidence with his brief.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry out their duties\nin good faith. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 20, 2001).  A party seeking to\nrebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Applicant has not met that\nheavy burden.  In his brief, Applicant states that his decision to proceed pro se was also due to \u201cthe\nfinancial impossibility of my retaining a lawyer.\u201d   The documents which Applicant attaches with\n5\nhis brief were in fact made part of the record of the case.  Applicant fails to identify anything in the\nrecord below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to conclude that Department\nCounsel had acted improperly, unfairly or unprofessionally.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 05-04923 at\n3, n. 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2007); ISCR Case No. 03-21329 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 25, 2006).\nDOHA proceedings are civil in nature and applicants are not entitled to the procedural\nprotections afforded to criminal defendants.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 5-6 (App. Bd.\nOct. 7, 2004).  Therefore, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are of no moment.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. July 24, 2006).  A review of the record indicates that\nApplicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the\nDirective, as well as prehearing guidance (which advised that Applicant could appear by himself,\nwith an attorney he selected and paid for, or with a personal representative).  Although pro se\napplicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps\nto protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14,\n\n3\n2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that failure to act does not\nconstitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).\nBecause Applicant did not raise his concerns with the Judge during the hearing, or otherwise object\nto proceeding, he was not denied due process under the Directive or Executive Order.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 03-04927 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005)(No denial of due process where pro se\nApplicant claimed \u201c. . . she was no match for the \u2018very serious and prepared professionals\u2019 who\nrepresented the government\u201d).\n(2) Applicant also contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose he had previously been terminated from a job because he had\nmisrepresented his education on an application/resume.  In support of this contention, he argues that\nthe omission of the information was due to a misunderstanding on his part, he has openly\nacknowledged his mistake in that regard, and he subsequently provided the correct information.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was\ndeliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\nThe security concern raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification was not necessarily overcome by Applicant\u2019s\nsubsequent disclosures to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22,\n2004).  \n(3) Finally, Applicant argues that the security concerns raised by his disqualifying conduct\nunder Guideline E are outweighed by the favorable evidence he presented, including his 23 years of\nfaithful and diligent service.  Again, Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate error on the part\nof the Judge.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant\nunder Guidelines B and J.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the\n\n4\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s other security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On September 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 5, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on November 13, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on November\n16, 2007, scheduling the hearing for December 4, 2007.  At the hearing the Government\n\n2\npresented five exhibits.  The Applicant presented no exhibits, nor called any witnesses.\nHe did testify on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on December\n14, 2007.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 62 years old and divorced.  He has a Bachelors Degree in Math\nand Computer Science.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Software\nEngineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior).  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because his sexual behavior involved a criminal offense, is indicative of a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or may subject\nthe individual to undue influence or coercion, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  He admits that he is a sexual pervert and believes that he is now on the road\nto recovery.  \nSince the age of fourteen, when he was introduced to this conduct by a junior\nhigh school friend, the Applicant has engaged in perverted sexual activity, at times\nillegal and/or immoral and offensive to others.  From 1959, at fourteen years of age,\nuntil at least 2001, at the age of 56, the Applicant rubbed his penis, at times unexposed\nand other times fully exposed, on numerous occasions against unsuspecting female\u2019s\nbuttocks.  The Applicant explained that this was always a voluntary act on his part and\nhe engaged in this conduct about once a month on average for excitement.  He would\ngo to crowded places and target women that he felt attracted to.  \nOn one occasion, the Applicant was at a basketball game with his daughter when\nhe began rubbing his penis on a woman in the crowd.  He does not believe his daughter\nrealized what he was doing.    \nIn 1972, the Applicant began working for a defense contractor, and received his\nfirst security clearance in 1975.  He has held a security clearance from the Department\nof Defense since then.\nFrom 1965 to 1972, on numerous occasions, the Applicant has looked up\nwomen\u2019s dresses without their knowledge.  Except for the period between 1968 and\n1969 when the Applicant was drafted in the Army, he would crawl under cubicles in his\ncollege library to look between girl\u2019s legs at school.    \n\n3\nIn 1972, when the Applicant was no longer a student at that university, he\nreturned to the school library to look up girl\u2019s dresses.  On this occasion, he was\narrested and charged with Trespassing, barred from the campus, and required to serve\na probationary period.  (See Government Exhibit 2).      \nFrom 1965 through at least 1972, the Applicant has masturbated and rubbed his\npenis in public places to arouse himself.  The Applicant explained that he would sit next\nto a woman and use a book to rub his penis.  On some occasions he would arouse\nhimself to the point of ejaculation.  \nOn numerous other occasions, the Applicant explained that after making eye\ncontact with an attractive woman, he licks his lips in full view of an attractive woman\nbecause he finds it to be sexually arousing.  He has continued this activity until at least\n2004.    \nIn the early 1990's, the Applicant was caught rubbing his unexposed penis\nagainst a woman at the craps table at a casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.  He was detained\nby security and asked to leave and never return to the casino.  The Applicant admitted\nthat he engaged in this conduct on many other occasions and was not caught.  He\nexplained that he engaged in this conduct for the excitement of it all.  (See Government\nExhibit 2).\nThe Applicant was arrested on June 12, 1994, and charged with (1) Lewd or\nLascivious Acts with a Child 14 or 15 years old, (2) Sexual Battery, and (3) Indecent\nExposure.  He testified that this conduct occurred as he was exiting a movie theater\nwhen he had first rubbed his exposed penis on a mother and then on her child.  He\nexplained that at that time, he was trying to get aroused.  The Applicant was convicted\nof all three charges and sentenced to serve 60 days in jail (served during 29 1/2\nweekends), pay restitution to the victim, undergo counseling and was placed on three\nyears of supervised probation.  (See Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5).  As set forth\nbelow, the Applicant violated the terms of this probation and was sentenced to serve\n120 days in jail, which was stayed on three conditions: 1) the successful completion of\ncounseling with a Clinical Psychologist, 2) that he keep a sponsor in the sexual\ncounseling program, and 3) that he have no further violation.   \nA year later, and in violation of his earlier probation, on July 9, 1995, the\nApplicant was charged with (1) Sexual Battery, and (2) Disorderly Conduct.  This time\nhe was mingling in a crowd near some street performers and rubbed himself up against\na woman.  An undercover police officer arrested him.  He was found guilty of Count 1\nand sentenced to serve 30 days in the county jail, to serve 36 months on probation, pay\n$100.00 restitution and was required to under go counseling and attend 90 Sexual\nCompulsives Anonymous meetings within 120 days.  Since 1997, the Applicant has\nbeen required to register as a Sexual Offender in the State of California.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 3).       \n \n\n4\nFollowing his arrests in 1994, and 1995, the Applicant failed to report this\nadverse information to his company security officer.  He waited until his five year\nsecurity clearance update to disclose the information.\nThe Applicant testified that even though he is ashamed of this sexual\nmisconduct, he would not jeopardize the country\u2019s security if someone tried to use the\ninformation against him.  (Tr. p. 80).  He stated that he is on the road to recovery from\nhis sexual perversions.  He now avoids crowded environments or public places. \nThe Applicant\u2019s daughters, family and business associates are unaware of his\nsexual perversions and criminal sexual activities and he does not want them to know\nabout it.  His daughter and grand daughter currently live with him.  It is very stressful to\nthe Applicant and he constantly worries that someone may find out that he is a\nregistered sexual offender.  (Tr. p. 85).  \nThe Applicant was drafted into the Army during the Viet Nam war and served our\ncountry in the 25  Infantry Division for 22 months.  He served in Viet Nam for one year.\nth\nHe received the Silver Star, a very prestigious award given only to those engaged in\ncombat with the enemy. \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n(Guideline D (Sexual Behavior)\n12. The Concern.  Sexual Behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  No adverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be\nraise solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n13 (a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual was\nprosecuted;\n\n5\n13(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that\nthe person is unable to stop to that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder; \n13(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress;\n13(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or\njudgment.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\n\n6\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nAnalysis\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's questionable sexual behavior has a direct\nand negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  \nThe Applicant is an admitted sexual pervert who has engaged in inappropriate\nsexual behavior from 1959 to at least 2004.   At times his conduct was criminal, as\nevidenced by his two arrests in 1994 and 1995.  On numerous other occasions, his\nsexual misconduct was immoral and offensive.  He is a registered sex offender.  He has\nreceived counseling and psychiatric treatment for his sexual perversions.  He believes\nthat he is in recovery.  However, he does not want anyone to know about his sexual\nperversions and has kept it a secret from his family, friends and coworkers.  Following\nhis arrests, he did not inform his company security officer of this adverse information.\nConsidering this evidence in totality, this demonstrates a pattern of inappropriate sexual\nbehavior and high risk conduct that was careless, lacked discretion and good judgment\nand could subject him to pressure, coercion and/or blackmail, which in turn could\nsubject the Government to a security risk.  \nTh Applicant\u2019s high risk behavior places him in a vulnerable position to be\nsusceptible to pressure, coercion and/or blackmail.  He engaged in these activities after\n\n7\nhaving been granted a Security Clearance in 1975.  His questionable judgment and lack\nof discretion occurred as recently as 2004, just three years ago.  The Applicant states\nthat since 2001, he has taken measures to prevent his impulsive or planned sexual\nperverted activities by avoiding crowded and public places.  However, this pattern of\nhigh risk behavior is unacceptable while holding a security clearance and entrusted with\nthe national secrets.  The risk is great that he may fall prey to exploitation, coercion or\nduress.  Under Guideline D, Disqualifying Conditions 13 (a), \u201csexual behavior of a\ncriminal nature, whether or not the individual was prosecuted;\u201d 13(b), \u201ca pattern of\ncompulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to\nstop to that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder;\u201d 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that\ncauses an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress;\u201d and 13(d),\n\u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment,\u201d\napply.  None of the mitigating conditions are even remotely applicable.  The Applicant\nhas not met his burden of demonstrating that his sexual behavior does not raise a\nsecurity concern, and Guideline D is found against the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline D of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline D.\nFormal Findings\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against the Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n____________________________\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The materials supplied in support of a party\u2019s request become part of the record, but are not admitted as evidence. 6 The Appeal Board has adopted an entirely different procedure for administrative notice.

BRESLIN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a retired naval officer, who successfully held a security clearance during his\nmilitary career.  His wife is a naturalized citizen and resident of the U.S.  Her parents are citizens\nof the People\u2019s Republic of China and have permanent resident status in the United States.  She also\nhas a sister who is a citizen and resident of China.  Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising\nfrom possible foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant submitted an SF 86, Security Clearance Application, on June 6, 2001.  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\n\n2\nfor Applicant under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On\nJuly 7, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The\nSOR alleges security concerns raised under the Directive, specifically, Guideline B, Foreign\nInfluence.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 15, 2004.  He elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.\nThe case was originally assigned to other administrative judges, but was re-assigned to me\non November 28, 2005, because of workload considerations.  With the concurrence of Applicant and\nDepartment Counsel, I convened the hearing on April 10, 2006.  DOHA received the final transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) on May 3, 2006.  \nI issued a decision on May 24, 2006, granting Appellant a security clearance.  The\ngovernment appealed on several grounds, including my refusal to consider certain documents for the\npurpose of administrative notice.\nOn February 27, 2007, the Appeal Board found error in my refusal to take administrative\nnotice of Exhibit 7, and ordered that it be considered for this purpose.  The Appeal Board remanded\nthe case, and ordered that I re-convene the hearing and allow Department Counsel the opportunity\nto attempt to offer certain previously rejected documents as ordinary evidence, even though\nDepartment Counsel had made no such request in the first hearing.  (ISCR Case No. 03-21434 at 5\n(App. Bd. February 20, 2007).  \nWith the concurrence of both parties, I reconvened the hearing on April 3, 2007.  At the\nhearing on remand, I advised the parties that Exhibit 7 would be considered for the purposes of\nadministrative notice.  (Tr. at 3.)  As suggested by the Appeal Board, Department Counsel offered\nExhibit 9 as ordinary evidence.  For the reasons discussed below, I denied the request.  Appellant\noffered no additional evidence.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on remand on April\n11, 2007.\nEVIDENTIARY RULINGS\nThe Appeal Board found error in my refusal to admit Exhibit 7 for the purposes of\nadministrative notice.  It is helpful to review the concept of administrative notice, and the Appeal\nBoard\u2019s handling of this issues relating to administrative notice.\n\n3\nAdministrative Notice \nAdministrative notice is a legal concept similar to judicial notice, which allows an\nadministrative judge to consider certain facts without requiring the formal presentation of evidence.\nThe law recognizes two categories of facts that may be the subject of administrative notice:\n\u201clegislative facts\u201d and \u201cadjudicative facts.\u201d  The kinds of facts that may be administratively noticed\ndepends upon the function performed by the administrative judge.  (Kenneth Culp Davis, 1\nAdministrative Law Text, 3d Ed., \u00a7 15.03, West Publ. (1972).) \nIf the administrative judge is performing an essentially legislative or regulatory function, such\nas establishing soybean subsidies, setting highway tariffs for truckers, or allocating service areas for\ntelevision stations, he or she may consider \u201clegislative facts,\u201d a broad concept encompassing matters\nrelevant to the regulatory function.  (Id.)  These may include evidence of industry practices,\neconomic impact, scientific data, and agency expertise.  (Jacob Stein, et al, 1 Administrative Law,\n\u00a7 1.02[3], fn. 57, LexisNexis (2006).)  Also, appellate courts frequently go beyond the record for\nlegislative facts to guide the making of law and policy.  (Davis, 1 Administrative Law Text, 3d Ed.,\nsupra, at  \u00a7 15.03.)  The ability to find and rely on legislative facts is limited to administrative judges\nmaking similar public-policy decisions.  \nIf the administrative judge is performing an adjudicative function (i.e., determining individual\nrights or benefits), he or she may take administrative notice only of \u201cadjudicative facts.\u201d  Examples\nof adjudicative functions include settling FEMA claims, or deciding appeals from the denial of a\nsecurity clearance.  Because the adjudicative function directly affects the rights of a specific\nindividual, due process requires that the party be given notice of the proposed adjudicative fact and\nan opportunity to dispute it. \nI note some cases, such as hearing an immigrant\u2019s request for asylum, involve taking\nadministrative notice of public policy (i.e. \u201clegislative facts\u201d), as well as specific facts about an\nindividual (i.e. \u201cadjudicative facts\u201d).  In such cases, practitioners must be especially careful to\nconsider whether it is deciding a public policy (i.e., legislative) function or determining specific\nrelevant facts.  In Kowalczyk v. INS, 245 F.3d 11431147 (10th Cir. 2001), the court noted:\nHowever, \u201csimply because we have approved of [taking administrative notice] in one\ncontext does not mean that it is appropriate in all.  An agency\u2019s discretion to take\nadministrative notice depends on the particular case before it.\u201d  Llana-Castellon, 16\nF.3d at 1097; see also Castillo-Villagra v. INS, 16 F.32d 1017, 1027 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(\u201cThe administrative desirability of notice as a substitute for evidence cannot be\nallowed to outweigh fairness to individual litigants.\u201d\nThe purpose for taking administrative notice is convenience\u2013it avoids the difficulty and\nexpense of adducing testimony or evidence.  (Davis, 1 Administrative Law Text, 3d Ed., supra, at\n\u00a7 15.09.)  However, the desire for this convenience must be tempered by respect for the due process\nrights of the parties.  It would be unfair to notice contested facts subject to reasonable dispute, and\nrequire the opposing party to produce evidence in rebuttal or refutation at an administrative hearing\nwhere there is no subpoena power.  As Professor Davis wrote, \u201cconvenience should always yield to\nthe requirement of procedural fairness that parties should have the opportunity to meet in the\nappropriate fashion all facts that influence the disposition of the case.\u201d  (Id.)  \n\n4\nIn an adjudicative hearing, the nature of the matters that may be administratively noticed is\nlimited.  Only easily verifiable, indisputable facts are appropriate for administrative notice in an\nadjudicative hearing.  (ISCR Case No. 99-0511 (App. Bd. December 19, 2000).)  Facts to be\nadministratively noticed must be not subject to reasonable dispute and must be either generally\nknown within the area or capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose\naccuracy cannot be questioned.  For these reasons, an administrative judge normally may take\nadministrative notice only of general facts, not specific facts.  (Stein, et al, Administrative Law,\nsupra, at \u00a7 25.02.)\nThis is especially true of adjudicative facts.  The Supreme Court has held that the\ntypes of adjudicative facts subject to official notice include the fact that there is an\neconomic depression, but not how a particular industry has been affected by the\ndepression; the fact that Confederate money had depreciated during the course of the\nCivil War, but not the extent of depreciation.  The specifics, the Court has held, are\nthe subject of differences of opinion, even among experts, and must be proven by\npresentation of evidence, not official notice.\n(Id., citing Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, 301 U.S. 292, 300-02 (1937).) \na.  Scope of Administrative Notice\nDoD Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.19, provides that the Federal Rules of Evidence shall serve as\na guide for administrative hearings.  Fed. R. of Evid. 201, Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts,\nprovides useful guidance, especially because an administrative judge for DOHA is performing an\nadjudicative function.  The Advisory Committee\u2019s Note makes it clear the rule applies only to\nadjudicative facts, not legislative facts.  \nThe Appeal Board has not properly handled matters relating to administrative notice, to the\nprejudice of applicants.  This includes considering matters beyond the permissible scope of\nadministrative notice in adjudicative hearings, and engaging in improper fact-finding beyond the\nBoard\u2019s power of review.\nThe Appeal Board routinely allows government counsel to supplement the record with\nmaterial that is not a proper subject for administrative notice in an adjudicative hearing.  (ISCR Case\nNo. 03-08813 (App. Bd. November 15, 2005) (admitting any fact in any official \u201cpronouncement\u201d\nof the United States or an \u201cunofficial publication\u201d prepared by a private contractor for the U.S.);\nISCR Case No. 99-0452 (App. Bd. March 21, 2000) (admitting the content of official documents\nposted by federal departments or agencies on their website); ISCR Case 99-0511 (App. Bd.\nDecember 19, 2000) (admitting records that the U.S. sanctioned a project in a foreign country\nthrough foreign military aid and official U.S. cooperation); ISCR Case No. 02-29739 (App. Bd.\nOctober 13, 2005) (noticing specific properties of a drug from a medical text).  By allowing the\ngovernment to introduce and rely on matters exceeding the proper scope administrative notice, the\nAppeal Board is denying appellants the administrative due process granted by Executive Order\n12968, Sec. 5.2, and DoD Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 4 and \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nIn this case, the Appeal Board found error in declining to consider for the purpose of\nadministrative notice Exhibit 7, the February 2004 testimony of the Director, Defense Intelligence\n\n5\nAgency, before a Senate subcommittee.  The Board stated that \u201ccourts can and do take \u2018judicial\nnotice of the content of hearings and testimony before . . . congressional committees and\nsubcommittees . . . ,\u2019\u201d and cited two cases in support of the proposition.  However, a review of these\nauthorities reveals that both cases involve appellate courts noticing legislative facts; neither involves\na court considering adjudicative facts.  \nIn the first case, Adarand Constructors v. Slater, 228 F.3d 1147, 1168 at n.12 (10th Cir.\n2000), the appellate court considered the government\u2019s race- and gender-conscious contract program\nunder a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d test newly promulgated by the Supreme Court.  As the court explained,\n\u201cOur \u2018benchmark for judging the adequacy of the government's factual predicate for affirmative\naction legislation is whether there exists a \u2018strong basis in evidence for [the government\u2019s]\nconclusion that remedial action was necessary.\u2019\u201d  (Id. at 1166 (internal citations omitted).)  Although\nthe appellate court used the phrase \u201cjudicial notice,\u201d clearly the matters it noticed were legislative\nfacts, not adjudicative facts.  Indeed, in footnote 12 of the opinion, cited by the Appeal Board, the\ncourt commented, \u201cFurthermore, we note in passing that there is an even more substantial body of\nlegislative history supporting the compelling interest in the present case than that cited by the\ngovernment.\u201d  (Emphasis added.) \nThe Appeal Board also cited United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941), in which the\nSupreme Court considered the constitutionality of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  The Court\nspecifically took notice of the purpose of the Act, which was set out in the declaration of policy in\n\u00a7 2(a) of the Act, and in Senate and House of Representatives Committee reports.  Darby, 312 U.S.\nat 109.  This is a classic example of an appellate court taking notice of legislative facts for the\npurpose of determining policy.  It does not provide a legal basis for an administrative judge to notice\nlegislative facts to perform an adjudicative function.  \nb.  Unauthorized Fact-Finding.\nThe Appeal Board uses the guise of administrative notice to consider entire documents as\nevidence, instead of limiting itself to the notice of adjudicative facts.  This enables the Board to\nengage in improper de novo fact-finding, denying appellants the right to a fair hearing on appeal\nunder the Regulation.  \nThe normal process for taking judicial notice is for a party to request the judge to take notice\nof certain adjudicative facts, and to supply the court with the necessary information to support the\nrequest.  (Fed. R. Evid. 201(d).)  \u201cThe usual method of establishing adjudicative facts is through the\nintroduction of evidence, ordinarily consisting of the testimony of witnesses.\u201d  (Rule 201, Advisory\nCommittee\u2019s Note.)  Parties may also support requests for administrative notice by providing\ndocuments, such as official government publications relating to the subject at issue.  The opposing\nparty has the opportunity to object and to submit matters in opposition to the request.\nThe administrative judge takes administrative notice of adjudicative facts, not documents.\nThe facts administratively noticed become part of the administrative judge\u2019s findings of fact.  The\nmaterials supplied in support of a party\u2019s request become part of the record, but are not admitted as\nevidence.  \n\n6\nThe Appeal Board has adopted an entirely different procedure for administrative notice.\nWhere a party (almost always the government) offers a document to support a request for\nadministrative notice, the Board holds that the entire document is admitted into evidence.  The Board\nthen concludes that every fact asserted in the document is also evidence at the hearing and considers\nthose facts as conclusively established in conducting a de novo review of the case.  (See ISCR Case\nNo. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (the Appeal Board properly found error where the AJ\nfailed to consider a foreign country\u2019s record of hostility toward the U.S., but then the Board went on\nthe consider this fact in reversing the decision, stating \u201cExhibits introduced by Department Counsel\nclearly established this factual element . . . \u201d); ISCR Case No. 04-07766 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26,\n2006) (Appeal Board specifically relied on \u201cother record evidence not made the basis of a finding\nof fact by the Administrative Judge\u201d in reversing the decision); ISCR Case No. 04-08560 at 2 (App.\nBd. Oct.10, 2006) (explicitly relying on evidence \u201cnot made the basis for a finding of fact by the\nAdministrative Judge\u201d).\nOf course, the Appeal Board\u2019s authority is limited to issues of law; it has no authority to\nengage in fact-finding.  (DoD Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.29,  \u00b6 E3. 1.32.)  The Appeal Board has\nrepeatedly acknowledged this limitation on its authority.  (ISCR Case No. 03-19925 at 1 (App. Bd.\nAug 18, 2006) (the Board may not consider new evidence on appeal).)  \nc.  Notice requirement \nThe Appeal Board has made contradictory rulings about whether the parties must be informed\nof matters administratively noticed and provided an opportunity to challenge or respond to the\nproposed notice.  The Board has held that an administrative judge taking administrative notice is not\nrequired to inform the parties in advance or provide an opportunity to respond.  (See ISCR Case No.\n99-0452, 2000 DOHA LEXIS 108 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2000) (\u201cAs a general rule, the parties are\nentitled to know what information an Administrative Judge is relying on in making a decision. There\nare some narrow exceptions to this general rule: official or administrative notice, and matters known\nto an agency through its cumulative expertise.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 02-29739 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2005)\n(\u201cThis basic definition [from a medical dictionary] is not subject to reasonable dispute and as such\nis a proper subject for the taking of administrative notice.  Therefore the Judge\u2019s introduction of the\ndefinition into his factual findings did not require prior notice to the parties.\u201d).)\nAt other times the Board has recognized that when an administrative judge takes\nadministrative notice of an adjudicative fact, the parties must be given notice and an opportunity to\nrespond.  (See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (\u201cofficial or administrative notice\ncan be taken . . . .  Of course, such action should be undertaken with reasonable notice to applicants\nto avoid undue surprise or unfairness in these proceedings\u201d).\n2.  Admissibility Under the Federal Rules of Evidence\nAs noted above, the Appeal Board remanded the case with instructions that I take\nadministrative notice of Exhibit 7, and that I reconvene the hearing to allow Department Counsel the\nopportunity to attempt to admit the other excluded documents as ordinary evidence.  Department\nCounsel asked that I admit into evidence Exhibit 9, the annual report to Congress on foreign\n\n7\neconomic collection and industrial espionage prepared by the National Counterintelligence Center\nfor the year 2000.  (Tr. at 4.)  He offered several arguments in an attempt to demonstrate that Exhibit\n9 was both authentic and relevant.  (Tr. at 4-5.)  \na.  Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(4)\nDepartment Counsel argued that the authenticity of the document was established under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(4).  Generally, Rule 901(a) provides, \u201cThe requirement of\nauthentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence\nsufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d\nSubparagraph (b) of the rule offers illustrations of the types of evidence which could prove\nauthenticity of a document, such as: (1) testimony of a witness with knowledge, (2) opinion of a non-\nexpert witness concerning the genuineness of handwriting, or (3) the in-court comparison of writing\nsamples by the trier of fact or an expert witness.  \nIn this case, Department Counsel argued that I should find the document to be authentic\nunder Rule 901(b)(4), \u201cAppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive\ncharacteristics, taken in conjunction with the circumstances.\u201d  Courts often admit documents under\nthis rule, where other evidence demonstrates that the distinctive characteristics of the document\nestablish its authenticity.  (See United States v. Firischak, 468 F.3d 1015, 1022 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(expert\u2019s testimony about contents, location, and appearance of documents sufficient for\nauthentication); United States v. Thompson, 449 F.3d 267, 274 (1  Cir. 2006) (anonymous letter met\nst\nauthentication requirement through circumstantial indicia of authorship); U.S. v. Gordon, 634 F.2d\n639, 643 (1st Cir. 1980) (documents authenticated by evidence corroborating distinctive content and\ncharacteristics).) However, Department Counsel did not indicate what specific characteristics of the\ndocument proved its authenticity.  He argued only that it was (1) a document, and (2) contained\ninformation prepared by several federal agencies.  (Tr. at 5.)  Department Counsel did not indicate\nwhat specific information within Exhibit 9 for Identification was so unique or distinctive that it\nproved its genuineness.  I considered the document offered as Exhibit 9 and find none of the unique\ncharacteristics probative of authenticity under Rule 901(b)(4).  \nb.  Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(7)\nDepartment Counsel argued that Exhibit 9 was admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence\n901(b)(7).  The rule, in pertinent part, provides that a proponent may establish authenticity of a\npublic record or report by presenting \u201cEvidence that a . . . purported public record, report, statement,\nor data compilation, in any form is from the office where items of this nature are kept.\u201d  The\nAdvisory Committee\u2019s Note to the Rule indicates \u201cPublic records are regularly authenticated by\nproof of custody, without more.\u201d  Finally, I note that Rule 1005 specifically provides that the\ncontents of public records \u201cmay be proved by copy, certified as correct in accordance with Rule 902\nor testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original.\u201d  In practice, public\nrecords are authenticated by having the custodian of the record submit a certificate attesting to the\nauthority of the custodian and that the documents are public records.  No such evidence was\npresented in this case. \nc.  Federal Rule of Evidence 902(5)\n\n8\nDepartment Counsel also maintained that Exhibit 9 for Identification was self-authenticating\nas an official publication under Rule 902(5).  Federal Rule of Evidence 905(5) provides, \u201cExtrinsic\nevidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to admissibility is not required with respect to the\nfollowing: . . .  (5) Official publications.  Books, pamphlets, or other publications purporting to be\nissued by public authority.\u201d  Under this rule, official publications of the U.S. government are self-\nproving, making it relatively simple to establish the authenticity of such a document.  As the court\nobserved in Lorraine v. Markel Am. Ins. Co., 241 F.R.D. 534 (D. Md. 2007), \u201cWhen combined with\nthe public records exception to the hearsay rule, Rule 803(8), these official publications posted on\ngovernment agency websites should be admitted into evidence easily.\u201d \nThe concern in this case is that the document offered as Exhibit 9 was not from an official\ngovernment website.  The Appeal Board specifically commented, \u201cWe also note that Exhibit 9\nappears to have been obtained from a non-governmental web site, which impairs its status as an\nofficial publication of the United States.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 03-21434 at n.5 (App. Bd. Feb. 20,\n2007).)  Absent some other evidence from the government, I hesitate to conclude that Exhibit 9 is\nan official government publication where the Appeal Board previously ruled in the same case that\nits status was questionable. \nAssuming arguendo that Exhibit 9 is self-proving under Rule 902(5), that does not mean it\nis admissible.  The rule \u201c[dispenses] with preliminary proof of the genuineness of purportedly\nofficial publications . . . . [but] does not confer admissibility upon all official publications; it merely\nprovides a means whereby their authenticity may be taken as established for purposes of\nadmissibility.\u201d  (Fed. R. Evid. 902(5), Advisory Committee\u2019s Note.) \nIt is axiomatic that evidence must be relevant to be admissible.  (Fed. R. Evid. 402.)  At the\ninitial hearing on this case, I did not admit Exhibit 9 largely because it was not relevant.  First, it was\nrather old, and I admitted Exhibit 10, a more recent version of the same report.  Secondly, it was not\nrelevant because it repeated information already presented in Exhibit 10 and other documents.\nDepartment Counsel maintained the 2000 report was necessary because it listed the countries thought\nto be the most active collectors of foreign economic information.  I noted the list was the result of\na survey of \u201cnearly a dozen selected Fortune 500 companies.\u201d  However, the report does not indicate\nwhat companies were selected, how they were selected, who selected them, or who provided the\nresponses.  Moreover, the survey focused on the collection, by legal and illegal means, of foreign\neconomic information generally, rather than espionage having security significance.  Therefore, I\nfound the proffered exhibit incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial to the issues in this case.  \nThe Appeal Board considered these rulings carefully, and noted that I found \u201cthe appendix\nappeared to be based upon insufficient data to be relevant.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 03-21434 at 4 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 20, 2007.)  The Appeal Board specifically held \u201cwe find no basis to conclude that he abused\nhis discretion\u201d in this ruling.  In the absence of some additional evidence, I find Exhibit 9 is still not\nrelevant.  I also find it is not material, especially in light of the other documents properly considered\nin this case.\nIn the opinion remanding this case, the Appeal Board noted that the Federal Rules of\nEvidence serve only as a guide, and may be relaxed by the administrative judge.  (ISCR Case No.\n03-21434 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb 20, 2007).)  DoD Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.19, provides:\n\n9\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) shall serve as a guide.\nRelevant and material evidence may be received subject to rebuttal, and technical\nrules of evidence may be relaxed, except as otherwise provided herein, to permit the\ndevelopment of a full and complete record.\nUnder the terms of the Directive, only \u201ctechnical\u201d rules of evidence may be relaxed.  More\nsignificantly, the rule makes it clear that only relevant and material evidence may be received.  Even\nif one relaxed the technical rules concerning authentication, Exhibit 9 is still not relevant or material.\nTherefore it will not be considered in this case.\nFinally, I note that we do not take administrative notice of documents; rather, we take\nadministrative notice of adjudicative facts.  The documents submitted by the parties serve only to\nsupport requests for administrative notice, and do not constitute independent evidence.  I considered\ncarefully the relevant and material documents, including Exhibit 7, as ordered by the Appeal Board.\nThe adjudicative facts I administratively noticed are set out in my factual findings, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted, in whole or in part, the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f\nof the SOR.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated July 15, 2004.)  Those admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  He denied the allegations in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR.  (Id.)  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant was born in December 1949.  (Ex. 1 at 1.)  He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in\nSeptember 1969.  (Ex. 1 at 6; Ex. 3 at 2.)  Applicant was rated as an Electrician\u2019s Mate and served\naboard nuclear submarines, where he held a security clearance.  For his exceptional performance,\nApplicant was selected as the best sailor in the submarine force in 1978.  (Tr. at 60; Ex. A at 10.)\nIn September 1984, he received a Navy Commendation Medal for his exemplary service.  (Ex. A at\n5.)  Applicant rose to the rank of Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8).  (Ex. 3 at 6.)\nIn 1984, Applicant applied for the Navy\u2019s limited duty officer program.  His commander\nstrongly endorsed the application, and praised Applicant\u2019s record of dedicated performance of duty.\n(Ex. A at 6-7.)  Previous commanders added their emphatic endorsements.  (Ex. A at 8, 9, 14, 15.)\nThe Navy accepted him into the program and awarded him a commission.  (Tr. at 60; Ex. A at 12.)\nIn June 1987, he qualified as a Surface Warfare Officer.  (Ex. A at 11.)  Applicant worked in the\nnuclear engineering field and held a high-level security clearance from about 1984 until he retired\nfrom the U.S. Navy in 1991.  (Ex. 1 at 6; Ex. 3 at 2.)  \nApplicant was married in November 1971.  (Ex. 3 at 3.)  By the early 1990s, Applicant and\nhis wife developed marital difficulties.  He filed for divorce, but allowed it to lapse.  (Tr. at 64.)\nThey continued to reside in the same house, but not as husband and wife.  (Id.)  His wife moved from\nthe marital home in March 1997.  (Ex. 4.)  Applicant was divorced from his wife in December 1998.\n(Ex. 3 at 3.) \nIn 1991, shortly after his retirement from the Navy, he purchased a travel agency and\noperated the business for about six years.  (Id.)  In 1996, he was asked to provide travel assistance\n\n10\nto a group of businessmen from the People\u2019s Republic of China (P.R.C.) who were having troubles\nwith airline tickets and hotel reservations.  (Tr. at 65, 70.)  Applicant helped the group with their\narrangements and met the Chinese travel agent accompanying them, along with his female assistant\nwho served as a translator.  (Tr. at 65.)  As travel agents, each was interested in making contact with\nan agency in the other country in an attempt to facilitate each other\u2019s tours.  (Tr. at 68.)  The Chinese\ntravel agent arranged for Applicant to take a tour of China for about two weeks in March 1996.  (Tr.\nat 69.)  The Chinese travel agent\u2019s female assistant served as his tour guide and translator.  (Tr. at\n71-72.)  \nApplicant believed the tour package he was shown would be highly profitable and\ncompetitive with larger companies.  (Tr. at 74.)  He later arranged a group tour of China for clients,\nand visited the P.R.C. in June 1996 to arrange for visas and tickets.  (Ex. 3 at 3.)  The travel\nassistant/translator again served as his guide.  (Id.)  During this trip, they became romantically\ninvolved.  (Tr. at 78; Ex. 3 at 3.)  \nOver the ensuing months, Applicant returned to China several times to pursue his relationship\nwith her, to meet her parents, to arrange trips for clients, and for his personal travel in the region.\n(Ex. 1 at 7; Ex. 3 at 3; Tr. at 86.)  After a significant set-back in the travel industry, Applicant sold\nhis travel agency in about April 1997.  (Tr. at 100.)  He began working as an independent contractor\ndoing small home repair.  (Tr. at 100; Ex. 1 at 2.)  \nHe continued to travel to China to further the relationship.  In January 1999, Applicant\nbrought her to the U.S. and they were married in February 1999.  (Ex. 3 at 3.)\nApplicant then worked for about one year as the comptroller for a sports company.  (Ex. 1\nat 2.)  In May 2001, he assumed his present position with a defense contractor serving as a senior\nnuclear test engineer.  (Ex. 1 at 1; Ex. 2 at 2.)  \nApplicant currently lives with his second wife, their daughter, and his wife\u2019s parents.  (Tr.\nat 62.)  His wife\u2019s parents care for their child.  (Tr. at 89.)  \nApplicant is active in the local community; he has worked with the boy scouts for 20 years,\ntaught hunting safety courses, instructed grade school students in archery and wilderness survival\ncourses, and worked with the 4-H Club.  (Tr. at 59.)  He was nominated as the Military Citizen of\nthe Year for 1990 for his support to the community.  (Ex. A at 2.)  \nHe obtained a bachelor of arts degree, cum laude, in 1994.  (Ex. A at 3.)  At the time of the\nhearing, he was pursuing a master\u2019s degree in business administration specializing in criminal justice\nadministration and expecting to graduate in June 2006, magna cum laude.  (Ex. A at 4; Tr. at 59,\n104.)  \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in 1973.  (Tr. at 79.)  She received an academic scholarship and\nattended college in China where she studied tourism.  (Tr. at 79, 96.)  She was not a member of the\nCommunist Party.  (Tr. at 96.)  She became a U.S. citizen in February 2004.  (Ex. C.)  She is\ncurrently a student at a U.S. law school.\n\n11\nApplicant\u2019s wife has one sister, who is a citizen and resident of the P.R.C.  (Tr. at 81.)  The\nsister works in real estate with her husband.  (Tr. at 82.)  They have one child.  (Tr. at 93.)  Applicant\nand his wife are not close to her sister.  (Tr. at 82.)  \nHis wife\u2019s parents are citizens of the P.R.C.  Her father was a professional soccer player for\na city team and her mother worked in a factory.  (Tr. at 97.)  They came from affluent families and\nwere anti-communist.  (Tr. at 95.)  During the Cultural Revolution in China, they were required to\nwork on a labor farm.  (Tr. at 88.)  Both parents are now over 60 years old and are retired.  (Tr. at\n94.)  They receive a small pension from the government that goes into a bank account in China.  (Tr.\nat 97.)  They came to the U.S. in 2003.  (Tr. at 89) They have permanent resident status in the United\nStates.  (Ex. D.)  In about 2005, her parents went back to China for her mother\u2019s medical treatment\nin order to take advantage of lower costs, but later returned to the U.S.  (Tr. at 88, 93.)  Applicant\nnow provides medical insurance coverage for them.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts.  According to the U.S. State Department,\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China is controlled by the Communist Party.  (Ex. 5 at 1.)  The Consular\nInformation Sheet indicates Chinese security personnel may place under surveillance business people\nwith access to advanced proprietary information.  (Id. at 2.)  The People\u2019s Republic of China is a\ncollector of foreign intelligence.  (Ex. 7 at 10-11.)  The U.S. State Department reports that terrorism\nis rare in China and that there \u201cis no indication that acts of public violence have been directed against\nforeigners or that foreign elements in China have carried out terrorist attacks.\u201d  (Ex. 5 at 2-3.)  The\nState Department also reports that China\u2019s record on human rights is poor.  (Ex. 11.) \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988).)  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified\ninformation within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.   Under the\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1, the adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s\nimmediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be bound\nby affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be\nsubject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence\nthat could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens\nof other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security\ndeterminations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure. \n\n12\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could\nmitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed in the\nconclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6\nE2.2.1.)  An administrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully\nweigh the available, reliable information about the person.  (Id.)  An administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (Id.) \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  (Directive,\n\u00b6 E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).)  \u201cAny doubt as to whether\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.) \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7\n7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nLEGAL PRECEDENT\nIt is helpful to review the legal precedents relevant to Guideline B cases established by the\nDOHA Appeal Board.  As noted above, Guideline B of the Directive addresses potential security\nconcerns arising when applicants may be subject to foreign influence. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s\nimmediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be bound\nby affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be\nsubject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence\nthat could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens\nof other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security\ndeterminations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure. \n\n13\n(Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1, emphasis added.)  It is important to note that the Directive does not establish\na per se rule for the guideline; for example, the mere fact that family members or friends are citizens\nor residents of a foreign country is not automatically disqualifying.  The Appeal Board has\nacknowledged many times that the: \nmere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter\nof law, automatically disqualifying . . . .  [It] does raise a prima facie security concern\nsufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or\nmitigation sufficient to meet the applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\napplicant.  \n(ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).)\nIn order for many diverse adjudicators, counsel, and administrative judges to apply this\nguideline uniformly and consistently, the Directive sets out various conditions illustrating the sort\nof matters that may raise security concerns and those that might alleviate such concerns.  The\nDirective refers to these as potentially \u201cdisqualifying\u201d or \u201cmitigating\u201d conditions.  An administrative\njudge must consider these conditions as part of a \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in determining whether\na security concern exists and whether an applicant has mitigated or extenuated those concerns.\nMitigating Condition 1\nUnder Guideline B, Mitigating Condition 1 (Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1) provides that it is\npotentially mitigating where the \u201cassociate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a\nposition to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose\nbetween loyalty to the person involved and the United States.\u201d  Notwithstanding the facially\ndisjunctive language, applicants must establish both: (1) that the individuals in question are not\n\u201cagents of a foreign power,\u201d and (2) that they are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power\nin a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United\nStates.  (ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004).)  \n\u201cAgent of a Foreign Power\u201d\nThe Appeal Board has greatly reduced the applicability of this potentially mitigating\ncondition by adopting an expansive definition of the phrase \u201cagent of a foreign power.\u201d  The federal\nstatute dealing with national security and access to classified information, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(6),\nincludes a definition for the term \u201cagent of a foreign power.\u201d  For the purposes of the statute,\nCongress adopted the definitions of the phrases \u201cforeign power\u201d and \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d from\n50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a) and (b), respectively.  50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b) defines \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d\nto include anyone who acts as an officer or employee of a foreign power in the United States,\nengages in international terrorism, or engages in clandestine intelligence activities in the U.S.\ncontrary to the interests of the U.S. or involving a violation of the criminal statutes of the United\nStates.  The definition was added to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438 by the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal\nYear 1995, Public Law 103-359, October 14, 1994.  The term was subsequently included in the\nDirective through Change 4, dated April 20, 1999. \n\n14\nThe Appeal Board, however, does not apply the statutory definition of \u201cagent of a foreign\npower.\u201d  Instead, it adopted a much broader definition of its own invention.  The Appeal Board\nseems to have taken the definition of \u201cforeign power\u201d from 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a), but then uses a\ngeneral definition for the term \u201cagent,\u201d so that the phrase has the widest possible scope, to include\nanyone who has any connection to any government within a foreign country.  \nFollowing this expansive construction, the Appeal Board has held that, \u201cAn employee of a\nforeign government need not be employed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence,\nmilitary, or other national security duties to be an agent of a foreign power for purposes of Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 02-24254, 2004 WL 2152747 (App. Bd. Jun.\n29, 2004).)  The Appeal Board applies its definition very broadly.  (See ISCR Case No. 03-10954\nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (attorney/consultant to an entity controlled by a foreign ministry is an\n\u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d); ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2006) (part-time\nsecretary for the Ministry of Religion is an \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d); ISCR Case No. 02-2454 at\n4-5 (App. Bd. June 29, 2004) (employee of a city government was an \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d);\nISCR Case No. 03-04090 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2005) (employee of the Israeli government is an\n\u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d); ISCR Case No.02-29143 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2005) (a member of\na foreign military is an \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d).)  The effect of the Appeal Board\u2019s broad\napplication of this term is to greatly increase the numbers of applicants who are automatically\nexcluded from the provisions of Mitigating Condition 1.\nVery recently, the Appeal Board explained its refusal to use the statutory definition of the\nterm.  In ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006), the Board opined that the definition\nof \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b) did not apply because it is part of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and that statute had a narrower scope than the security concerns\nin the Directive.  However, the Appeal Board did not explain why the definition would not apply\nwhere it was specifically incorporated by reference  in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438, the federal statute directly\nconcerning the grant of access to classified information.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s position is inconsistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Directive.\nHad the drafters intended to exclude all relatives and associates who were \u201cconnected to a foreign\ngovernment,\u201d they would have employed such terminology; indeed, that very language was used in\nDisqualifying Condition 3 of Guideline B.  Moreover, for the drafters to use that language as the\nbasis for Disqualifying Condition 3 and then repeat it as an exception to Mitigating Condition 1 is\nnot logical.  The only reasonable and rational interpretation is that the phrase \u201cagent of a foreign\npower\u201d is a term of art defined by 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(6), the statute dealing with access to classified\ninformation.  The Appeal Board\u2019s decision not to use the statutory definition of the term greatly\nrestricts the applicability of Mitigating Condition 1 for applicants. \n\u201cIn a Position to be Exploited\u201d\nAs noted above, the second prong of Mitigating Condition 1 (Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1)\nprovides that it is potentially mitigating where the \u201cassociate(s) in question are not . . . in a position\nto be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty\nto the person involved and the United States.\u201d  The language \u201cin a position to be exploited\u201d is\nsubject to interpretation.  As discussed below, the reasonable and rational interpretation consistent\nwith the intent of the Directive is that the language requires a judge to consider all the circumstances,\n\n15\nassess the likelihood of improper exploitation, and determine whether it presents an unreasonable\nsecurity concern.  \nThe Appeal Board applies Mitigating Condition 1 very narrowly, however.  The Appeal\nBoard interprets the language as establishing an absolute standard; i.e., an applicant must\naffirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence a\nforeign relative or acquaintance in the future.  (See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17,\n2006) (\u201cMC1 does not apply because, as is well settled, it requires that Applicant demonstrate that\nhis relatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty to them\nand his loyalty to the United States.\u201d).)  The Appeal Board does not permit an administrative judge\nto engage in a balancing test to assess the extent of any security risk in a case.  Rather, the Appeal\nBoard requires an applicant to prove that the presence of family members in a foreign country does\nnot create even the possibility of pressure or coercion in the future.  (ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5\n(App. Bd. Feb 15, 2005).)  In determining the applicability of this potentially mitigating condition,\nthe Appeal Board does not consider whether an applicant is likely to be improperly influenced by\na foreign relative, holding that \u201cForeign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 hinges not on what choice\nApplicant might make if he is forced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United\nStates, but rather hinges on the concept that Applicant should not be placed in a position where he\nis forced to make such a choice.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005); see\nalso ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 8 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005).) \nBecause the Appeal Board has set an absolute standard, it refuses to allow an administrative\njudge to consider any evidence that does not conclusively establish the impossibility of a future\nattempt at influence.  Even though \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1, E2.2.2, and E2.2.3 of the Directive specifically require\nan administrative judge to consider all the facts and circumstances when evaluating each individual\ncase, the Appeal Board nonetheless holds it is error for a judge to do so when considering the\napplicability of Mitigating Condition 1.  For example, the Appeal Board finds it legal error to\nconsider any of the following facts because they are not \u201cdispositive\u201d: a foreign relative\u2019s fragile\nhealth (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)); a foreign relative\u2019s advanced age\n(ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)); a foreign relative\u2019s financial independence\n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the number of family members in a\nforeign country  (ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005)); the fact that foreign\nrelatives spend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22,\n2005)); the lack of any connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in\nquestion (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at\nexploitation in the past (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); the lack of a\nrelative\u2019s financial dependency upon an applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21,\n2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its stable, democratic government,\nor its extensive foreign military agreements with the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App.\nBd. Oct. 27, 2005)).\nWhile the Appeal Board refuses to consider any facts tending to mitigate security concerns\nunder Mitigating Condition 1, it absolutely requires judges to consider factors that might increase\nsecurity concerns.  For example, while the Appeal Board holds it is error for an administrative judge\nto consider a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., it also holds that it is error for a\njudge to fail to consider a hostile relationship between the U.S. and a foreign country.  (ISCR Case\nNo. 02-13595 at 4 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005).)  Similarly, the Appeal Board holds that a foreign\n\n16\nstate\u2019s favorable human rights record is irrelevant, but that \u201ca country\u2019s poor human rights record\nand its differences with the United States on important security issues such as terrorism are factors\u201d\nthat a judge must consider.  (ISCR Case No. 04-05317 at 5 (App. Bd. June 3, 2005).)  \nThe general rules of statutory construction apply to administrative regulations.  (M. Kraus\n& Bros. v. U.S., 327 U.S. 614, 621 (1946); 2 Am. Jur. 2d Administrative Law \u00a7 245 (2006).)\nHowever, ordinary rules of regulatory construction do not support the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation\nof the language in question.  \nThe primary rule of regulatory construction is to determine the intent of the drafters and to\ngive it effect.  To that end, judges must interpret a regulation consistent with the purpose and policy\nwithin the overall regulatory plan.  (Public Citizen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440,\n454-55 (1989); Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir.), aff\u2019d, 326 U.S. 404 (1945).)  The\nDirective does not establish per se rules prohibiting the issuance of security clearances in specific\nsituations. To the contrary, it requires administrative judges to balance various factors\u2013some\npotentially disqualifying, and some potentially mitigating\u2013to determine whether an individual is a\nsecurity concern.  To that end, \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive provides general guidance:\n6.3.  Each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information\nand the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as\nappropriate:\n6.3.1.  Nature a seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.\n6.3.2.  Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n6.3.3.  Age of the applicant.\n6.3.4.  Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was\nnegligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences involved.\n6.3.5.  Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\n6.3.6.  Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s narrow interpretation creates a requirement of proof impossible to achieve and\neffectively eliminates the possibility that Mitigating Condition 1 could ever apply.  Also, the Appeal\nBoard\u2019s rulings exclude from consideration all evidence that could tend to mitigate or extenuate the\npotential security concern.  Clearly, the Appeal Board\u2019s inflexible interpretation of the language\nwould \u201ccompel an odd result.\u201d  (Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U.S. 504, 509 (1989).)\nThis is inconsistent with the regulatory policy established in the Directive, and effectively denies due\nprocess to applicants.\nAnother rule of regulatory construction is that judges should not interpret language in such\na way that renders it meaningless or leads to an absurd result.  (United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S.\n576, 580 (1981).)  Of course, the issue of the applicability of Mitigating Condition 1 only arises\nwhen an applicant has immediate family members or close acquaintances who are citizens or\nresidents of a foreign country.  The Appeal Board presumes that the fact of such foreign citizenship\nor residency creates a vulnerability to possible influence.  Under such circumstances, it is impossible\n\n17\nfor an applicant to affirmatively prove that no attempt at exploitation or influence could ever occur\nin the future.  It is not logical that the drafters of the Directive would implement a mitigating\ncondition that could never apply.\nIt is helpful to consider the historical antecedents for this provision to shed light on the\ndrafter\u2019s intent.  The version of Mitigating Condition 1 set out in DoD Directive 5220.6 promulgated\nin January 1992, couched this mitigating condition in these terms.  \u201cConditions that could mitigate\nsecurity concerns include: (1) a determination that the immediate family member(s) , cohabitant, or\nassociate(s) in question would not constitute an unacceptable security risk.\u201d  Clearly, the earlier\nversion of MC1 did not establish a per se rule\u2013rather it required the administrative judge to weigh\nall factors and determine whether the risk was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d  \nSignificantly, this earlier version of Mitigating Condition 1 is still in effect for security\nclearance cases for military members and civilian employees of DoD that are processed under DoD\nRegulation 5200.2-R.  It is anomalous to apply a per se rule in some cases and a rule of\nreasonableness in others, where the implementing regulations require a uniform process.\nIt is also helpful to review a later-enacted version of the same guideline to determine the\ndrafter\u2019s original intent.  (Branch v. Smith, 538 U.S. 254, 281 (2003) (citing United States v.\nFreeman, 44 U.S. 556 (1845).)  On December 29, 2005, the President approved the following new\nlanguage to replace Mitigating Condition 1:\n8.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (a) the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which the persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\nNotably, the new language requires an administrative judge to weigh numerous factors and assess\nthe likelihood that an individual will be placed in a position of conflict.  Unlike the Appeal Board\u2019s\npresent interpretation, the new language does not require an applicant to affirmatively prove that an\nattempt at influence is impossible, nor does it bar consideration of evidence that might mitigate or\nextenuate security concerns.  Most importantly, when one consider\u2019s the previous version of this\nrule, the general policy of the Directive, and this recent language, it is apparent that the drafters did\nnot intend the present language to be interpreted as a per se rule as the Appeal Board now applies\nit.\nTerrorism\nThe Appeal Board also construes Mitigating Condition 1 to make it inapplicable any time\nthere is a history of terrorist acts within the foreign country in question.  Obviously, this greatly\ndecreases the chance that any applicant could obtain the benefit of Mitigating Condition 1.\nAs noted above, Mitigating Condition 1 applies where a judge determines the applicant\u2019s\nrelatives and associates in a foreign country are not \u201cin a position to be exploited by a foreign power\nin a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the\n\n18\nUnited States.\u201d  While the definition of \u201cforeign power\u201d from 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(6) (incorporating the\ndefinition from 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a)) includes terrorist groups, it also includes foreign governments,\nforeign-based political organizations, and foreign non-governmental organizations.  \nMitigating Condition 1 does not, by its express terms, exclude from consideration applicants\nwith relatives or associates in countries where terrorism has occurred, any more than it excludes\nperson from countries where there are foreign governments, foreign political organizations, or\nforeign non-governmental organizations.  Rather, it focuses on a very specific type of threat\u2013the risk\nof a foreign power exploiting an applicant\u2019s foreign relatives in such a way as to cause an applicant\nto act adversely to the interests of the United States.  \nThe Appeal Board holds Mitigating Condition 1 does not apply where there is a history of\nterrorist activity\u2013of any kind\u2013in the foreign country in question.  (ISCR Case No. 03-22643, 2005\nDOHA Lexis 159 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22,\n2005).)  The Appeal Board justifies this as \u201ca matter of common sense\u201d arising from \u201cthe war on\nterrorism.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 01-26893, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 505, 22-23 n.2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16,\n2002).)  To appreciate the extent to which the Appeal Board will consider the risk of terrorist acts,\nit is helpful to review the opinion in ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004).  There\nthe Appeal Board declared \u201cit is possible to envision several ways in which terrorists could pose a\nthreat to classified information,\u201d and then went on to theorize extensively about what unspecified\nterrorists might do in hypothetical situations.  While such things are possible, they do not fall within\nthe limited language contained in Mitigating Condition 1 of the Directive.  The fact that the U.S. is\npresently engaged in a war on terrorism is a matter to be considered along with all relevant facts;\nhowever, it does not amend Mitigating Condition 1 in the Directive.\n\u201cHeavy Reliance\u201d\nUnder the Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.3, the Appeal Board\u2019s authority is limited to issues of law\u2013it\ndoes not have the authority to conduct a de novo review of the case.  To reverse the decision of an\nadministrative judge, the Appeal Board must find a \u201clegal\u201d error.  Frequently in cases under\nGuideline B, the Appeal Board finds legal error by concluding an administrative judge relied too\nheavily on a particular factor.\nAs noted above, the Appeal Board decided that evidence that a foreign country is hostile to\nthe U.S. is so significant that it is legal error for an administrative judge to fail to consider it.  At the\nsame time, however, the Appeal Board holds that the fact that a foreign country has friendly relations\nwith the U.S., or that it has long been a U.S. ally, is irrelevant.  Moreover, when an administrative\njudge notes the history of friendly relations as part of the required discussion of all the facts, the\nAppeal Board infers \u201cheavy reliance\u201d by the administrative judge upon that fact and holds it was\nlegal error.  \nFor example, in ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 WL 1381919 (Jan. 2, 2005), the\nadministrative judge considered the security risk arising from an applicant\u2019s relatives in Taiwan.  The\njudge wrote that \u201cThe following information about Taiwan . . . is significant,\u201d and discussed the\nevidence the government counsel submitted for administrative notice.  Later, while discussing the\napplicability of potentially mitigating conditions, the judge noted Taiwan\u2019s friendly relationship with\nthe U.S.  The judge went on to discuss at length specific facts unique to Applicant\u2019s situation making\n\n19\nhim a good candidate for a clearance, and eventually found in his favor.  On appeal, the Appeal\nBoard reasoned that the judge erred in relying too heavily on the finding that Taiwan was friendly.\n(ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005).)  \nThe Appeal Board often employs this analysis to reverse decisions granting clearances under\nGuideline B.  In ISCR Case No. 02-21927 at 7 (Jan. 18, 2005), the administrative judge noted it was\n\u201chelpful to consider several factors, including the character of the foreign country,\u201d and discussed\nvarious aspects of Saudi Arabia\u2019s government.  The Appeal Board concluded this demonstrated\ninappropriate \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on the fact that Saudi Arabia is an ally of the U.S.  (ISCR Case No.\n02-21927 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2005).)  (See also ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-23860, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 43 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR Case\nNo. 03-23806, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 162 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-02892, 2004\nDOHA LEXIS 621 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-11570, 2004 DOHA LEXIS 653\n(App. Bd. May 19, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 (App. Bd. Mar. 29,\n2002).) \nShifting Burden of Proof/Persuasion\nThe Appeal Board frequently finds \u201clegal error\u201d by deciding that an administrative judge\nimproperly shifted the burden of proof/persuasion to the government to disprove the application of\nMitigating Condition 1.  (The Appeal Board uses the terms \u201cburden of proof\u201d and \u201cburden of\npersuasion\u201d interchangeably; a discussion of the merits of that practice is beyond the scope of this\ndiscussion.)  A careful examination of the cases in question reveals the Appeal Board\u2019s rationale for\nfinding error is insufficient to justify reversing the decision of an administrative judge.\nAccording to the Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14, the department counsel is responsible for presenting\nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The Appeal Board\ninterprets this as imposing on department counsel the burden of proving by substantial evidence that\na disqualifying condition applies.  (ISCR Case No. 02-30587, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 73 (App. Bd. Jun.\n15, 2005).)  Thereafter, an Applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\nsecurity clearance.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  \nIn cases arising under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, the Appeal Board holds an applicant\nmust affirmatively prove that no one would in the future attempt to exploit them through their\nforeign relatives or associates.  (As discussed above, this imposes the impossible burden of\naffirmatively proving that an event will not occur in the future.)  In order for an applicant to persuade\nan administrative judge that he or she is not \u201cin a position to be exploited by a foreign power,\u201d he\nor she often must rely on evidence that a foreign country has not engaged in exploitive behavior in\nthe past, including the absence of any evidence of improper conduct.  However, any time an\nadministrative judge comments on the absence of evidence, the Appeal Board concludes the\nadministrative judge improperly shifted the burden of proof to the government to disprove a\nmitigating condition.  (ISCR Case No. 03-15485 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382\n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-20908 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2003).)  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s rulings appear to be based upon the premise that \u201cwhen a party has the\nburden of proof on a particular point, the absence of any evidence on that point requires a Judge to\nfind or conclude that point against the party that has the burden of proof.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 99-0597,\n\n20\n2000 DOHA LEXIS 229 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000).)  However, the concept that the \u201cabsence of\nevidence\u201d must always be deemed a failure of proof by the proponent is contrary to prevailing federal\npractice.  Indeed, the concept that the absence of evidence can be used to prove a negative\nproposition is so well ingrained in the law that it is included among the statutory exceptions to the\nhearsay rule in Federal Rule of Evidence 803(7) (absence of entry in records of a regularly conducted\nactivity) and Rule 803(10) (absence of public record or entry).\nAn applicant attempting to prove the applicability of Mitigating Condition 1 has the burden\nof proving a negative, i.e., that a foreign power is not likely to engage in exploitive conduct in the\nfuture, or has not done so in the past.  Proving a negative can be difficult, of course.  The law\nrecognizes that the burden of proving a negative can be satisfied by proof which renders probable\nthe existence of the negative fact.  (See Majestic Sec. Corp. v. Commissioner, 120 F.2d 12, 14 (8th\nCir. 1941) (\u201cA negative proposition may appropriately be established by proof of an affirmative\nopposite.\u201d); CareFirst of Md., Inc. v. First Care, P.C., 434 F.3d 263, 269 (4th Cir. 2006) (\u201cthe\nabsence of any evidence of actual confusion over a substantial period of time - here, approximately\nnine years - creates a strong inference that there is no likelihood of confusion.\u201d); Aetna Casualty &\nSurety Co. v. General Electric Co., 758 F.2d 319, 325 (8th Cir. 1985) (citing 22 C. J. Evidence \u00a7 15\n(1940) \u201cWhenever the establishment of an affirmative case requires proof of a material negative\nallegation, the party who makes such allegation has the burden of proving it, especially where the\nmost appropriate mode of proof is by establishing the affirmative opposite of the allegation.\u201d);\nLeonard v. St. Joseph Lead Co., 75 F.2d 390, 397 (8th Cir. 1935) (\u201cA negative in its very nature\nusually is susceptible of no more than approximate proof, and generally is sufficiently proved by\nproving some affirmative fact or state of facts inconsistent with the affirmative of the proposition\nto be negatived.\u201d); Ake v. GMC, 942 F. Supp. 869, 874 (D.N.Y. 1996) (\u201cA lack of evidence of prior\naccidents is never conclusive proof that the defendant exercised due care, but it is a factor that the\nfact-finder could consider.\u201d).) \nNormally in cases presented under Guideline B, numerous documents are introduced as\nevidence of the nature of any security risk posed by the foreign country.  Typically these discuss in\nsome detail any history of a friendly or hostile relationship between the foreign power and the United\nStates, the foreign country\u2019s human rights practices, and any reports of the history of intelligence-\ngathering activities by the foreign power. These documents constitute evidence of an \u201caffirmative\nopposite\u201d tending to establish the negative proposition.  For example, evidence that the U.S. and a\nforeign government have security alliances is some evidence suggesting the foreign government\nwould not act adversely to U.S. security interests  Similarly, where a document reflects the extent\nof any intelligence collecting activity, but does not include any indication that the foreign power has\nengaged in the kind of exploitive behavior which forms the basis for concern in Mitigating Condition\n1, the absence of evidence is some proof, though not conclusive, that such exploitive behavior has\nnot occurred.\nOf course, the important point is that this \u201cabsence of evidence\u201d is competent evidence upon\nwhich an applicant may rely in attempting to prove his or her case, and which an administrative\njudge is required to consider when weighing all the evidence.  The simple fact that an administrative\njudge does so does not constitute an improper \u201cshifting of the burden of proof.\u201d \nA close examination of the cases where the Appeal Board has found \u201cburden shifting\u201d is\nrevealing.  For example, in ISCR Case No. 02-22461 (App. Bd. January 5, 2005), the administrative\n\n21\njudge carefully set out the proper burdens of proof for the government and the applicant, and found\nthe government had presented evidence raising security concerns under the applicable guideline.  The\nadministrative judge then specifically reiterated that, \u201cOnce the government meets its burden of\nproving controverted facts, the burden shifts to an applicant . . . .\u201d  (Id. at 6.)  While discussing all\nthe evidence bearing on the relationship between the foreign country in question and the United\nStates, the administrative judge noted, \u201cfurther, there is no indication that Taiwan has ever attempted\nto exploit any resident of Taiwan for the purpose of compromising a security clearance holder within\nthe United States.\u201d  (Id. at 7.)  The administrative judge issued a favorable clearance decision and\nthe government appealed.  The Appeal Board concluded the administrative judge improperly shifted\nthe burden of proof to the government to disprove the existence of a mitigating condition.  (ISCR\nCase No. 02-22461 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005).)  However, a review of the original opinion\nreveals the administrative judge did not improperly shift the burden of proof; rather, he was\ncommenting on the state of all the evidence, and making a permissible comment on what the\nevidence did or did not show.  (Compare ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5-6) (App. Bd. January 27,\n2005) with ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005) (finding \u201cburden\nshifting\u201d); and ISCR Case No. 03-16848 at 3-5 (January 24, 2005) with ISCR Case No. 03-16848\nat 8 (App. Bd. August 30, 2005) (finding burden shifting).)  The Appeal Board\u2019s rulings on this issue\neffectively deny applicants the opportunity to present favorable evidence under Mitigating Condition\n1, thereby denying the due process afforded under Executive Order 10865 and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6.\nRebuttable Presumption\nThe Appeal Board has also made it more difficult for an applicant to obtain a favorable\ndecision in cases brought under Guideline B through its application of a \u201crebuttable presumption,\u201d\nlong recognized by the courts as a \u201ctroublesome evidentiary device.\u201d  (Ulster County Court v. Allen,\n442 U.S. 140, 157 (1979).)  The Appeal Board created \u201ca rebuttable presumption that an applicant\nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, his spouse\u2019s immediate family members.\u201d  (ISCR Case No.\n01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).)  As applied to these administrative cases, the Appeal\nBoard\u2019s presumption is not rationally based and exceeds the scope of its authority.\nA rebuttable presumption requires the fact-finder to find the presumed element unless the\napplicant persuades him or her that such a finding is unwarranted.  (Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S.\n307, 314 (1985).)  Under Rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (which serve as a guide for\nadministrative hearings under the Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.19) \u201ca presumption imposes on the party against\nwhom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption.\u201d\nIn other words, a presumption places upon the opposing party the burden of establishing the non-\nexistence of the presumed fact.\nIn order for a presumption to meet basic requirements of due process, there must be a\n\u201crational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed.\u201d  (Tot v. United States,\n319 U.S. 463, 467 (1943).)  A presumption is \u201c\u2018irrational\u2019 or \u2018arbitrary,\u2019 and hence, unconstitutional,\nunless it can be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow\nfrom the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u201d  (Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 36 (1969);\nBarnes v. United States, 412 U.S. 837, 841-43 (1973).)\n  \n\n22\nIt is important to keep in mind that the presumption only arises in the narrow circumstance\nwhere an Applicant, a U.S. citizen, is married and his or her spouse has immediate family members\nwho are citizens or residents of a foreign country.  In such cases, the immediate family members\nnormally reside in a foreign country; often the applicant has never met them or has only met them\na few times, and cannot speak their language.  Comparing the proved fact (the applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s\nimmediate family members are citizens or residents of a foreign country) and the presumed fact (the\napplicant has close ties of affection or obligation to them), it is readily apparent they do not coincide.\nConsidering the normal circumstances for cases under Guideline B, there is no rational basis for the\npresumption that an applicant has ties of affection or obligation to his spouse\u2019s immediate family\nmembers. \nThe presumption fashioned by the Appeal Board also has the effect of re-writing and\nexpanding the scope of Disqualifying Condition 1 under Guideline B.  As currently written, the\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1, lists as a condition that could raise a security concern: \u201cAn immediate\nfamily member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a\ncitizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.\u201d  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1 of the Directive\ndefines immediate family members\u201d as \u201cspouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters.\u201d\nAs written, Disqualifying Condition 1 is raised\u2013essentially automatically\u2013where there is evidence\nthat immediate family members are citizens or residents of a foreign country.  For Disqualifying\nCondition 1 to apply to anyone else, it must be also shown that the applicant has close ties of\naffection or obligation to them.  By applying the presumption, the Appeal Board has effectively re-\nwritten Disqualifying Condition 1, expanding it to automatically apply where an applicant\u2019s spouse\nhas immediate family members who are foreign citizens or residents.  Of course, had the drafters of\nthe Directive intended that application, they could have written DC 1 that way.  However, the\ndrafters did not do so, and it is beyond the authority of the Appeal Board to expand the scope of DC\n1 through a rebuttable presumption.\nResult\nComparing the balanced provisions of the Executive Order and the Directive against the\nabsolute standards applied by the Appeal Board in Guideline B cases, it appears the Appeal Board\u2019s\nrulings are not consistent with the Directive.  Where the Appeal Board\u2019s rulings are inconsistent with\nthe policy and terms of the Directive, it creates enormous difficulties for administrative judges, who\nare torn between their responsibility to properly apply the Directive and the requirement in remand\ncases to correct the errors identified by the Appeal Board.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.35.)  In such\ncircumstances, the recommended practice is to follow the decision of the higher body, leaving to\nsuperior courts the prerogative of overruling incorrect decisions.  (Rodriguez de Quijas v.\nShearson/American Express Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989).)  Of course, federal courts have the\nauthority to compel agencies to follow their own regulations.  (Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers\nUnion, Local 473 v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 892-93 (1960); Hill v. Department of the Air Force, 844\nF.2d 1407, 1412 (10th Cir. 1988).)  Until a higher court intervenes, we are bound by the Appeal\nBoard\u2019s holdings.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n23\nI considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. \nParagraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if\n\u201can immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or\nobligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.\u201d  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1\ndefines \u201cimmediate family members\u201d to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers,\nand sisters.  None of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members fall within the terms of this paragraph.\nHis wife\u2019s parents are citizens of the P.R.C., although they reside permanently in the U.S.  They live\nwith Applicant and his family, care for his young child, and rely on him for support.  I conclude\nApplicant has close ties of affection or obligation for his wife\u2019s parents.  These circumstances are\nsufficient to raise possible security concerns.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife also has a sister who is a citizen and resident of the P.R.C.  As discussed\nabove, the Appeal Board holds that there is a rebuttable presumption that Applicant has close ties\nof affection or obligation to his wife\u2019s sister.  It appears Applicant has little or no contact with his\nsister-in-law, and what relationship exists is not favorable.  Considering all the evidence, I find\nApplicant has rebutted any presumption that he has close ties of affection or obligation to his wife\u2019s\nsister in the P.R.C.\nUnder \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.2 of the Directive, it may be disqualifying where an applicant is\n\u201c[s]haring living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the\npotential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists.\u201d  Applicant shares his living quarters with\nhis wife\u2019s parents, who are citizens of the P.R.C.  They have several ties to the P.R.C., including\ntheir citizenship and a daughter, son-in-law, and grandchild living in China.  I find the evidence\nraises this potential security concern.\nThe Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.7, provides that it may be a security concern where there are\n\u201c[i]ndications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are acting to increase the\nvulnerability of the individual to possible future exploitation, coercion or pressure.\u201d  Department\nCounsel argued this concern was raised because Applicant\u2019s second wife was a citizen of the P.R.C.\nwhen she met and married Applicant, and because a Chinese travel agency provided tours of China\nto Applicant.  However, the available evidence is insufficient to establish that Applicant\u2019s second\nwife or the Chinese travel agent were representatives of the P.R.C. or that they were motivated, in\nwhole or in part, by a desire to increase Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to future exploitation, coercion,\nor pressure.  I note Applicant was a travel agent at that time\u2013he had not assumed his present\nposition\u2013and thus had no access to classified material.  I find the evidence insufficient to raise this\npotentially disqualifying condition. \nUnder the Directive, potentially disqualifying conditions may be mitigated through the\napplication the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept and specific mitigating conditions.  When the Government\nproduces evidence raising potentially disqualifying conditions, an Applicant has the burden to\nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the conditions.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)\nThe government never has the burden of disproving a mitigating condition.  (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).)\n\n24\nParagraph E2.A2.1.3.1 of the Directive provides that it is potentially mitigating where the\n\u201cassociate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person\ninvolved and the United States.\u201d  As noted above, applicants must establish: (1) that the individuals\nin question are not \u201cagents of a foreign power,\u201d and (2) that they are not in a position to be exploited\nby a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved\nand the United States.  (ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004).)  \nNone of Applicant\u2019s in-laws meet the definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d under 50\nU.S.C. \u00a7 438(6) and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b).  Similarly, none of them would be considered as an \u201cagent\nof a foreign power\u201d under the more expansive definition adopted by the Appeal Board.  The\navailable evidence indicates his wife\u2019s parents are both retired from non-governmental employment\nand her sister works in the private sector.\nThe second prong of the test is whether the relatives in question are \u201cin a position to be\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.)  The federal statute, 50\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a), defines \u201cforeign power\u201d to include: a foreign government; a faction of a foreign\nnation; an entity openly acknowledged by a foreign government to be controlled by that foreign\ngovernment; a group engaged in international terrorism; a foreign-based political organization; or\nan entity directed and controlled by a foreign government. \nTo determine whether Applicant was \u201cin a position to be exploited by a foreign power,\u201d I\nwould ordinarily weigh Applicant\u2019s connection to his wife\u2019s family against his strong ties to the\nUnited States.  I would note that Applicant\u2019s wife and child are citizens and residents of the United\nStates, and therefore entitled to the liberties and protection afforded U.S. citizens.  His wife\u2019s\nparents, while citizens of the P.R.C., reside permanently in the U.S. and thus are removed from the\nphysical control of foreign powers in the P.R.C.  Moreover, they have no connection to or\ndependence upon a foreign power in the P.R.C.  His wife\u2019s sister presents a somewhat greater\nvulnerability; although she has no connection to or dependence upon a foreign power, she is still\nunder the physical control of the P.R.C.  Applicant\u2019s record of successfully holding a security\nclearance for many years, and his career of distinguished service to the U.S. Navy, make it extremely\nunlikely that he would be vulnerable to improper influence through his wife\u2019s relatives.  \nHowever, as discussed above, in order to apply the second prong of Mitigating Condition 1,\nthe Appeal Board requires that applicants affirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone\nwould attempt to exploit a foreign relative in the future.  Also, the Appeal Board prohibits any\nconsideration of evidence that is not dispositive of the issue.  Finally, the Appeal Board finds it\nirrelevant to this issue whether an applicant is likely to be improperly influenced by a foreign relative\nor associate.  Applying that standard, Mitigating Condition 1 does not apply.\nUnder the Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3, it may be mitigating where \u201c[c]ontact and\ncorrespondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s contact with his wife\u2019s\nsister has been isolated and infrequent, but he has regular and frequent contact with his wife\u2019s\nparents.  This potentially mitigating condition applies only in part.\nThe \u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept.\n\n25\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\u2013not the potentially disqualifying or mitigating conditions\u2013is the\nheart of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance.  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.3.)\nIndeed, the Appeal Board has repeatedly held that an administrative judge may find in favor of an\napplicant where no specific mitigating conditions apply.  (ISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nAug. 10, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-09389 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2004).)\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or her relatives or associates\nin a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  As noted above, \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1,\nE2.2.2, and E2.2.3 of the Directive specifically require each administrative judge to consider all the\nfacts and circumstances, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, when evaluating each individual\ncase.  To ignore such evidence would establish a virtual per se rule against granting clearances to any\nperson with ties to persons in a foreign country, contrary to the clear terms of the Directive.\n\u201cAlthough the position of an applicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and may preclude the\nfavorable application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances (including the realistic potential for exploitation) may still warrant a\nfavorable application of the relevant general factors.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr.\n17, 2006) (footnotes omitted); accord ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2006).)\nOne of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors which must be considered is \u201cthe potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.)  In that regard, an important factor for\nconsideration is the character of any foreign power in question, including the government and entities\ncontrolled by the government, within the relevant foreign country.  This factor is not determinative;\nit is merely one of many factors which must be considered.  Of course, nothing in Guideline B\nsuggests it is limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.  (See ISCR Case No. 00-0317\nat 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2002).)  The Appeal\nBoard repeatedly warns against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations\nand \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6\n(App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002)).  It is well understood that \u201c[t]he United States has a compelling interest\nin protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that\nis not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has\ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19,\n2004).)  Distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with extreme\ncaution.  Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly.  Moreover,\neven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view\nas important to their vital interests or national security.  Finally, friendly nations have engaged in\nespionage against the United States, especially in economic, scientific, military, and technical fields.\n(ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).)\nNevertheless, the relationship between a foreign government and the U.S. may be relevant in\ndetermining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely to attempt to exploit a\nresident or citizen to against the U.S. through the applicant.  The nature of the foreign government\nmight also relate to the question of whether the foreign government or an entity it controls would risk\njeopardizing its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in order\nto force a U.S. citizen to betray this country.  A friendly relationship is not determinative, but it may\nmake it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives\nor associates in that foreign country.\n\n26\nThe government of the People\u2019s Republic of China is controlled by the Communist Party.\nThe State Department reports it has a poor record of protecting human rights.  The P.R.C. has a\nhistory of poor relations with the U.S.  These factors are not determinative, but suggest it is more\nlikely that China would attempt to exploit its residents or citizens to act adversely to the interests of\nthe United States in the future. \nIt is also helpful to consider Applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 vulnerability to exploitation by foreign\npowers in the P.R.C.  Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law reside permanently in the U.S. and are thus out of\nthe physical control of the P.R.C.  They are not attached to or economically dependent upon the\nP.R.C. government.  His sister-in-law lives in China and is therefore more vulnerable to the foreign\npowers there.\nMost importantly, it is necessary to consider Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation through\nhis relatives.  Applicant is a mature individual with an impressive history of service to this country.\nHe is a U.S. citizen by birth.  He provided many years of exceptional service to the U.S. Navy, as\nan enlisted member and an officer, and successfully held a high-level security clearance during his\nmilitary career.  Applicant has strong ties to the United States.  Because of Applicant\u2019s deep and\nlong-standing relationships and loyalties in the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the United States.  I find the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress does not constitute a security risk.  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.) \nI considered carefully the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved\nin favor of the national security.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any potential security concerns\narising from Applicant\u2019s family ties to the P.R.C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nMy conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 27, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nApplicant states that, contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding that he engaged in overspending, he\ndoes not overspend.  Applicant also took issue with the Judge\u2019s statement that he only recently\ninitiated a good faith effort to resolve his debts.  Applicant asserts that he has been trying to resolve\nhis debts in good faith for the past 20 plus years.  Applicant also mentions his 35-year service to the\ncountry both in the military and civilian life, and states that he would never hurt his government in\nany way.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant and his wife engaged in overspending during the period\nof his financial difficulties and her finding that Applicant is just beginning the process of financial\nrehabilitation are reasonably supported by the record evidence.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  A review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision reveals that the Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct.  She considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person\nfactors.  The Judge  reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfs.

On November 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on a date uncertain and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on February 17, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 23,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for March 12, 2009.  At the hearing the Government\npresented twenty-three exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 23.  The\nApplicant presented no exhibits, but testified on his own behalf.  The record remained\nopen until close of business on March 26, 2009, to allow the Applicant to submit\nadditional documentation.  The Applicant submitted fourteen Post-Hearing Exhibits,\nreferred to as 1 through 14.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 19,\n\n2\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 55 years old, and has a high school\ndiploma and three years of college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nAerospace Planner and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits to all of the allegations set forth in the SOR, except\nallegations 1(g), 1(q), 1(r), 1(s), 1(t),1(u) and 1(v) under this guideline.  Credit Reports of\nthe Applicant dated April 16, 2002; March 8, 2004; June 1, 2005; February 18, 2006;\nFebruary 27, 2006; August 13, 2007; February 4, 2008; May 23, 2008; October 27,\n2008; and February 13, 2009, collectively reflect each of the delinquent debts set forth\nin the SOR.  These reports indicate that the Applicant is currently indebted to a number\nof creditors totaling in excess of $45,000.00.  (See Government Exhibits 8, 9, 11, 13,\n14, 16, 17, 18, 21, and 22).  \nThe Applicant explained that during the 80's, he filed exempt on his tax\nwithholding due to child support obligations for three children that he had to pay.  This in\nturn caused him difficulty with paying his regular monthly expenses and bills.  It was\nalso about this time that he stopped filing income tax returns and stopped paying his\nincome taxes because he believed that he did not have to, pursuant to the beliefs of a\nradical movement at the time, and because he simply did not have the money.  In 1992,\nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) garnished his wages for tax years 1982 through\n1986 and for tax year 1991.        \nApplicant testified that on October 24, 1986, upon the advice of his attorney, he\nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy with the intentions of being relieved of his tax burden.\n(Tr. pp. 54 -55).  The Applicant\u2019s wife at the time had also charged up credit card debt\nthat the Applicant could not afford to pay.  He listed approximately $68,593.62 in debts.\nFor some unknown reason, the bankruptcy was dismissed on December 11, 1986.  He\nfiled for Chapter 13 again, on January 6, 1987.  The bankruptcy was dismissed on April\n24, 1992.  \n\n3\nDue to his continuing financial problems brought on by overspending, child\nsupport obligations, and requests for tax payments required by the IRS and the state,\nthe Applicant was advised by his attorney to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  On or about\nNovember 18, 1992, the Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He listed his liabilities\nof $73,005.00 and total assets of $95,247.00.  The Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged\non March 24, 1993. \nAs a result of his failure to file income tax returns on a timely basis, and for his\nfailure to pay his income taxes, the Applicant became excessively indebted to the\nInternal Revenue Service and the state franchise tax board.  Evidence in the record\nshows that the Applicant is indebted to the IRS for federal back taxes owed for tax year\n1992, in the amount of $10,257.73; for tax year 1993, in the amount of $4,860.97; for\ntax year 1994, in the amount of $5,723.36; for tax year 1995, in the amount of\n$6,354.91; for tax year 1996, in the amount of $6,176.65, and for tax year 1997 in the\namount of $6,816.44.  (See Government Exhibits 6 and 20).  He is also indebted to a\nstate franchise tax board for back taxes owed for tax year 1997, in the amount of\n$1,313.69; for tax year 1998, in the amount of $7,788.01; for tax year 1999, in the\namount of $1,755.62; and for tax year 2002, in the amount of $1,273.75.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 19).      \nApplicant currently has one federal tax lien filed against him for approximately\n$31,472.00.  (See Government Exhibits 6, 12, 17, 18, 20 and 23).  He also has three\nstate tax liens that have been filed against him that total almost $15,000.00.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 13, 15, 18, 19).\nApplicant is also indebted to a number of other creditors.  (See Government\nExhibit 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, and 22).  Applicant denies a debt owed to a\nhospital in the amount of $134.00.  He denies a debt to a bank in the amount of\n$128.00.  He denies a credit card debt in the amount of $1,197.00.  He denies a debt to\na telephone company in the amount of $162.00, and contends that he has paid the\ndebt, but provides no proof of payment.  He contends that a debt owed for delinquent\nchild support in the amount of $530.00 is a mistake. Also, a debt owed to a cable\ncompany in the amount of $276.00 is a mistake because he turned in the cable box.  A\ndebt owed to a creditor in the amount of $86.00 remains outstanding because the\ncreditor would not allow him to pay it without a drivers license.  Regarding a debt owed\nto a creditor in the amount of $68.00, the Applicant has no knowledge of the creditor.\nAlthough the Applicant denies these debts, they remain listed on his latest credit report.\n(See Government Exhibit 22).  \nThe Applicant testified that his wages have been garnished by the IRS and the\nstate franchise tax board for many years.  Except for an eight month period where he\nwas on disability, he has had an ongoing wage garnishment.  He states that in February\n2008, he entered into an agreement with both tax authorities to have his wages\ngarnished for back tax repayment to the IRS in the amount of $150.00 weekly, and to\nthe state franchise tax board in the amount of $60.00 weekly.  (Tr. p. 72).  These\ngarnishments are  currently in effect.    \nIn addition, the Applicant hired a tax accountant to assist him in filing his income\ntax returns.  He  has filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 1992,\n\n4\n1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997.  A letter from the Applicant\u2019s tax preparer indicates\nthat he with regard to tax year 2002 and 2006, the Applicant expects to receive a\nrefund.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 4, 13 and 14).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations that raise questions abut his ability to protect classified\ninformation.   \nThe Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns on a timely basis for tax\nyears 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007.  Applicant also failed to file his\nstate income tax returns on a timely basis for tax years 1990, 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996,\n1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.  Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal\nand state income tax returns on a timely basis demonstrates an unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations and raises serious questions about his judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness.   \nOn September 18, 1998, Applicant filed his 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and\n1997 federal and state income tax returns.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 6, 7,\n8, 9, 10 and 11).  His income tax returns for the other tax years in question have not yet\nbeen filed.    \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16(e).  personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that\ncountry or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other\ngroup. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n\n6\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and personal conduct which demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and he failed to file his tax\nreturns on a timely basis (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment,\nunreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope\nand nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his\nsecurity clearance eligibility.\nBeginning in the 80's, the Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax\nreturns on a timely basis and failed to pay his federal and state taxes.  As a result, he\nhas been playing catch up for many years.  To this date, he remains excessively\n\n7\nindebted to both the IRS and the state tax authorities.  He has filed some of his income\ntax returns, but not all of them.  Both tax authorities are presently garnishing his wages.\nHe does not know what he currently owes, but it is clear that both tax liens remain in\neffect.  In addition, the Applicant has a number of other delinquent debts that have not\nbeen cleared from his credit report.  Applicant needs a better handle on his financial\naffairs in order to properly resolve them.  He is obviously just beginning the process of\nfinancial rehabilitation, but more time is needed to work on a budget and payment plan\nand show a systematic method of payment over time.\n      \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  His financial problems\nremain current and they are not isolated.  He has only recently initiated a good faith\neffort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.  At the present time\nhis financial affairs are still not entirely being addressed.  More time and progress is\nnecessary to determine that he is sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to be granted\naccess to classified information.  \nUnder Guideline E, (Personal Conduct), Disqualifying Condition 16(e) personal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2)\nwhile in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for\nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group\napplies.  Applicant failure to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes in a timely\nfashion is indicative of poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness.  None of the\nmitigating conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.     \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.t.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.w.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.x.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.y.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.z.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.aa.: Against the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Finding no error, we affirm.2\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant joined the U.S. Air Force\nin 1978, taking early retirement in 1997.  On three separate occasions, twice in the 1980s and once\nin 1990, Applicant copied software belonging to the U.S. Air Force or to civilian universities for use\non his personal computer.  He did so in connection with the discharge of his official duties.\nAdditionally, in the mid 1990s, he used a government computer to browse the internet after working\nhours.  This computer was not classified and was set aside especially for such personal use and\nmembers checking their home e-mail accounts, etc.  In 1996, he scanned a photograph of himself\nonto this computer and forwarded it to his home.  He then forwarded this picture to an internet\nagency specializing in assisting customers in meeting women from Eastern Bloc countries.  Upon\nsubmitting his retirement application, Applicant used this government computer to seek post-military\nemployment.  \nApplicant set up a private post office box in order to receive correspondence from the Eastern\nBloc women he contacted through the internet service.  He received letters from 10 women.  The\nJudge found that Applicant never discussed classified information with them.  In 1997, when his\nprivate post office box closed, letters were forwarded to his work address, where they were\ndiscovered by a secretary and presented to Applicant.  Applicant claimed that someone must have\nbeen joking with him.  He took the letters to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and\nfiled a complaint.  He subsequently made a second false report, presenting the OSI with a second set\nof letters.  This was shortly before Applicant retired.  Applicant did not tell his wife of his activities\nwith the internet dating service until 2006.  \nIn 2003, Applicant had two security violations while working for his civilian employer.  He\nhad submitted reports to customers using an unclassified e-mail system.  The reports contained\n\n3\n\u201csubtle violations\u201d that were not caught by Applicant\u2019s employer or by the program manager.\nApplicant received a letter of reprimand and was given additional training as well as additional staff.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nThe findings which Applicant challenges are either permissible characterizations by the Judge\nor harmless error, in that they would not be reasonably likely to change the outcome of the case.\nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings do not reflect\na reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  We note Applicant\u2019s challenge to\nthe Judge\u2019s handling of testimony by a psychologist concerning the results of testing performed on\nApplicant.  The Judge had permitted the psychologist to testify over Department Counsel objection.\nIn his decision, the Judge summarized this testimony: \u201c[The psychologist stated that] Applicant\u2019s\nconduct [in filing the false complaints with the OSI] can be explained away because his ethnic\nbackground is such that the fear of embarrassment and humiliation are some of the worst things that\ncan happen to Applicant.\u201d  The Judge went on to state, \u201cI reject the psychologist\u2019s testimony as\nirrelevant and pure speculation.\u201d  Decision at 9.  Applicant interprets this statement as meaning that\nthe Judge extended the testimony no consideration at all.  After reading the record, we conclude that\nthe Judge did, in fact, consider the testimony but that he found it not to be persuasive.  Considering\nthe record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s challenged findings of security concern are sustainable.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert den 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\n\nMany of these same facts were also alleged under Guidelines M and K, which the Judge resolved favorably\n3\nto Applicant.  We find no inconsistency in the Judge having done so.  While Applicant may have met his burden of\npersuasion as to alleged misuse of technology or to security violations, the Judge could still reasonably believe that the\ntotality of Applicant\u2019s conduct reflected negatively upon his judgement and reliability.  See Directive  \u00b6  D2.A5.1.1.  \n4\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).  \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s findings in light of the record as a whole.  We conclude that\nhe articulated a rational connection between those findings and his ultimate decision.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  While the Judge focused most of his attention on\nApplicant\u2019s  two false reports to the OSI and the fact that Applicant neglected for nine years to\ninform his wife of his activities with the internet dating service, the Judge\u2019s formal findings under\nGuideline E encompassed the whole of Applicant\u2019s conduct as reflected in his findings of fact.3\nUnder the circumstances, we conclude that his adverse decision is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor\ncontrary to law.\n   \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jea E.

They were implemented by the Department of Defense\nin a memo dated August 30, 2006, for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The SOR in\nApplicant\u2019s case was issued on May 14, 2004.  The Judge correctly based his decision on the\nAdjudicative Guidelines in effect at that time.  See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov.\n14, 2006).\nApplicant is essentially challenging the implementation of the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines by the Under Secretary of Defense.  The Board\u2019s jurisdiction and authority are limited\nto reviewing security clearance decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges.  See Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 through E3.1.35.  Nothing in the Directive gives the Board the jurisdiction or authority\nto pass judgment on the wisdom or desirability of guidance provided by the Under Secretary of\nDefense.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0457 at 5 (App. Bd.  Jan. 3, 2001).  \n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s denial of a security clearance under the Directive\nconflicts with Applicant\u2019s constitutional rights to freely exercise his religion and educate his\n\n3\nchildren, and his statutory rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  The Board has no\njurisdiction or authority to adjudicate Applicant\u2019s claim in this regard.\nThe Supreme Court has acknowledged the inherently discretionary nature of security\nclearance decisions and concluded \u201c[i]t should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security\nclearance.\u201d  Department of Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 527-28 (1988).  Given the inherently\ndiscretionary nature of security clearance decisions, no applicant has any reasonable expectation of\nhaving a vested interest in or right to a security clearance.  Moreover, the federal courts have\nrepeatedly held there is no property right or interest in a security clearance or a job requiring a\nsecurity clearance.  See Jones v. Navy, 978 F.2d, 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992); Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF.2d 1399, 1403-04 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991); Doe v. Cheney, 885 F.2d 898,\nth\n909 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Chesna v. U.S. Department of Defense, 850 F. Supp. 110, 118-19 (D. Conn.\n1994); Williams v. Reilly, 743 F. Supp. 168, 172 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).\nThe Board\u2019s jurisdiction and authority is limited to reviewing security clearance adjudications\nmade under the Directive. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 through E3.1.35.  The Board does not have the\njurisdiction or authority to entertain challenges to the wisdom or legality of provisions of the\nDirective.  See DISCR Case No. 90-0208 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 1991)(no Board authority to hold\nthat the Directive is unconstitutional); DISCR Case No. 99-0457 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2001) citing\nThunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 215 (1994)(adjudication of constitutionality of\nstatutes is beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies).  Nor does the Board have jurisdiction\nor authority to adjudicate an applicant\u2019s rights under provisions of the U.S. Code.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-33144 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sept. 7, 2004).  The Board has reviewed the record in this case and\nconcludes that the Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order\n10865 and the Directive.\n(3) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law because it is inconsistent with the decisions of other Hearing Office Judges in\nostensibly similar cases.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe decisions in other DOHA Hearing Office cases cited by Applicant on appeal do not\ndemonstrate error by the Judge in this case.  A decision by a Hearing Office Judge is not legally\nbinding precedent on that Judge\u2019s colleagues in other cases, even if Applicant establishes close\nfactual similarities between the cited cases and the instant case.  ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 31, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-23776 at 3 (App. Bd. June 13, 2006).  Likewise, the cited\ncases are not legally binding precedent on the Board, and the Board need not reconcile the Judge\u2019s\ndecision below with those decisions.  ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006); ISCR\nCase No. 01-22606 at 3-5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2003).  To the extent those decisions offer a persuasive\nalternative analysis for the facts and circumstances of the present case that could lead to a different\nresult, they are of no moment.  As noted above, the Board does not review cases de novo, and it may\nnot substitute its judgment for that of the Judge.\n(4) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to law because Applicant was granted a clearance in 1996 in order to execute a government\nproject, and held that clearance without any problems until the project was completed in 1999.\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\n\n4\nThe Board has previously held that there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing a security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n00318 at 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004); ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2005).  Prior\nsecurity clearance adjudications and the granting of clearances for the Applicant have no bearing on\nthe legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision here. See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 03-\n04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).   The government is not estopped from making an adverse\nclearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n24506 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 11, 2003).  In that regard, the government has the right to reconsider the\nsecurity significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct or\ncircumstances having negative security significance.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 91-0775 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 25, 1992); ISCR Case No. 02-17609 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).\n(5) Applicant argues that the evidence he provided in the proceeding below was sufficient\nto require the Judge to conclude, as a matter of law, that he had rebutted, mitigated or extenuated the\nsecurity concerns raised by the Guideline B allegations.  In support of that argument, Applicant\ncontends that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s sons are vulnerable to coercion is unsupported\nby the record.  He also contends that under the whole-person concept, the Judge gave insufficient\nweight to Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, including the fact that: Applicant was a U.S. citizen by\nbirth, with long-standing personal, family and financial ties to the U.S.; he had renounced his Israeli\ncitizenship and given up his Israeli passport; he had previously held a clearance without any\nproblems; and his family members in Israel held U.S. citizenship.  Applicant\u2019s arguments in this\nregard do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them\napplies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound\ndiscretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App.\nBd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  Applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a\nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nApplicant had the burden of presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate facts\nthat the Department Counsel proved or that Applicant admitted regarding his foreign family and\npersonal ties and financial interest.  Applicant also had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to\nobtaining a favorable security clearance decision.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge had to evaluate\nthe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide whether Applicant had met his burden of persuasion under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The fact that Applicant\u2019s explanations and his mitigating evidence did not lead\nthe Judge to the decision desired by Applicant does not establish error.  The presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\n\n5\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of\nApplicant under Guidelines C and E, and articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any\nmitigating conditions or factors with respect to the Guideline B allegations.  He reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  \nThe Judge's decision shows that he did more than merely verbalize an adherence to the\n\"whole-person\" concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-24428 at 5 (App. Bd. May 3, 2006).  The\ndecision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number of variables to reach a commonsense\ndetermination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  In some instances, as noted earlier, this process led to favorable\nfindings for the Applicant.  However, the Judge also articulated a reasonable concern that Applicant's\ncircumstances could potentially make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure\u2014an\nimportant consideration in the \"whole-person\" analysis.  Directive E2.2.1.8.  That concern is based\non a combination of close family and personal ties and a substantial financial interest in Israel,\nconsidered in the context of the overall political/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United\nStates.  Applicant offers a rational alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  However, that\nalternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation\narbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13,\n2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational explanation for his unfavorable security clearance\ndetermination under disqualifying and mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there\nis sufficient record evidence to support that determination\u2014given the standard that required the\nJudge to err on the side of national security.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \n\n6\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. Our scope of review under this standard is narrow, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge. We review matters of law de novo. The Board does not review a Judge's decision against a standard of perfection. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 95-0319 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 18, 1996); DISCR Case No. 91-0109 at 7 (App. Bd. July 1, 1993). The Board reviews a decision as a whole, rather than focusing on isolated sentences or passages in it, to discern what the Judge meant. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-1874 at 4 (App. Bd. July 30, 1993). There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless he specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997); DISCR Case No. 93-1186 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 1995). Moreover, the Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 1992). Close cases should be resolved in the favor of national security, rather than in the favor of the Applicant.

The Defense Office of Hearings\n1\nand Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required\nby Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on\nJanuary 19, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The President\nissued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them\neffective September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG\nare to be used in all cases when the SOR is issued on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR\nwas issued prior to September 1, 2006, this case proceeds under the former guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 20, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on February 16, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 8, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.  The government offered thirteen exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-13.  Applicant offered\n1 exhibit, marked as Exhibit A.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  I kept the record open\nuntil March 30, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional documents.  He filed four\ndocuments that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C, D, and E, and admitted without objection.\nThe government filed one exhibit marked as Exhibit 14, and was admitted without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 19, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the all of the allegations contained in the SOR except subparagraphs\n1.dd., and 2.a. through 2.g.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,\nI make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 55-year-old computer scientist employed by a federal contractor.   He was\n2\ndivorced in 1998, and has two children.   He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, and has completed about 75%\n3\nof the work toward\u2019s a master\u2019s degree.

He held a security clearance while in the service, attended\n5\ncollege, and received another security clearance in 1978, when he was employed by a government\ncontractor.  He has held a clearance since that time.6\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started around 1996-1997, hitting bottom as a result of his\nsecond divorce in 1998.  He was required to pay $1550 per month for child support and alimony.\nAt the time of the divorce, he and his wife were in the process of an extensive home remodeling,\nadding a substantial addition to the house, and incurring a considerable amount of debt.  The family\nincome at that time was based on the salaries of both Applicant and his then wife.  The divorce\ncreated a substantial hardship for him because of the alimony and support, attorney\u2019s fees, and the\ndebt incurred in the extensive home renovations.  He was required to pay all credit card debt.  The\nalimony and child support payments were taken from his wages by court-ordered withholding, and\namounted to 40% of his monthly take-home pay.  A large portion of the home construction debts was\nfinanced through the use of credit cards.  Although he eliminated contributions to his 401(k)\nretirement plan, he was unable to pay many of his creditors.   Nine judgments and six garnishments\n7\nensued.8\nAttorney fees continued, because he repeatedly had to go back into court in order to enforce\nthe exercise of his child visitation privileges.  Finally, in the fall of 2004, he sought professional help\nfrom a credit counseling service and ultimately decided to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.9\nApplicant had 21 delinquent debts totaling $98,727, and an income tax lien in the amount\nof $10,849.  He claimed that he had paid the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.s., 1.t., and 1.z.,\nwhich totaled $16,775.  Those debts listed in subparagraphs 1.w., 1.y., and 1.aa., are to be paid when\nhe refinances his home.  The debts listed in subparagraphs 1.bb. and 1.cc., appear to be duplicates\nof the debts listed in subparagraphs 1.u. and 1.y., respectively.  Subtracting these figure from the total\nyields an amount of $73,518, representing the debts listed in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.r., 1.u.,\n1.v., 1.bb., and 1.cc., which were listed in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition filed October 14, 2004.\nThere are nine judgments totaling $35,400, eight of which are listed in the bankruptcy petition.\nApplicant paid the ninth judgment which was for $5,000.

He stated:\nFrom what I remember, you know, because during that period, I think if you look at\nthat application, I think I answered some garnishments, because it was several\nquestions about garnishments.  I think I answered some of those and some of them\nI did not answer.  I tried to answer the questions.  I know that I remember answering\nsome.  Some I did not.  Some I didn\u2019t have information on, and you know, that was\nstill part of that difficult period that I was having, because I did attempt to answer\nsome of those questions.  Maybe I didn\u2019t answer all of them, and I mean, you know,\njust to spend a whole lot of time on my finances.  But it was nothing due to trying to\nhide them, because I did answer some of those questions.  I think at the time I was\njust--wanted to complete the process, and to keep it less painful as possible.  I\u2019m just\ntrying to remember my actions during that period of time.  It wasn\u2019t anything that I\nwas trying to not disclose about my finances, because I did attempt to answer some\nof those questions.

Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

But I did attempt to answer some of those questions, you know.22\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\n23\n\n \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n24\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\n8\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.24\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (A history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an\n(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in paying his debts since\nat least 1999.\nVarious conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The\nDirective sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (The\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation).  Applicant and his ex-wife began having marital problems in 1996 and 1997, leading\nto divorce in 1998.  Applicant was required to pay the credit card debts, much of which had been\nused on their home expansion.  With a sizable alimony and child support payment, the loss of his\nwife\u2019s income contribution, and the costs associated with his home expansion project, Applicant was\n\n9\nin financial exigency.  He could not pay his creditors, resulting in nine judgments against him and\nsix corresponding garnishments to enforce those judgments.  He also had a federal income tax lien.\nAfter failing on his own to resolve his indebtedness, he turned to financial counseling for help.\nSlowly, but steadily, he is extracting himself from financial insolvency.  The tax lien was paid in\n2003.  He filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy, wage earner petition, and has paid about 50% of his\nrequired payments.  He is now able to petition the bankruptcy court to allow him to refinance his\nhome.  Because of its size and improvements, Applicant is confident that there is sufficient equity\nto pay off all outstanding debts.  Divorce is usually an unseen event.  For that reason, I find the\nmitigating condition applies.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) applies.  Applicant\nsought financial counseling, and there is substantial evidence that it has been of benefit to him.\nAlthough he has not totally resolved his debts, he has made significant efforts to get his finances\nunder control.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve bad debts) is applicable.  Since filing for bankruptcy in October 2004,\nApplicant has made consistent progress in reducing his indebtedness.  He is not required to pay\n100%, to show a good-faith effort to repay creditors.  He has established a credible effort at reducing\nhis indebtedness, and it was made in good-faith.  I conclude Guideline F for Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, unreliability, lack of candor, or dishonesty could\nindicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nThe government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) is\nthe standard.  The operative word is \u201cdeliberate.\u201d  The 1971, arrest, and his 1970 Article 15 in the\nAir Force are over 35 years old.  He did not remember the Article 15.  Due to the age of the\nincidents, I find his omission to be due to a faulty memory, and not done with any deliberate\nintention to mislead the government.  The 1989 questionnaire also  deals with the 1970 and 1971\nincidents and I again do not believe his omissions were deliberate.  I conclude SOR subparagraphs\n2.a. through 2.d. for Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s answers on the 1999 and 2004 SF 86 applications are more problematic.\nApplicant knew he had delinquent debts, judgments, and garnishments beginning in 1999, but failed\nto report them.  His explanations were rambling.  He provided no rational reasons why he did not\nanswer the questions on these applications completely.  No mitigating conditions apply.  I conclude\nGuideline E, SOR subparagraphs 2.e., 2.f., and 2.g. against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n25\nId.\n26\nId.\n27\n10\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n25\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n26\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   Applicant has made good-\n27\nfaith efforts at resolving his indebtedness.\nApplicant falsified numerous security clearance questionnaires/applications.  This is\nproblematic because candor with the government about a person\u2019s embarrassing information is the\ncrux of a trustworthiness and security determination.  If a person discloses their personal adverse\ninformation, then he or she is more likely to be trustworthy with confidential or classified\ninformation.  Applicant has held a security clearance for nearly 30 years  His attempt to explain his\nfalse answers on the 1999 and 2004 security clearance applications was evasive, and he never\nprovided a clear explanation.  For this reason, the totality of the record raises reasonable and\npersistent doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its\ninterests and secrets.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn July 23, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Christopher Graham granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in\nconcluding that the Government had not met its burden of production; whether certain of the Judge\u2019s\nfactual findings were not based on substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge erred in concluding that the Government had not\nmet its burden of production as set forth in the Directive.  This burden is to present \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.\u201d   In this case, the\n1\nSOR alleged, inter alia, that Applicant\u2019s employment with the government contractor had been\nterminated because Applicant made inappropriate use of government equipment, visited\ninappropriate web sites, downloaded unauthorized software onto his computer.  The SOR also\nalleged that Applicant falsified a sworn statement to a Defense Security Service (DSS) investigator\nby denying the facts alleged above.  Applicant denied each allegation of the SOR.  \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated because he had informed\nthe government agency about deficiencies in software used by his employer.  He stated that\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s testimony to the contrary had not been credible and that the Government\u2019s\ncase rested upon the supervisor\u2019s testimony.  Department Counsel argues that the Government\n\n\u201cThe only thing I got was a complaint from the Government saying that [Applicant] came in to them and was\n2\ntalking about the problems that they knew existed with the software but he was doing it in a bad-mouthing way.\u201d  Tr. at\n59.  Compare the supervisor\u2019s testimony that Applicant\u2019s termination came about three or four weeks from the date of\nthis counseling with Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the Judge\u2019s finding, that it occurred only \u201ca couple of days later.\u201d Tr.\n4\npresented other evidence than the supervisor\u2019s testimony to establish its case and that the evidence\ntaken as a whole met the Government\u2019s burden of production. \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  In addition to the testimony of the supervisor,\nthe Government presented documentary evidence.  Government Exhibit (GE) 2, a memorandum\nfrom the Facility Security Officer at Applicant\u2019s employer to the DSS, stated that Applicant\u2019s\nemployment was \u201cinvoluntarily terminated\u201d due to \u201cinappropriate use of government equipment;\nvisiting inappropriate websites, the loading of unauthorized software on government equipment to\ninclude deliberately not following instructions and performance issues.\u201d  GE 3 is a memo to\nApplicant from his employer, advising that \u201c[a]fter repeated counseling concerning numerous\nperformance issues, we feel that it is in the best interest of the company to terminate your\nemployment . . .\u201d  The memo goes on to explain various aspects of the termination process, such as\nreceipt of final pay, continuation of medical care, etc.  Applicant signed the memo, reflecting his\nhaving read and understood it.  GE 4 is a memo for record (MFR) prepared by a company official\ndescribing a meeting between herself,  another official, and Applicant.  The memo, prepared four\ndays after the meeting, states in pertinent part, \u201c[Applicant] reported to [company headquarters] on\nMonday morning and [official ] and I met with him. [Official] stated that he was being terminated\nfor inappropriate use of government equipment (visiting inappropriate websites and loading\nunauthorized software on government equipment) and performance issues.\u201d\nThese three documents, taken together, set forth the facts alleged by the Government as\nunderlying Applicant\u2019s loss of employment.  They are consistent with one another.  They are also\nconsistent with the supervisor\u2019s testimony.  The Judge described these documents as \u201cafter the fact\nexhibits\u201d and stated that only GE 3 was ever shown to Applicant.  However, he did not explain why\nhe did not find them to be credible, although they are mutually consistent, were prepared close to the\nevents, and corroborate the supervisor\u2019s testimony.  Therefore, to the extent that the Judge\u2019s analysis\nof the Government\u2019s burden of production rested upon his view that the Government had relied\nsolely upon the testimony of the supervisor, and that the case consisted merely of the supervisor\u2019s\nword against the Applicant\u2019s, his analysis is error.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge made unsustainable findings of fact regarding\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor.  Specifically, Department Counsel challenges the following: (1) \u201cShe [the\nsupervisor] also testified that she counseled Applicant for telling the government manager the truth\nabout the software\u201d and (2) \u201cThe fact that the company program manager was upset with Applicant\nfor telling the government the truth belies [sic] the fact that they expected him to cover up a defective\nproduct, and when he refused, retaliated.\u201d  The Board has examined the record and concludes that\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  The supervisor testified that there were indeed problems\nwith the software they were using and that officials both of the contractor as well as the government\nagency were aware of these problems.  However, she also testified emphatically that she never told\nApplicant to lie about the software, only having counseled him, at the Government\u2019s request, to\nrefrain from raising issues of which the Government was already aware in an apparently offensive\nor disruptive manner.   She testified in great detail as to the reasons underlying Applicant\u2019s having\n2\n\nat 92; Decision at 5.  Compare also the supervisor\u2019s account of the facts underlying the software counseling with GE 6,\na memorandum from Applicant\u2019s commanding officer when Applicant served on active duty with the Army, stating that\nApplicant had been removed from a promotion list for, inter alia, insubordination  \nQ: What happened regarding the second incident [of placing hacker software on his computer]?  A: . . . I again\n3\nhad somebody verify that software was loaded on the system.  At that point in time, I brought it to the government\u2019s\nattention and was told immediately . . . to remove him from the contract and get him off the site.\u201d  Tr. at 36-37.  \nISCR Case No. 91-0028 at 7 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 1992).  \n4\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03472 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 6 (App. Bd.\n5\nApr. 3, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005).  \nDecision at 7-8.  \n6\nTr. at 131.\n7\nSee ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 11 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001) (\u201cWhen the record contains evidence that, on its\n8\nface, clearly detracts from the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions, then the Judge\u2019s decision must contain sufficient\ndiscussion, analysis or explanation to enable the parties and the Board to discern a rational basis for the findings the\nJudge made and the conclusions the Judge reached.\u201d)\n  \n5\nbeen fired, the principal one being his repeatedly having placed hacker software on his computer.3\nAs stated above, her testimony is generally consistent with GE 2, 3, and 4.  It was not seriously\ndiscredited by cross-examination.  The two challenged statements, therefore, do not reflect a\nreasonable or plausible interpretation of the supervisor\u2019s testimony.4\nFinally, Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law, particularly that the Judge substituted a credibility determination for\nrecord evidence.    Applicant\u2019s version of events was that he had complained to the government\n5\nabout problems with his employer\u2019s software, despite his employer\u2019s insistence that he lie about it,\nand that his refusal to lie underlay his leaving the contractor\u2019s employ.  At the end of his decision,\nthe Judge stated that he had observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and that \u201cApplicant\u2019s explanations are\nboth consistent and sincere and have the solid resonance of truth.\u201d   An examination of the record,\n6\nhowever, reveals apparent inconsistent statements by Applicant which the Judge\u2019s decision does not\naddress.  For example, in GE 5, a statement by Applicant to a DSS investigator, Applicant stated \u201cI\nfelt my leaving [contractor] was by mutual agreement versus a termination . . .I was unaware that I\nwas terminated . . .\u201d  On the other hand, during the hearing he stated that he knew that he was indeed\nterminated and attributes the apparent contradiction to a problems of semantics: \u201c[m]aybe I misused\nthe English language.  I\u2019m not an English major.\u201d   However, the statements in GE 5 are clear and\n7\nunambiguous and appear to contradict his testimony and impugn his credibility.  The Judge\u2019s\ndecision does not attempt to resolve this apparent inconsistency or otherwise explain why it should\nbe considered minimal when compared with the record as a whole.  \nNeither did the Judge subject Applicant\u2019s version of events to a reasoned analysis of other\ncontrary record evidence.   Applicant insisted that he did not commit the acts alleged in the SOR,\n8\nthat he believed he had left the contractor by mutual agreement, and that the contractor never told\nhim he was terminated for the reasons set forth in the SOR.  However, as stated above, GE 3 is a\nmemo with a signed acknowledgment by Applicant that his employment had been terminated due\n\n6\nto \u201cnumerous performance issues,\u201d and GE 4 is a MFR that explicitly states that management\ninformed Applicant of the specific reasons for the termination, those alleged in the SOR.  Beyond\ndescribing these documents as \u201cafter the fact\u201d and noting that GE 2 and 4 were not shown to\nApplicant, the Judge did not explain why he discounted their credibility as descriptions of the events\nleading up to Applicant\u2019s loss of employment.  \nInsofar as the Judge obviously concluded that Applicant was fired due to having advised the\nGovernment about his employer\u2019s defective software, he apparently concluded that the documents\nin question were prepared after the events they describe in order to mask the employer\u2019s true\nintentions.  However, other than Applicant\u2019s statement and testimony, there is no evidence to support\nthis view.  Applicant\u2019s one witness was a fellow parishioner from his church who spoke about\nApplicant\u2019s good character and dedication to the U.S.  The Board also notes that, despite the fact that\nhis employer told him in GE 3 that he was being terminated for cause, Applicant testified that he did\nnot challenge that decision, a failure somewhat at odds with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\nwas fired in retaliation for truth-telling.  See  Tr. at 143.  We conclude, therefore, that, in holding for\nApplicant, the Judge relied too heavily on his interpretation of Applicant\u2019s demeanor and did not\nevaluate Applicant\u2019s credibility in light of the record as a whole.  In view of the discussion above,\nwe conclude that the record will not sustain the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 19, 2005, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline M\n(Information Technology Systems), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  The\nPresident issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD\nimplemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive\n5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1,\n2006.  Because the SOR was dated before September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case\nproceed under the former guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 18, 2005, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on March 29, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on April 26, 2007.  I convened a hearing on May 17, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security clearance.\nThe government offered seven exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-7.  I then placed a telephone call to\nthe government\u2019s witness.  Applicant offered fifteen exhibits, marked as Exhibits A-O.  All exhibits\nwere admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 30, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all allegations in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old information security engineer employed by a federal government\ncontractor.   He is married and has two children.   He has an associate college degree.   He served\n2\n3\n4\nin the United States Army for 20 years retiring with the rank of staff sergeant (E-6).  He worked with\ncomputers, computer programming, and working with soldiers\u2019 security clearance applications.  He\n\nId. at 67-70; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D through K.\n5\nId. at 74.\n6\nId. at 19. \n7\nId. at 20-23.\n8\nId. at 24-27.\n9\nId. at 27-33.\n10\n4\nearned Army commendation medals, Army achievement medals, Army Good Conduct medals\namong numerous awards and citations.   He has held a security clearance since 1982.\n5\n6\nApplicant worked for a computer software company for about five months in 2002.  The\ngovernment\u2019s case was built upon the testimony of the company\u2019s program manager.  She testified\nby telephonic  conference.  The program manager, spent 22 years in the United States Army, military\nintelligence branch, retiring as a sergeant major in 1998.7\nThe contract that she managed was computer and network security at a military installation.\nShe acted as the interface between the government and the contractor.  Applicant\u2019s duties were to\nreview the security logs of  network monitoring equipment.  She stated that some of the rules for\ngovernment computer use was that you could not load onto your computer any software that had not\nbeen approved by the government; you couldn\u2019t visit any unauthorized sites, such as pornographic\nor hacker site; and you were not authorized any personal use on your computer, other than to get e-\nmails.8\nThe witness alleged that Applicant was reading more of people\u2019s e-mails than was necessary\nto determine if there was a security breach.  The system would notify of a potential security violation.\nApplicant would review the e-mail to see if there were any security issues.  If there were none, he\nwas supposed to immediately terminate the connection, back out of it, and not review it anymore.\nShe recalled counseling him because he read an email between a gay person and her mate, which she\nsays he discussed with others in the office.  One of the other office members brought it to her\nattention.  She said Applicant basically agreed, apologized and said he wouldn\u2019t do it again, and\nthere were no more complaints about it.9\nShe alleged that on another day, Applicant was looking at a website that had women scantily\nclothed and that it offended a coworker.  The first time she gave him a verbal warning and a second\ntime was more formal.  She told him what the rules were, that he had signed a statement indicating\nthat he knew the rules when he was hired, and that he was violating the contract with the\ngovernment.  He apologized, said he understood he had done wrong, and wasn\u2019t going to do it\nagain.10\nNext, the witness testified that around September 2002, Applicant had loaded hacker\nsoftware onto the  system that allowed it to track others and access their systems.  Another employee\nwas familiar with this software, saw it on Applicant\u2019s computer, and reported it to the program\nmanager.  Applicant was not authorized to use the software.  She counseled him and had some of\n\nId. at 34-39.\n11\nId. at 40-42. \n12\nId. at 43-47.\n13\nId. at 47-52.\n14\n5\nthe other computer technicians check out his computer.  A week or two later, it occurred a second\ntime.  She brought it to the government\u2019s attention and was told to immediately remove him from\nthe contract and get him off the site.  She told Applicant to log out and shut down his system, and\nthat he needed to gather all his personal items together.  When he asked why, he was told that she\nhad again found hacker software on his system.  He asked to speak to the government representative\nin charge, and she told them that the person had specifically told her he didn\u2019t want to speak to\nApplicant.  He just wanted him gone.11\nShe also testified that one time, she found Applicant playing solitaire on his computer.\nPlaying games on a government computer was prohibited.  However, all games had not been\nremoved from the computers.  She said to her knowledge, he never played cards again.  She did state\nshe had seen other people playing cards, but she apparently did not warn those people.12\nShe also stated she counseled Applicant on his use of the chain of command.  The contractor\nwas having problems with the common intrusion detector director software.  She said the\ngovernment had been made aware of the problems.  She said the government liaison complained to\nher that Applicant had come to him to complain about the system.  She wrote him up and explained\nthat she was the interface between the government and the contractor, and that he should direct\nquestions to her.  There were problems with the system.  It was logging far too many false security\nintrusion alerts.  Genuine security breaches were missed because of the number of false alerts.  There\nwas delay in getting program updates.13\nThe employer did not keep a list of appropriate websites, it did not have a list of banned\nsoftware, she denied instructing Applicant not to advise the government about his candid assessment\nof the performance of the software.  She denied that Applicant was asked directly by the government\nprogram manager about the problems with the software.  She denied telling Applicant that he must\nnot value his job with the company.  She denied that Applicant was asked to leave the company\nalmost immediately after his second discussion with the government manager where he informed\nhim about the continuing deficiencies in the company\u2019s product.14\nApplicant testified his job was to check the alerts that would come up on the console to make\nsure they were either actual true alerts or if they were false positives.  It was his job to protect the\nsystem against attempted intrusions for security violations.  When the company\u2019s software was\ninstalled, it had problems in that thousands of false positive alerts were popping up on the console.\nThe government project manager didn\u2019t understand why it was taking the company so long to fix it.\nOccasionally,  the government program manager would stop by Applicant\u2019s console and want\nto know how the program was working.  Applicant would show him thousands of alerts and told him\nthe problem is too many alerts, that he could not tell which ones were real and which were false.\nApplicant said he could go into each alert to examine it, but it was very time consuming and it would\n\nId. at 86-90.\n15\nId. at 90.\n16\nId. at 92.\n17\nGovernment Exhibit 3 (Termination Letter, dated September 23, 2002) at 1-2. \n18\n6\ntake a lot of man-hours to check each one to verify its authenticity.  He asked Applicant if this was\nnormal and Applicant said \u201cNo.\u201d  After the government manager left, the company program manager\ncame to Applicant\u2019s desk to ask what the government manager wanted.  Applicant told her.  She told\nApplicant that he was not supposed to tell the federal government that anything was wrong with the\ncompany\u2019s product.  Applicant told her that he was asked a question, and it was unethical not to tell\nthem the truth, and the truth was the product was not working like the company had promised.  She\nthen told Applicant that she was the program manager for the company and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell him what\nhe needs to know.  You don\u2019t tell him anything.\u201d   Applicant told her that she was forcing him into\n15\nthe position where he had to lie, and that he would not lie.  She told them to have the government\nprogram manager, see her next time.   A few days later the government program manager returned,\n16\nand asked Applicant how the program was working, and Applicant told him that he could not tell\nhim what was going on with the software.  At that, the government manager got upset and told\nApplicant that he (Applicant) would tell him what\u2019s going on with the software because he paid\nApplicant\u2019s salary.  Being put that way, Applicant told him what was wrong, that the software wasn\u2019t\nreporting correctly, and that too many alerts were popping up on the console.  The company program\nmanager then walked over and this exchange followed:\nI overheard you talking to him.  What did you tell him?  And I said, I told him the\ntruth.  And she said, I told you not to talk to him.  And I said, hey, I can\u2019t lie.  I\nworked for the Army for 20 years.  It\u2019s against my--it\u2019s my--my integrity is on the\nline.  It\u2019s unethical.  I just won\u2019t do it.  And she said, well, obviously you don\u2019t value\nyour position here.  I said, if it means lying, no I don\u2019t.  And I believe it was a couple\ndays later, when I was asked to pack up my things in a box and depart the area.17\nApplicant was aware there was a dispute between the government and the contractor about\nperformance.  The contract was based on performance and if the time table was not met, the contract\ncould be canceled.  Applicant stated that the company did not maintain a list of unauthorized\nsoftware.  Part of his job responsibility was to visit hacker websites.  He stated he did not download\nany unauthorized software.  He also did not intercept e-mails.  What he did intercept was instant\nmessage traffic, which is prohibited by the government.  The company did not maintain a list of\nwebsites that it deemed appropriate or inappropriate for access by employees.  Often when running\ndown a hacking website, other prohibited sites would pop up on the screens.  He denied intentionally\nvisiting obscene or inappropriate websites; trying to introduce a virus into the computer system; and\nillegal entry of the company technologies.\nApplicant received a termination letter dated September 23, 2002.  The letter does not state\nthe reasons for his termination.   The next day, a human resources employee with Applicant\u2019s\n18\nemployer wrote herself a memorandum for the record (MFR) stating that Applicant was terminated\nfor inappropriate use of government equipment (visiting inappropriate websites and loading\n\nGovernment Exhibit 4 (Memorandum for the Record, dated September 24, 2002) at 1.\n19\nGovernment Exhibit 2 (Letter to DSS, dated October 18, 2002) at 1.\n20\nGovernment Exhibit 5 (Applicant\u2019s Sworn Statement, dated August 11, 2003) at 1-3.\n21\nGovernment Exhibit 6 (Recommendation of Removal from SFC Promotion List, dated November 8, 1996) at 1-4;\n22\nGovernment Exhibit 7 (NCO Evaluation Report, dated July 15, 1996) at 1-2.\nId. at 103.\n23\nId. at 144-150.\n24\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C (Letters of Recommendation, dated April 27, 2007) at 1.\n25\n7\nunauthorized software on government equipment) and performance issues.   About a month later,\n19\nApplicant\u2019s former facility security officer (FSO) sent a letter to Defense Security Services (DSS)\ninforming DSS that Applicant was terminated for inappropriate use of government equipment,\nvisiting inappropriate websites, the loading of unauthorized software on government equipment, to\ninclude deliberately not following instructions and performance issues.   Applicant denied each of\n20\nthese allegations in a statement to a DSS agent.   The SOR alleged that his statement is false, and\n21\nthereby a criminal act pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\nIn 1996, Applicant was removed from the Army promotion list to sergeant first class (SFC).\nThis occurred because he had demanded that a female soldier participate in physical training (PT)\nby running with the company, but she had a physical profile which allowed her to run at her own\npace.  \n22\nApplicant\u2019s father, uncle, and brother are retired Army officers.  His son is in Army training,\nand his daughter is married to a Marine.   His pastor testified about his honesty, character, and\n23\nintegrity.   Two co-workers wrote letters of recommendation, describing Applicant\u2019s\n24\nprofessionalism, trustworthiness, high moral character, and integrity.25\n POLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n26\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n27\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n8\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses\n26\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the\ngovernment.27\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n9\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI conclude that the government failed to establish its case under Guideline E, Guideline M,\nand Guideline J.  Applicant denied the allegations in the SOR.  In a controverted case, the\ngovernment has the burden of establishing its case.  The government\u2019s case rested upon the\ntestimony of the company program manager. It is apparent that the company had a problem with its\nsoftware, and the program did not do what it was designed to do.  When asked if there was a problem\nwith the software by the government manager, Applicant told the truth and stated that the program\nhad problems and was not working properly.  The fact that the company program manager was upset\nwith Applicant for telling the government the truth belies the fact that they expected him to cover\nup a defective product, and when he refused, retaliated.  This finding is reinforced by the fact that\nshe told Applicant that she would tell the government what the government needed to know.  In a\nportion of her testimony, she denied that the government program manager went to Applicant\u2019s desk\nto ask about the software.  She also testified that she counseled Applicant for telling the government\nmanager the truth about the software.  Her explanation was that Applicant sought out the government\nmanager to bad-mouth the software.  We know that Applicant talked to the government manager.\nI believe his version that he was approached by the government, told the truth, and then was fired.\nIn looking at the record evidence, none of the after-the-fact exhibits, the MFR nor the letter\nto DSS show a copy to Applicant.  The only letter that Applicant received mentioned no reasons for\ntermination.  The government produced no MFR detailing counseling sessions to Applicant, no\nillegal software, and no documents stating what his performance issues were.  The government\u2019s\ncase rises or falls on the testimony of Applicant\u2019s supervisor.  After re-reading the transcript, I did\nnot find her testimony to be credible.  My opinion is that Applicant was terminated for telling the\ngovernment that the software it purchased was defective.  \nI had the opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and\ndeportment, appraise the way in which he responded to questions, assess his candor or evasiveness,\nread his statements, listen to his testimony, and watch the interplay between himself and those\naround him.  It is my impression Applicant's explanations are both consistent and sincere, and have\nthe solid resonance of truth.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of explanation,\nsuccessfully refuted the Government's case. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n10\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns arising\nfrom four drug related arrests in 1996, 2000, 2001, and 2002 resulting in convictions as recently as\n\n2\n2006 for which he is on probation until 2009. He failed to report all but two usages of marijuana on\nhis SF 86 dated in 2000 on Questions 22, 24, and 27 even though he had used cocaine from 1982 to\n1999. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn September 19, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn October 26, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe matter was assigned to me on January 6, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 2,\n2007, for a hearing on March 21, 2007, and held that day. The government offered eleven exhibits\ninto evidence. Applicant offered nine which were appended to his answer and seven more at the\nhearing. All were accepted in evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The transcript was\nreceived on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted with explanation all but one of the four SOR allegations concerning\ncriminal conduct. He denied the two allegations concerning personal conduct. After a complete\nreview of the record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his present\nemployer and its predecessor companies as a senior computer operator since 1989. He has held a\nsecurity clearance since that date. He has a record of four arrests relating to drugs during his\nemployment in 1996, 2000, 2001, and 2002. The first offense concerned prowling in a neighborhood\nknown for drug use. He was given a fine and Safe Neighborhood assessment. \nApplicant used marijuana in the 1980's until the mid-1990's. He used cocaine from 1982 to\n1999 at various times and was diagnosed as cocaine dependent in October 2000 (Exh. 7). This\noccurred after his March 2000 arrest and conviction for possession of rock cocaine, a felony. He was\nfined received pre-trial intervention and given one year probation, drug and alcohol education, and\nrequired to perform 50 hours of community service. The probation was terminated in March 2002\nand the charge dismissed. He was evaluated by a licensed clinical social worker in 2006 and found\nnot to require further treatment (Exh. A). \n\n3\nIn June 2001, while serving probation from the 2000 arrest, Applicant was arrested in another\ncounty in the same state for aggravated criminal sexual contact, a felony. He plead guilty to a lesser\ndrug charge in April 2002 and was placed on probation for one year with 100 hours of community\nservice. \nThe last arrest in September 2002, while on probation from the third offense, did not result\nin a conviction until 2006. It related to purchase via the internet of a controlled dangerous substance,\nGBL, from Canada. This substance is known as a \u201cdate rape\u201ddrug but advertised as a performance\nenhancer. He was convicted of conspiracy to acquire an illegal drug since he never possessed it. He\nwas sentenced to three years probation and fined over $1,000 and he remains on probation until June\n2009. \nWhen Applicant submitted his application for security clearance (SF 86) in December 2000\nhe listed two uses of marijuana in 1994 but did not list his cocaine use, or the October 2000 finding\nof cocaine dependence at Question 27 relating to illegal use of drugs. He did not list the cocaine use\nas he was concerned about his job. He did not list the 1996 and March 2000 arrests in his answers\nto Questions 21 and 24, relating to his police record for felony offenses and alcohol/drug offenses\nas he was required to do. The two later arrests and convictions occurred after filing his SF 86. He\ndid not report any of the arrests and convictions to the company security office as he admitted he was\nrequired to do (Tr. 79). Officials and colleagues at his employer do not know of any of his offenses.\nHe had one minor security violation at his company in 2002. It was not alleged in the SOR but was\ndiscussed at the hearing. It is not a factor for consideration in this matter. He does not intend to use\ndrugs in the future and has had no difficulties with the law since the arrest in 2002 that led to the\n2006 conviction. \nApplicant has owned his own home for 14 years. His mother lived with him for three years\nand this caused some stress in his life. She recently moved to her own home. He is single with a high\nschool education but has taken computer courses through his employer. His salary is $40,000 per\nannum. He is well regarded in his company and is knowledgeable about his job helping to train\nothers(Exhs. K-P). He has been involved in a number of charitable and civic activities in his town\n(Exhs. H-J). \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\n\n4\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.

See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) is alleged both as to the four arrests and convictions and as\na violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001 by falsifying answers to Questions 21, 24, and 27 on his SF 86.\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations (AG \u00b6 30).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include allegations or\nadmissions of criminal conduct (AG \u00b6 31 c), the fact that an individual is currently on probation (AG\n\u00b6 31 d), and violation of probation (AG \u00b6 31 e). The allegations could be mitigated if the criminal\nbehavior was not recent (AG \u00b6 32 a), or there is evidence of successful rehabilitation without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\n(AG \u00b6 32 d). Applicant no longer uses cocaine but did so while holding a security clearance and\ndeliberately withheld the information on the SF 86 for fear of jeopardizing his job. Since he is still\non probation for the last arrest and conviction , it is premature to grant a clearance. Two of his\noffenses occurred while he was still on probation from a prior conviction. Proof of changed conduct\nwas offered but in view of the continued probation and the fact that he was not sentenced for the\n2002 offense until 2006, a greater period of time is required to establish mitigation.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his police record at Question 21, his alcohol/drug offenses at\nQuestion 24, and his drug use and diagnosis of cocaine dependence at Question 27 on his SF 86\nraises issues under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could raise questions about\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to properly safeguard classified information\n(AG \u00b6 15). Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\na personnel security application could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. (AG \u00b6 16\na). None of the mitigating factors are applicable in this matter but I find that he was not required to\nlist the diagnosis in response to Question 27 since that question does not require anything but use\nof drugs.  \n\n5\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. While Applicant\nis making progress at resolving his problems of drug use and conduct that resulted in his arrests and\nconvictions, this is insufficient to grant a clearance. His work performance has remained good\ndespite his criminal misconduct but that provides an insufficient basis for granting a clearance. The\nfact that his company is unaware of any of the offenses particularly the fact that he is on probation\nand will remain so until next year makes him vulnerable for exploitation. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, including the whole person of Applicant, I\nconclude he should not be granted a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1.

O\u2019Brien, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nKeith L. Baker, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 2, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\n\n2\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Security Violations), Guideline M\n(Misuse of Information Technology Systems), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On August 23, 2006, after the considering the record, Administrative Judge\nDarlene Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant submitted\na timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s statements that the\nGovernment had established its case as to all allegations in the SOR and that Applicant had a history\nof repeated security violations were based upon substantial record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis of the applicable mitigating conditions was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis failed to consider relevant factors.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact:  Applicant received a Secret level security\nclearance in 1967, which was upgraded to Top Secret in 1985 and to SCI access in 1988.  His\nclearances were suspended during a Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) investigation\nbeginning in August 2002.\nIn 1986 or 1987, Applicant failed to follow proper security procedures when he allowed his\nsecretary to hand-carry a classified NATO document to an adjacent building.  The secretary was not\ncleared for NATO access.  Applicant explained that he was not aware of the sensitivity of NATO\naccess information.  He has had no further incidents involving NATO materials.\nParagraph 1(b) of the SOR, alleged that Applicant knowingly transmitted classified e-mail\nfrom approximately April 2002 to approximately August 2002, instructing his team to sanitize the\ncomputer rather than notify the security officer of the breach.  After considering the record, the Judge\nconcluded that this allegation was not based upon substantial evidence and held in favor of\nApplicant.\nPrior to 2002, Applicant purchased a laptop computer with government funds.  Applicant\npermitted his son to use the computer, stating that he asked his son to set it up.  Applicant made\ncontradictory statements as to whether both he and his son used the computer or his son only.\nOn July 5, 2002, Applicant permitted his son to have unescorted access to a workspace.\nAlthough signed in at the gate as an \u201cescort required\u201d visitor, Applicant\u2019s son sat alone in an office\nadjacent to Applicant\u2019s.  This was in disregard of company policies.  Additionally, Applicant\npermitted his son to have unsupervised access to a government network.  Although he stated that his\nson was to search for software to download onto the computer, the son hacked into the workplace\nserver and downloaded pornography.  Applicant claims that this material was \u201cadult\u201d pornography,\nalthough the Security Officer\u2019s Report (Exhibit 9) states that the NCIS investigation characterized\nit as child pornography.  Applicant\u2019s dial-in account with the company has been deactivated and his\nkey-card access limited to normal working hours.  The son has been barred from the company site.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors and a government program manager attest to Applicant\u2019s good\ncharacter, reliability, trustworthiness, competence, and dedication to national security.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nAlthough the challenged statements occur in the Conclusions section of the Judge\u2019s decision,\nwe will treat them as findings of fact for purposes of this appeal.  See ISCR Case No. 02-20110 at\nn.2 (App. Bd. June 3, 2004) (\u201cThe Board will treat a finding of fact [as such] regardless of where it\nappears in the Judge\u2019s decision\u201d). \nThe Guideline K security concerns contain two allegations, of which the Judge concluded\nthat only one was supported by substantial evidence, the 1987 incident in which Applicant permitted\nhis secretary to have unauthorized access to a NATO document.  The Judge found in favor of\nApplicant on the other.  Nevertheless, she stated in her Conclusions section that the Government had\n\u201cestablished its case as to all allegations in the SOR. . .\u201d Decision at 7.  This clearly is an error.\nHowever, the Board does not read individual sentences in isolation.  The Judge analyzed Applicant\u2019s\ncase only in light of those matters which she found to have  been supported by substantial evidence.\nThere is no reason to believe that she based her decision to any extent on the 2002 security incident\nconcerning which she ruled in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nRegarding the second challenged statement, that Applicant has a \u201chistory of repeated security\nviolations,\u201d it is true that, under Guideline K, the Judge found only one incident to have been\nestablished.  Therefore, to the extent that the word \u201chistory\u201d implies more than one event, it does not\nproperly characterize the Judge\u2019s findings under that Guideline.  However, given the fact that the\nchallenged phrase occurs at the beginning of the Judge\u2019s Conclusions section, prior to her specific\ndiscussion of Guideline K, we conclude that she intended the phrase to refer to the totality of the\nsecurity concerns which she found the Government to have established and which form the basis of\nher adverse clearance decision.  We conclude, therefore, that even if these two challenged\nobservations had not been included in the Judge\u2019s decision, it is not reasonably likely that the\noutcome of the case would be different.  See ISCR Case No. 01-23362 at 2 (App. Bd. June 5, 2006);\nISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug.\n26, 2002).   Accordingly, we conclude that these statements constitute harmless error. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n\n4\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert den 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006). \nApplicant relies on other cases, both from the Hearing Office and the Appeal Board, to build\na claim that his conduct was mitigated because it was not recent.  That claim is not persuasive.  The\nBoard has repeatedly declined to adopt a hard and fast definition of recency.  Neither do we find\npersuasive Applicant\u2019s claim that his son\u2019s conduct should be considered mitigated because\nApplicant did not know what his son intended to do when given access to a government computer\nsystem.  Indeed, we have examined the Judge\u2019s treatment of the possible mitigating conditions in\nlight of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s findings provide a rational basis for concluding that\nApplicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to the application of mitigating conditions.\nFurthermore, we conclude that her whole person analysis complies with the requirements of\nDirective  \u00b6  E2.2.1, in that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching her\ndecision.  See ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  In light of the foregoing, we\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.  \n\n5\n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

Those favorable findings\n1\nare not at issue on appeal.\n2\nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On August 14,\n2006, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse finding with\nrespect to SOR paragraph 1.c is supported by substantial evidence; whether the Judge erred by\nconcluding that the security concerns raised under Guidelines E and D had not been mitigated.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse finding with respect SOR paragraph 1.c is not\nsupported by substantial evidence, because Applicant\u2019s company had never provided him with any\ndocumentary evidence that he had falsified his time cards.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s\nargument persuasive.    \nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).   The Board does not review a case de novo.  Considering the record evidence as a whole,\nthe Judge\u2019s material finding with respect to SOR paragraph 1.c reflects a plausible interpretation of\nthe record evidence and is supported by substantial evidence.  It is therefore sustainable.\n \n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge should have concluded his disqualifying conduct under\nGuidelines E and D was extenuated or mitigated because the sexual behavior at issue occurred over\n21 years ago and is therefore not recent.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe passage of time since an applicant last engaged in conduct is a relevant factor that a\nJudge should take into account when evaluating the record evidence.  However, Applicant overstates\nthe significance of the passage of time since his last incident of sexual misconduct. Given the\nseriousness of the conduct, the Judge could reasonably have concluded that the time that had elapsed\nwas not significant.  Moreover, the Board need not decide whether that passage of time would be\n\n3\nsignificant or decisive in this case because the Judge's decision is not based solely on Applicant's\nsexual misconduct.  Rather, the Judge's decision is also predicated on her findings that Applicant is\nvulnerable to influence or coercion because of that past conduct, and that Applicant had been\nterminated from his employment because of time card fraud in August 2002.  The Judge's findings\non this aspect of the case are unaffected by the passage of time since Applicant engaged in the sexual\nmisconduct in question.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-26685 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 22, 2004).  Even\ndated conduct can be the source of an applicant's current vulnerability to coercion or influence. See\nISCR Case No. 02-32254 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004).  And the passage of time since\nApplicant's acts of sexual misconduct do not extenuate or mitigate his later acts of falsification.  See\nISCR Case No. 02-33091 at 3 (App. Bd. July 6, 2004).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions. The\nJudge reasonably explained why the evidence presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome\nthe government\u2019s security concerns.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before her, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and D is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

In April 2004, Applicant married a Russian national, whose\nparents and relatives are resident citizens of Russia. In July 2006, Applicant and his wife separated,\nand in October 2006, Applicant formally filed for divorce. The underlying basis for foreign influence\nconcerns no longer exists. Clearance is granted.\n\n  Government Exhibit (GE) 2, (Electronic Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application.)\n1\n  O n August 30, 20 06, the U nder Secretary of D efense (Intelligence) published a memorandum\n2\ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative G uidelines to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the D irective and D epartment of Defense (D oD ) R egulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram  (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SO R was issued on or after\nSeptem ber 1, 2006. Applicant\u2019s case is resolved und er the revised Adjudicative G uidelines.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 2, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nFebruary 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer submitted and signed by Applicant\u2019s attorney on March 9, 2007, Applicant\nresponded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing. On May 2, 2007,\nthe case was assigned to me. On June 4, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case\nfor hearing on August 2, 2007. The hearing was convened as scheduled. I held the record open to\nafford Applicant the opportunity to submit additional materials, and Applicant did submit additional\nmaterial. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough review of the\nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old staff engineer - systems (2) who has worked for a government\ncontractor employer since December 1998. He has completed approximately three years of college,\nand continues to pursue his degree on a part-time basis. He estimates he has \u201cabout a year left\u201d\nbefore graduating and is majoring in management. Applicant has continuously held a security\nclearance for 15 years. He was initially granted a secret security clearance in January 1992, which\nwas later upgraded to a top secret clearance. He holds a top secret clearance. \nApplicant currently resides in Germany and estimates he spends approximately 90% of time\non the road. In April 2004, Applicant married a Russian national he met while he was working in\nChina. His wife\u2019s parents, grandmothers, aunt, uncle and cousins are resident citizens of Russia. In\nconjunction with meeting and marrying his wife, Applicant traveled to Russia a number of times in\n\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole\n3\nperson concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should\nbe considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of \u201cthe nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n4\nthe years 2002 to 2005. These facts raised foreign influence concerns, which formed the basis of\nDOHA issuing Applicant an SOR in February 2007.\nIn July 2006, Applicant and his wife separated. In October 2006, Applicant\u2019s attorney filed\nfor divorce. In July 2007, Applicant signed a separation agreement, and his divorce attorney\nestimates his divorce will be final in October 2007. Applicant has not communicated with his wife\nsince October 2006 and it is his understanding she lives with a friend in the U.S. He has had no\ncommunication whatsoever with his in-laws since January 2006, which was the last time he visited\nRussia. He does not speak Russian nor do his in-laws speak English and he was only able to\ncommunicate with them when his wife served as a translator.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take\ninto account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each AG applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.3\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is the\napplicable relevant AG.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n4\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness\nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \n\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761, at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n5\nthan a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199, at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, supra n.8, at 528, 531.\n6\n  See Id.; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it is\n5\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution\n6\nof any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor\nof protecting national security.7\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \\\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government\u2019s concern is that foreign contacts and\ninterests may be a security concern. If the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG \u00b6 6.\nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this\ncase, including:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group,\nor country by providing that information;\n\n  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n8\n2001).\n6\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law,\ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an\napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for\nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  \n8\nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially disqualifying\nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.\nThe underlying basis forming a foreign influence concern no longer exists inasmuch as\nApplicant has been legally separated since July 2006, has had no contact with his wife since October\n2006, filed for divorce in October 2006, signed his separation agreement in July 2007, and his final\ndivorce decree is pending which will most likely be granted in October 2007. I view the recent\ndevelopment in Applicant\u2019s personal life sufficient to alleviate any foreign influence concerns and\nconsider Applicant constructively divorced.\nThere being no disqualifying conditions, there is no need to apply or discuss mitigating\nconditions under this security concern.\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, Applicant established it is unlikely he will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of his spouse\u2019s family and the interests\nof the United States. His contact with his spouse and in-laws is non-existent. Applicant met his\nburden of showing there is little to no likelihood that his relationship with his spouse or her family\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable AGs. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s answers to the\nSOR, his testimony, and favorable evidence he submitted at his hearing. I also considered that there\nis no evidence that he has ever mishandled or caused the compromise of classified information.\nConsidering all available information, and the whole person concept, I find Applicant has mitigated\nthe foreign influence security concern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by\nDirective Section E3.1.25 are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.d\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n7\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nRobert J. Tuider\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Therefore, any such error would be at most\nharmless.  See ISCR Case No. 05-08459 at 2, n. 1 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2006).  Applicant has not met\nhis burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s conduct\nof security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nsustainable.\n(2) Applicant also contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose information about his prior criminal conduct in response to three\ndifferent questions.  Likewise, he also contends that he did not falsify a signed, sworn statement to\na government investigator by failing to disclose that same conduct.  In support of this contention, he\nargues that the omission of the information was due to a faulty memory, a misunderstanding of the\nquestions, and his unfamiliarity with the security clearance process.  He also argues that he\nsubsequently provided the correct information.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s contentions\npersuasive.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\nThe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification were not necessarily overcome by\nApplicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJan. 22, 2004).  \n(3) Finally, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised by his conduct had not been mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that\nthe prior criminal incidents which he failed to disclose are not recent and not likely to recur, and that\ntheir adverse implications are outweighed by the favorable evidence presented by the Applicant.  As\na result, Applicant requests that the Board \u201ctake another look at [his] case.\u201d  The Board does not find\nthese arguments persuasive.\n\n3\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  The Judge reasonably explained why the\nevidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).\nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuidelines E and J is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nThomas R. Anderson III, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 31, 2005 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline\n\n2\nE (Personal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  The SOR was amended on July 7, 2005 to add\nallegations under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July\n12, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s denial of Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a continuance of his case was an abuse of discretion resulting in denial of due process\nand whether the Judge\u2019s overall negative security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.  The Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision. \nApplicant argues on appeal that the Judge erred in not granting him a continuance at the\nhearing when his attorney was not able to be present due to a prior scheduled trial.  Applicant claims\nhe was then required to proceed with the case without the attorney he had hired and worked with for\nfour months before the hearing.\nApplicant\u2019s original attorney had already requested and received one continuance of the\nNovember 22, 2005 hearing date because of a scheduling conflict.  The hearing was rescheduled for\nFebruary 22, 2006, and Applicant had received more than the minimum of 15 days advance notice\nof that date as provided by the Directive.  Applicant was, in fact, represented by another counsel at\nthe rescheduled hearing, so he did not have to proceed pro se.  The counsel at the rescheduled\nhearing was from the same law firm as Applicant\u2019s original attorney.  \nRulings of DOHA administrative judges regarding the granting of continuances are reviewed\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03683 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 9,\n2002).  Applicant\u2019s appeal brief recites some of the facts relating to the continuance  including the\nfact that Applicant\u2019s chosen attorney could not be present at the hearing.  However, Applicant\u2019s\nappeal brief does not allege how Applicant was harmed by the Judge\u2019s failure to grant the\ncontinuance.  Indeed, the appeal brief does not address the issue of prejudice at all.  There is no\npresumption of error below, and the appealing party has the burden of raising and demonstrating\nfactual or legal error by the Administrative Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0339 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMar. 22, 2001); ISCR Case No. 00-0248 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2001).  Furthermore, the appealing\nparty must set forth its claims of error with specificity.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0519 at 9 (App.\nBd. Feb. 23, 2001).  While Applicant specifically identifies the error he believes the Judge made,\nhe does not explain why the Judge\u2019s ruling was harmful to him.  The Board declines to adopt the\nposition that the mere fact that Applicant was required to proceed to hearing without counsel of his\nchoice is prejudicial as a matter of law.  Therefore, Applicant\u2019s claim of error on this point does not\nestablish error.  Given the record in this case, the Judge acted reasonably within his discretion in\ndenying Applicant\u2019s request for a second continuance.\nApplicant argues that it was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law to deny him his request\nfor a clearance.  Specifically, he argues: (a) the Judge failed to consider and discuss certain evidence;\n(b) the Judge did not adequately consider and give sufficient weight to testimonial and documentary\nevidence submitted by Applicant and instead focused only on negative evidence; and (c) the Judge\ndid not adequately consider various mitigating factors.\n\n3\nApplicant complains that the Judge did not consider evidence concerning his military career\nand the testimony of two witnesses.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge has considered\nall the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n22566 at 3 (App. Bd. June 26, 2003).  Furthermore, the Judge was not required to discuss each and\nevery piece of evidence in his decision and the absence of the items of evidence highlighted by\nApplicant from the decision does not establish that the Judge did not consider them.  Moreover, the\nJudge\u2019s decision contains references to evidence favorable to Applicant that was the subject of some\nof the testimony of the two witnesses in question.  The Board concludes that Applicant has failed\nto demonstrate that the Judge did not consider all the record evidence.\nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal essentially go to the issue of how the\nJudge weighed the record evidence and the applicability of mitigating factors.  The weighing of\nevidence is within a Judge\u2019s discretion, and will not be disturbed by the Board absent a showing by\nApplicant that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law, or not supported by the record as a whole.  The Board sees no basis for disturbing the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence in this case.  The mere fact that a  Judge concludes that favorable evidence\npresented by an applicant is not sufficient to outweigh or overcome the unfavorable evidence does\nnot demonstrate that the Judge ignored or improperly weighed the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 00-0587 at 2 (App. Bd. May 28, 2002).  In this case, the Judge made sustainable findings that\nApplicant had a history of alcohol-related problems including two DUI convictions, a history of\nfailing to file tax returns and pay taxes for several years between 1989 and 2002, and had failed to\ndisclose DUI arrests to alcohol assessment program personnel and on his security clearance\napplication.  In light of these facts, the presence of some mitigating evidence did not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the evidence in mitigation outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed matters in mitigation or reached ultimate conclusions in a\nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08934 at 2\n(App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2006).  \nTo the extent Applicant relies on decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges in other\nDOHA cases, his claim of error is not persuasive.  The decision of one Hearing Office Judge is not\nlegally binding on another Hearing Office Judge in a different case.  Furthermore, the decision of\nany Hearing Office Judge is not legally binding precedent that the Board has to distinguish, follow,\nor explain why it does not choose to follow.  To the contrary, a party citing a Hearing Office decision\nas persuasive authority has the burden of persuading the Board that such a decision should be\nfollowed.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-22606 at 3-5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2003).  The Hearing Office\ndecisions cited by Applicant do not establish the Judge erred in this case.  Nor do those decisions\npersuade the Board that the Judge\u2019s conclusions in the case are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.\nIn his decision, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating\nconditions or whole person factors, and reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Given the\nrecord that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines\nJ, E, and G is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  \n\n4\n          \nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is  AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

An additional allegation of error will be discussed later in\nthe context of one of the falsifications. \n(2) Applicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application\nby failing to disclose that he had previously used marijuana and cocaine.  In support of this\ncontention, he argues that his omissions were the result of a reasonable misreading of the\napplication\u2019s questions. Applicant also argues that the Judge omitted making a finding that in 2005\nan inexperienced investigator never asked him any questions about the 1994 incident in which\nApplicant used cocaine in the presence of subordinates and that the purpose of the interview was\nlimited to financial matters.  Again, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.   The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or\nreject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge had to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the\nrecord evidence as a whole, in reaching his conclusion as to whether Applicant\u2019s omissions were\ndeliberate and intentional.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-11175 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2007).\nApplicant offers a rational alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  However, that\nalternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient, as a matter of law, to render the\nJudge\u2019s interpretation arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101\nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2006).  On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings with respect to the Guideline E\nallegations are sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3\n\n3\n(App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\n(3) Applicant also contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised under Guidelines H and J had not been mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant\nargues that his 30-year history of marijuana and cocaine use\u2014which included  use while holding a\nsecurity clearance\u2014actually amounted to a series of isolated incidents, and that his most recent use\nin 2003 was not recent.  The Board does not find this contention persuasive.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by his disqualifying conduct had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record\nevidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nnature and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant\nwith respect to some of the factual allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the\nevidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).\nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuidelines H and J is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Blank, Jr., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nKenneth R. Rhoad, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. On February 24, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that\nApplicant had intentionally falsified his security clearance application and whether the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.   We affirm the decision of the Judge.\n1\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings that are pertinent to this appeal:  In 2002, Applicant\nfilled out his security clearance application.  Question 36 of the application required him to state\nwhether, within the previous seven years (which dated back to October 10, 1995) he had had a lien\nplaced against him for failure to pay taxes or for other debts.  Applicant answered this question \u201cno.\u201d\nQuestion 38 required him to state whether he had any debts over 180 days delinquent.  Applicant\nstated only that he had a $1600 credit card debt.  Question 39 required Applicant to state whether\nhe was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  Applicant  answered the question \u201cno.\u201d\nIn answering these questions, Applicant did not state that the Internal Revenue Service had\nplaced a lien against him in 1998 for failure to pay taxes in tax years 1991, 1992, and 1996.2\nApplicant explained to the investigator that he believed that he only had to list debts that arose within\nthe seven year window, rather than debts that were ongoing.  In responding to interrogatories,\nApplicant attributed his false answer under question 36 to poor memory.  At the hearing, he initially\nstated that he was unaware of the 1998 tax lien, although he subsequently admitted that his employer\ntold him about it.  Decision at 4.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s finding of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n620-21, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966)). In evaluating the Judge\u2019s finding, we give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nWe have examined the challenged findings of fact in light of the record evidence.  It is clear,\nand Applicant does not now deny, that he answered the questions at issue incorrectly.  The Judge\nnoted Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements as to his awareness of the 1998 tax lien.  He also took into\naccount the gravity and the ongoing nature of Applicant\u2019s problems with the IRS as establishing that\nhe could not reasonably have believed that his answers to question 38 and 39 were truthful.\n\n\u201cThe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n3\nsecurity questionnaire\u2026\u201d  Directive \u00b6  E2.A5.1.2.2.\nDirective  \u00b6  E2.A10.1.1. \n4\n3\nAdditionally, the Judge was in a position to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and assign it appropriate\nweight in evaluating the case.

Accordingly, we\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are supported by substantial record\nevidence. \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

The\nAppeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review under this\nstandard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge. We review matters\nof law de novo.\nThere is no right to a security clearance.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  Once the government raises security concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion shifts to the applicant to establish that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for\nhim to receive a clearance.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.13; E3.1.14; EO 10865 (Feb. 20, 1960)(as\namended).   In the instant case, the Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct, as reflected\nin the record, raised security concerns under Guideline E, specifically Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (PCDC) 2.   He also properly concluded that the evidence establishes\n3\nconcerns under Guideline J.   The Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s explanations for his false answers\n4\ncontain \u201ctoo many inconsistencies,\u201d undermining his credibility and impairing his effort to meet his\nburden of persuasion.  After considering Applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal, we find no error in the\nJudge\u2019s decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge must weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. An applicant's\ndisagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Over ten years later he demonstrated how he reformed himself and\nmade positive changes in behavior.  He now takes all security requirements seriously and persuaded\nhe is willing and able to comply with security rules.  Significantly, all of his managers from that\nearlier period and today have confidence in him.

His managers\nuniformly recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.   Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on October 4, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over\n1\nHandling Protected Information (Guideline K) in paragraph 1 based on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d)\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\n2\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an\nAnswer notarized on October 24, 2006, where he admitted allegations 1.a. and 1.b. and denied\nallegations 1.c. and 1.d. with explanations and attached letters of reference.  He requested a hearing.\nOn December 11, 2006, his counsel entered his appearance.\nDepartment Counsel  on December 8, 2006, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The\n3\nmatter was assigned to another judge on January 4, 2007. Subsequently, a mutually convenient date\nfor hearing was agreed to.  A Notice of Hearing, issued on February 22, 2007, set the matter for\nMarch 9, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  The case was re-assigned to me\non March 5, 2007, because of the unavailability of the previous judge.\nAt the hearing the Government offered eight exhibits  (Exhibits 1-8) which was admitted into\nevidence without objection; also admitted was one document for Administration Notice (AN)\n(Exhibit I).  (TR 13, 21-25) Applicant testified, called five witnesses, and submitted Exhibits A &\nB. As Department Counsel indicated no objection, the documents were admitted into evidence. (TR\n20-24)  The transcript (TR) was received on March19, 2007.\n\n       Applicant was never informed that his Department of Defense top secret clearance had been revoked\n4\nand never received a Statement of Reasons during that period; consequently, he did not appeal.  He did\nappeal the CIA denial of his SCI access and did report their decision to deny him SCI access to his manager\nat the time.  Defense Contractor #1 then made a corporate decision to deny him access to all classified\ninformation  in February 1995 and to terminate him in March 1995.  He did not contest this decision as he\nknew he had done something wrong in mishandling protected information.  (Exhibits 1, 3, 8; TR 198-199;\n203-206)\n3\nAt the close of the testimony, Department counsel moved to amend SOR 1.d. to strike the\nword \u201ctop\u201d and to add \u201cSCI access denied.\u201d  His counsel objected to the use of the word \u201crevoked\u201d\nand argued there was no evidence that his secret clearance was revoked though there was evidence\nthe other agency denied him access to SCI in December 1994.  However, the Applicant\u2019s counsel\ndid not object to the Department Counsel\u2019s amendment to SOR 1.d.  One exhibit did establish this\nallegation, so the motion was granted to amend  1.d. to allege: \u201cYour Secret clearance was revoked\nand your SCI access denied by another Government agency on February 3, 1995, due to that\ninformation alleged in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c., above.\u201d   (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 208-215)\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\n  \nApplicant, 52 years old, is an engineer who returned to work for Defense Contractor #1 in\nState #1 in August  2003 and continues to work as a senior systems engineer.  He completed an\nelectronic Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in September  2003 and is seeking a clearance.\nPreviously, he had worked there from April 1975 to March 1995.  In that period he had a Defense\nDepartment Secret security clearance granted in June 1975; later he was granted a Top Secret\nsecurity clearance in January 1991 and also had been granted access to Sensitive Compartment\ninformation (SCI) in January 1991.  He also had a CIA clearance granted in January 1993. However,\nhe reported on his SF 86 in answer to Question 32: \u201cTo your knowledge have you ever had a\nclearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked. . . ?\u201d he stated, \u201cYes 1995/01/??\nCIA,\u201d   Subsequently, he was unemployed from May to June 1995 after he was  terminated from\n4\nDefense Contractor #1.  He then worked at another private sector company from 1995 to 1996 in\nhourly jobs.  He worked at another company from June 1997 to April 2003 when it was dramatically\ndown-sized; he then was unemployed from May to August 2003.  (Exhibit 1; TR 29; 31-32; 64-69;\n110) \nApplicant\u2019s current work for Defense Contractor #1 involves conceptual missile design.\nHowever, he has not had access to classified information, so there are limits to what he can do.  (TR\n70)\nApplicant married in June 1979 and has two children born in 1979 ad 1985.  His wife also\nhas worked for Defense Contractor #1 for 25 years and has a security clearance.  Applicant studied\nat a college in State #2 in 1995, but received no degree.  (Exhibit 1; TR 28)  He received an electrical\nengineering degree previously in State #3; he initially began work for Defense Contractor #1 as a\ncoop student beginning in 1975.  (TR 29-30)\n\n4\nHandling Protected Information\nPrior to the 1993-94 time frame, Applicant never had any security violations in his twenty\nyears with the company.  (TR 64)  However, in the 1993-94 time period Applicant had multiple job\nresponsibilities with Defense Contractor #1. He was working on three different classified programs\nat the request of management in three separate buildings.  Two projects and buildings were close\ntogether, but the third building was at a more remote location,  two or three miles away from his\nother assignments.  (Answer; Exhibit 4; TR 33-37) \nApplicant\u2019s Admitted Security Violations\n1.a. Applicant took classified documents home at least six times between 1993-1994.\n1.b. Applicant took classified discs home at least three times between 1993-1994.\nIn December 1994 a senior adjudication officer from another Government agency advised\nApplicant that he had undergone the organizations\u2019s security procedures between April and\nNovember 1994 which included three polygraph examinations in June and July 1994.  In those\nexaminations Applicant provided information that raised security concerns.  He had no authorization\nto remove and store classified materials from several documents and reports; but nevertheless, he\ntook classified information home to update reports.  Because he had repeatedly removed classified\nmaterials in an unauthorized manner, knowingly stored classified materials in an unauthorized\nmanner, and did not review material stored in his office to confirm it was all stored appropriately,\nApplicant was \u201cdisapproved\u201d for the SCI access request submitted; the agency also \u201crevoked\u201d his\nexisting clearances.  He was advised he could appeal the decision within 45 days from the date of\nreceipt of the letter to provide corrected or new information or mitigating circumstances.  (Exhibit\n3) Applicant on January 14, 1994, did explain his involvement in three separate classified projects\nin three separate buildings.  He advised that he had shown his program manager the letter of\ndisapproval and his response.  He admitted that \u201ctaking documents home did cross a line that\nshouldn\u2019t have been crossed.\u201d  He admitted he had decided to \u201crecalibrate\u201d his thinking. (Exhibit\n4)\nApplicant admitted he took classified documents marked Secret to his home on at least six\noccasions and classified discs home on at least three occasions without authorization between 1993-\n1994.  He had no authorized storage container in his home.  Also, he admitted he had processed\nclassified discs marked Secret on his home computer and would change documents to a different\nformat at home. He denied the documents were compromised as he transported them with the\nrequired double wrapping. However, he simply stored the classified documents in his briefcase\novernight which does not comply with security regulations.  Applicant had disclosed this practice\nwhere he intermittently took classified items home in polygraph examinations in June and July 1994\nwhich were required for SCI access.  He was advised in December 1994 that he was to be denied SCI\naccess based on his \u201cdeliberate disregard for security practices and procedure.\u201d  He admitted he knew\nthat by his actions he was violating security rules.  He was given an opportunity to respond but his\nonly justification was \u201chis need to get home to take his children out of day care and the\ninconvenience of not having transportation to go back\u201d to a building which had secure facilities.  He\ndid not have a safe in the remote building.  After he advised the company subsequently of the denial\nof his SCI access, the company itself launched its own investigation and took steps to preclude\n\n       The organization is now known as the Defense Security Service (DSS). \n5\n5\nApplicant from having access to classified information.  A February 1995 report submitted by the\ncorporate chief of industrial security to the Defense Investigative Service  (DIS) reported Applicant\u2019s\n5\nsecurity violations in a Memorandum entitled: ISM Paragraph 1-304 - Possible Compromise of\nClassified Information.  (Answer, Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; TR 35-47; 50-52; 56-57; 83; 89-98;\n102; 112)  \nApplicant admitted he \u201ccut corners\u201d and had no excuse. He conceded that if a document was\nmarked \u201cSecret\u201d that it should be treated that way.   (TR 99-100; 103)  His motivation in violating\nthe security rules was \u201creally just to get the job done.\u201d  (TR 63)\nContested Security Violations Concluded Adverse to Applicant \nSOR 1.c.  Applicant stored classified and SCI documents in a non-secure matter\n at his office between 1993-1994.\nApplicant denied both in his Answer and at the hearing that he had improperly stored\nclassified and/or SCI documents in his office as he considered the papers there only \u201ctidbits\u201das  only\nthe completed document would be classified.  However, the Special Adjudication Officer\u2019s report\nincluded Applicant\u2019s admission that \u201cover the years\u201d he had \u201ccollected a substantial number of\nclassified materials and have store them inappropriately.\u201d  Although the polygraph officer requested\nthat Applicant review the material in his office to check for classified documents, Applicant refused\nto do so because he believed such a review  would be too time consuming.  He insisted he never took\nany SCI documents to his office and never had any documents there that were marked classified and\nimproperly stored.  He did admit he had a page from an SCI study that was marked \u201cFor Official Use\nOnly.\u201d (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8; TR 47-50; 81-83; 87-88) A witness confirmed that to his\nknowledge Applicant never removed any SCI documents from a secure facility.  \nApplicant explained that the reason he did not review all the documents in his office in 1993-\n1994 was that he was confident he did not have classified documents unsecured in his office.  Also,\nit would have been a lengthy procedure; and he had only a limited time commitment to that SCI\nproject.(TR 111-112) Applicant was an authorized classifier in that period and determined that the\ninformation in his office was not classified.  However, on cross-examination he admitted that\n\u201ceverything is subject to interpretation.\u201d  (TR 61; 83-84) Today if there was a dispute on\nclassification, he would go to a classification manager to resolve the issue.  (TR 84-87)\n1.d. Applicant\u2019s Secret clearance was revoked and his SCI access denied by another\n Government agency on February 3, 1995, due to that information alleged in\n subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c., above.\nApplicant admitted he was denied SCI access.  The records from that agency also\ndocumented that they revoked his Secret clearance also.  (Exhibit 3) Even though he took some\ncorrective actions, Defense Contractor #1 in March 1995 decided to terminate Applicant\u2019s\nemployment as a result of these deliberate security violations.  Applicant did not contest the\ntermination.  (Exhibits 1, 5; TR 57-61)  Consequently, his DoD clearances were never under\ninvestigation or review as they were administratively terminated.\n\n       Although not formally qualified as an expert, the witness testified on his background in the National\n6\nIndustrial Security Program since its inception in 1985 and his previous involvement in the Defense\nIndustrial Security Program beginning in 1972.  He had twenty years of military and twenty years of civilian\nexperience at the Department of Defense at DSS.  When he retired in 1990, he was the Deputy Director for\nthe Industrial Security Program.  Subsequently, he has been a corporate security manager and consultant.\n(TR 179-188; 189-192) The consultant was paid to provide the training and paid to appear at the hearing.\n(TR 188) His expertise in security matters was established by these credentials.\n       While the briefing materials that the consultant provided did not include any specific information about\n7\nthe problem of removing classified documents to a residence, he did cover that point in his oral discussions\nwith the Applicant.  (Exhibit B; TR 194-195)\n6\nApplicant\u2019s Receptivity to Counseling or Remedial Security Training\nSince that 1993-1994 period of the admitted security violations, Applicant has demonstrated\nsignificant remorse over his earlier misconduct.  He has become alert to the importance of following\nall security rules.  (TR 72-76; 80-81)  \nAlso, at the suggestion of his attorney, Applicant sought additional security training in\nFebruary and March 2007  from a consultant  in the security field who provided security information\n6\nin two PowerPoint sessions with him.  During this one-on-one security training Applicant had the\nopportunity to ask questions via telephone after reviewing slides. Applicant also reexamined with\nthis security professional his violations from 1993-94.  The security consultant will continue to be\navailable to the Applicant for questions and clarifications. (Exhibit B; TR 76-79; 109; 182-185) With\nhis  expertise, the consultant was able to put the security rules in context for Applicant so that he\ncould understand why those rules were created.  (TR 112-113) In addition, Applicant took a security\nclass online at his own initiative at his workplace.  He also recently took a three-hour security class\nthat everyone at the defense contractor facility was required to take.  (TR 108)\nIn March 2007 Applicant explained what was different today about his approach to security.\nHe answered that \u201cbeing fired from a job certainly opens up your eyes.\u201d He admitted his thinking\nat the time of the 1993-1994 incidents was wrong as he was more focused on getting the job done\nthan on complying with the security rules.  He understands more clearly now that he has a lot at\nstake. Also, since key managers went \u201cthrough all the hoops\u201d to bring him back, he would not want\nto disappoint them.  (TR 105-107) \nAlso, although not formally qualified as an expert, I considered the expertise and impressive\ncredentials of the security professional who provided training to Applicant and offered his views on\nApplicant\u2019s current seriousness about security matters.  Consequently, I give substantial weight to\nhis conclusions that Applicant \u201cfully understands the rules now.\u201d  He provided his expert opinion\nthat Applicant is \u201cvery serious and he\u2019s very earnest in complying with those rules to the letter.\u201d  (TR\n186-187) The consultant explained that Applicant realized \u201cin retrospect\u201d that he should have\nfollowed the security rules.  He believes that Applicant now fully understand that he should not have\ntaken classified documents to his home.   (TR 192-194)\n7\nReferences\n\n       Also, the former president was critical of the  company\u2019s decision to terminate Applicant without\n8\nproviding for enough due process.  For example,  there was no procedure to allow anyone to be an advocate\nfor Applicant. \n7\nA chief engineer and company director at Defense Contractor #1 was Applicant\u2019s supervisor\nat the time of the security violations that led to his dismissal. He acknowledged that the pressure of\nsupporting multiple projects stressed Applicant to the point of \u201cunacceptable behavior which led to\nhis dismissal.\u201d   He assessed Applicant as having \u201csound\u201d intentions as his goal was to meet the need\nof the program even though he did not have an option to judge the rules and make his own\nexceptions.  Consequently, he continues to view Applicant as \u201cfundamentally trustworthy.\u201d  Also,\nhe stated that Applicant also possesses talents that are of great value to the national defense.  He\nconcluded that Applicant has learned the lesson on the \u201cuncompromising nature of information\nsecurity rules\u201d and believes that he will in the future abide by them.  He believes Applicant\u2019s\ndismissal \u201cmade permanent the corrective action that will preclude any errant behavior hence forth.\u201d\nConsequently, he recommended the re-instatement of his security clearance.   (Exhibit A)\nA manager, now retired from Defense Contractor #1 but who periodically is called back in\nto help out, testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf and recommended that his security clearance be\nreinstated.  He worked there for ten years as a manager of several small contracts valued at under\n$100,000.  He himself held a Top Secret clearance with SCI access. He knew Applicant in 1990 as\nhe was an engineering specialist who had expertise the manager needed to complete his contracts,\nso he would ask Applicant for his assistance.  He also traveled with Applicant and socialized with\nhim until Applicant left the company in 1995.  He had requested SCI access for Applicant and\nsubsequently learned that access had been denied by that agency.  This manager was not a reporting\nofficial for Applicant\u2019s work, so never evaluated him.  However, he assessed Applicant\u2019s work as\nbeing of a very high quality and viewed him as reliable and dependable.  The manager noted that\nbuilding he worked in had no appropriate area to work on or to store SCI material.  This manager\nbelieves that Applicant never took SCI out of that controlled facility to his home.  However, he was\nadvised of Applicant\u2019s improper removal of other classified material to his home.  Neither the\nagency evaluating Applicant for SCI access nor Defense Contractor #1's management ever asked this\nmanager for his views at the time of security violations in 1995.  Nevertheless, he believes Applicant\nhas now \u201cpaid for that mistake that he made\u201d and \u201cknows that what he did was wrong.\u201d  He does not\nbelieve that Applicant would ever \u201cgo down that road again.\u201d He confirmed that Applicant will\nfollow security rules going forward as he understands the seriousness of what he did.  This manager\nhas had informal contact with Applicant since he has been rehired.  He recommended that\nApplilcant\u2019s security clearance be reinstated based on his knowledge of his character. (TR 115-138)\nThe division president of Defense Contractor #1 in the 1993-1995 period who worked for\nthe company for forty years also testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  He retired in 1996 and is now an\nindependent consultant.  During his tenure, he supervised 8,000 people.  He knew Applicant as he\nwould do studies or analysis on projects within the company.  The president was working on a\nspecial project in 1995 and did not learn of Applicant\u2019s termination until after he had been\ndismissed. He learned that human resources convened a panel to review  the security violations and\n8\nmade a decision to dismiss Applicant.  They did not consider any of the extenuating circumstances\nin the case.   He was shocked as he assessed Applicant as a sincere, honest and conscientious person.\nHe agreed that Applicant had made an error in judgment in taking classified materials home. He\nbelieved Applicant was very dedicated to the success of the programs where he was assigned to\n\n8\nwork.  Later, the president was able to get Applicant\u2019s termination status changed so that he could\nbe re-hired as the president did not believe that \u201cthe punishment\u201d fit the \u201ccrime.\u201d  In his experience\nat the corporation, he observed that normally Applicant\u2019s security violations would have led to a\nsuspension for a period of time, not a termination.  The division president reported that he effected\na change of  status: instead of recording Applicant\u2019s termination as  \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d it\nwas revised to state that Applicant was laid off because he did not have the proper security\nclearances. (TR 139-155)\nA senior manager from the advanced program office who knew Applicant in the 1989 to\n1995  period and was also involved in the decision to rehire him also testified on his behalf.  He has\nhad a DoD Top Secret clearance since 1977.  In the earlier period he and Applicant worked as peers\non classified projects on a daily basis. He assesses Applicant as honest, conscientious and\ntrustworthy so he was surprised to learn of Applicant\u2019s security violations in taking classified\nmaterial home.  He observed him to be generally very conscientious with respect to classified\nmaterial.  He recommended to a manager that Applicant be rehired as he assessed Applicant as a\n\u201cbrilliant individual\u201d who could be a valuable asset even without a security clearance.  Applicant is\ncurrently handling company proprietary information.  He is \u201cdiligent in handling that information.\u201d\n(TR 156-162)  He assesses Applicant as having a heightened awareness today more so than any other\nemployee in the company.  He does not supervise Applicant, but Applicant does work for his\nprograms. He recommended Applicant\u2019s security clearance be reinstated.  (TR 162-166)\nA systems engineering manager who is now Applicant\u2019s supervisor also testified on\nApplicant\u2019s behalf.  He has a Secret clearance and has been his supervisor since October 2005 and\nsees him on a daily basis.  He was been evaluated as very good.  He is diligent and dependable.  He\nassesses Applicant as willing and able to follow company rules.  He recommended that Applicant\u2019s\nclearance be reinstated as he trusts him to follow the rules and finds him a real asset to his team.  He\nstated that Applicant had taken the training offered by the company on how to handle proprietary\ninformation.  (TR 168-177)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or absence\nof any adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole in evaluating this case, I weighed these relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines:\nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \n33. The Concern. Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulatiions for\nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s\ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such\ninformation, and is a serious security concern.\n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\n\n     Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n9\n       33. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  (b) collecting\n10\nor storing classified or other protected information at home or in any other unauthorized location; (c) loading,\ndrafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise handling classified reports, data, or other\ninformation on any unapproved equipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or\ncomputer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \u201cpalm\u201d or pocket device or other adjunct\nequipment;. (g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive information.\n9\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely\n9\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHandling Protected Information\nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s mishandling of protected\ninformation.  Applicant\u2019s conduct falls within conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying (DC) : (b), (c), (d).  Applicant admitted his conduct was a violation of security rules\n10\nwhen he made a decision to bring classified information and discs home where they could not\nproperly be secured.  When he disclosed these careless and expedient practices in polygraph\nexaminations, he was denied access to SCI and his secret clearance with that agency was revoked.\nAlthough he denied it, there was also evidence that he improperly storied classified information in\nhis office and refused a request to review the material there to assure its safeguarding.  By his\nconduct in 1993 to 1994 he violated provision of the Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding\nClassified Information (DoD 5220.22-M).  While he provided an explanation for why he engaged\nin these improper security practices, he provided no defense that was persuasive to either the agency\nwho denied him access or the company who terminated him when his access was denied.\nSignificantly, Applicant promptly reported these security access denial issues to his manager and also\nprovided details for the corporate security investigation.  Nevertheless, despite some remedial steps\non his part, the corporation made a decision to terminate him which he did not challenge. \n\n       35. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  (a) so much time has elapsed since\n11\nthe behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individuals current\u2019 reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement; (b)\nthe individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a\npositive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities; (c) the security vioaltions were due to\nimproper or inadequate training.\n10\nSubsequently, he had a variety of other corporate jobs.  As he was highly regarded for this\ntechnical expertise within the company, he was ultimately re-hired in 2003.   He remains highly\nregarded both by managers who knew him in his earlier tenure and by the managers who supervise\nhim since he was re-hired in 2003.  He established that he has reformed his conduct and provided\nsufficient evidence to demonstrate that he falls within mitigating conditions (MC).   Under MC (a),\n11\nApplicant has acknowledged his violations of security rules were serious and showed remorse.\nGiven his twenty year history with the company,  this behavior in taking these short-cuts was unusual\nand infrequent.  He previously had a prior history of compliance with security rules.  Any new\nviolations are unlikely to recur as he as had to focus on the seriousness and importance of these\nsecurity requirements.  In addition, he has sought additional security training from a consultant in\nthe field who could explain to him, not only the rule, but the rationale and basis for the rule.  Not\nonly does he predict such violations will not recur but all of the managers who know him testified\nfavorably on his behalf and recommended that his security clearance be reinstated.  He has taken\ncorrection action to overcome this serious problem. Also, these violations, while serious, did happen\noven ten years ago.  Now he has substantially reformed his conduct.   \nNotably, the chief engineer and company director who was Applicant\u2019s supervisor at the time\nof the security violations that led to his dismissal continues to view Applicant as \u201cfundamentally\ntrustworthy.\u201d  Also, he noted that Applicant  possesses talents that are of great value to the national\ndefense.  He concluded that Applicant learned the lesson on the \u201cuncompromising nature of\ninformation security rules\u201d and offered his assessment that Applicant will in the future abide by\nthem.  Consequently, he recommended the reinstatement of his security clearance.   \nAlso, his current supervisor views his current work performance as  good and recommended\nthat his clearance be reinstated.  All his supervisors and managers from the earlier work history and\nfrom the current work assignments express confidence in him as a reliable, trustworthy and a person\nof good judgment.  Also they all recommended him that his security clearance be reinstated.\nThus, I conclude Applicant established MC (a).  Significantly, he now shows a positive\nattitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities as demonstrated by his own testimony and\nthe assessment of high level managers. Consequently, he also falls within MC (b).  While there was\nno argument made that Applicant\u2019s violations occurred because of improper or inadequate training,\nand MC (c) does not apply, nevertheless he sought out additional security training and has complied\nwith all the current proprietary training required in his current position where he is uncleared but\nhandles other sensitive information with appropriate safeguards.  \nViewing him as a whole person, I find his transformation on the importance of security rules\npotent as his earlier motivation for taking these security short-cuts was not to advantage himself, but\nto juggle a heavy workload with his family responsibilities.  While his rationale does not excuse his\npast misconduct, it demonstrates that his motivation as his goal was to meet a very heavy workload\n\n11\nin a stressful environment of three projects conducted at three different locations.  Significantly, his\nsupervisor from the earlier period offered his assessment that Applicant\u2019s 1995 dismissal \u201cmade\npermanent the corrective action that will preclude any errant behavior hence forth.\u201d  \n After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule\nfor  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline K:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant spent additional time in a work-release program which the Judge did\nnot count as incarceration for purposes of Smith Act. Department Counsel challenges the Chief\nJudge\u2019s decision on that basis.  The Board notes that the Chief Administrative Judge highlighted the\nquestion at the hearing and left the record open for additional material on the question.  Nonetheless,\nthere are only two exhibits in the record (a security clearance application and a statement of subject\nprepared by Applicant) both of which were received at the hearing.  Under the Directive, Department\nCounsel has the burden of proving controverted facts in DOHA proceedings.  The question of\nwhether work-release should be considered incarceration for purposes of the Smith Act is a mixed\nquestion of fact and law.  The Board cannot assume that the many such programs functioning\nconcurrently in the Unites States necessarily impose the same restrictions on convicts.

On October 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 30, 2007. She submitted\na notarized, written response to the SOR allegations on November 16, 2007, and\nrequested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided\nApplicant with a complete copy on January 17, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nApril 2, 2008\n\nGiven the date she received the FORM, the month of January is incorrect and should be February.\n1\nItem 4 (Response to SOR, dated November 16, 2007).\n2\nItem 6 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated February 7, 2005) at 1- 2; Item 7 (2007 Bankruptcy\n3\nPetition) at 10.\nItem 6, supra note 3, at 3-4.\n4\nItem 4, supra note 2, at 3; Item 9 (Applicant\u2019s 1982 bankruptcy petition and order).\n5\n2\nJanuary 23, 2008. She had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She submitted a response,\ndated January 20, 2008, which included additional documentation.  The hearing office\n1\nassigned this case to me on March 5, 2008. The government submitted 23 exhibits,\nwhich have been marked as Items 1-23 and admitted into the record. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I concluded that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information must be denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated November 16, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.-1.j. of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual\nallegation in \u00b6 1.k of the SOR. She also provided additional information to support her\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n2\nApplicant, who is 51 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor.\nShe began her position as an operations co-ordinator in January 2007. She completed\nher security application in February 2005, while working for another Department of\nDefense contractor.3\nApplicant has a daughter, aged 34. In 1976, Applicant married her first husband.\nTwo sons, ages 30 and 23, were born during this marriage. Although she does not\nindicate when she and her first husband separated, they divorced in 1985. Applicant\nmarried her second husband in 1985 and they divorced in 1997. Applicant is currently\nsingle.  \n4\nIn 1982, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy because of her debts.\nThe bankruptcy petition identifies numerous debts, including unpaid taxes, and several\njudgments. The bankruptcy court discharged her debts on July 9, 1982. Applicant states\nthat she incurred these debts because her former husband did not help with child\nsupport.  \n5\nAt the time Applicant and her second husband divorced in 1997, physicians\ndiagnosed Applicant\u2019s mother with terminal cancer. Applicant became her sole care\ntaker and financial provider until she died. By so doing, Applicant stretched her financial\nresources beyond her abilities to pay. Her unpaid debts, including medical bills, disputed\n\nItem 4, supra note 2, at 2, 6, 10, 16-19; Item 8 (2002 Bankruptcy petition) at 4, 6, 8. \n6\nItem 4, supra note 2 at 1; Item 5 (Supplemental response to SOR with attachments, dated November 19,\n7\n2007) at 5-8.\nItem 4, supra note 2 at 4; Item 5, supra note 7, 6-10.\n8\nItem 4, supra note 2 at 1-2; Item 5 supra note 7, at 3; Item 7 (2007 bankruptcy petition); response to FORM,\n9\ndated February 20, 2008, at 3-4.\n3\nmedical bills, and utility bills but no credit card debts, accumulated. She filed a second\nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition. This petition reflected $56,000 in child support arrearage\nas personal property. The creditors listed in allegations 1.h. and 1.k. of the SOR are\nlisted as creditors in this bankruptcy petition. The court discharged her debts on March\n9, 2003, which included the creditors listed in allegations 1.h. and 1.k.   \n6\nIn January 2006, Applicant\u2019s then employer terminated her employment because\nof a reduction in force. She received severance pay which she used to pay living\nexpenses. She used her unemployment income to pay her mortgage, until she\nexhausted this benefit. In November 2006 when she could not make her mortgage\npayments, she submitted information to her mortgage company and requested hardship\nassistance.7\nApplicant began her current position in January 2007. She again contacted her\nmortgage company to determine the status of her request for assistance to resolve her\noverdue payments and to prevent foreclosure on her home. With the assistance of the\nmortgage company, Applicant developed a resolution plan. Despite this plan, the\nmortgage company started the foreclosure process. Applicant then contacted the\nmortgage company, which stopped the foreclosure. Applicant\u2019s mortgage resolution\nplan required her to make a balloon payment of $8,740 in June 2007, which she could\nnot and did not make. 8\nIn July 2007, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection to prevent\nforeclosure on her home. About this same time, she missed approximately two months\nfrom work for medical reasons. Much of this time, she received no pay. She has\ndeveloped and presented to the bankruptcy trustee a repayment plan, which requires\nher to pay $500 a month for 18 months beginning September 2007 and then, starting in\nFebruary 2009, $840 a month for 42 months. Her bankruptcy repayment plan includes\npayment on all existing debts, including debts she had been timely paying and IRS\ntaxes for 2006, when she received unemployment benefits. The bankruptcy court\napproved her repayment plan on February 5, 2008.9\nApplicant prepared a financial statement as part of her bankruptcy plan. The\nstatement includes her mortgage payment and a car payment, which are now part of\nher bankruptcy repayment plan. She has sufficient income to pay the initial $500 a\nmonth payment. She has not submitted a revised financial statement indicating her new\nmonthly expenses or how she intends to make the $840 a month payments beginning in\n\nItem 7, supra note 9, at 10-11.\n10\nItem 10 (Credit report, dated August 16, 2007); Item 11 (Credit report, dated June 21, 2007); Item 12 (Credit\n11\nreport, dated April 27, 2005); Item 8, supra note 6.\nItem 5, supra note 6, at 15; Item 13 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated February 27, 1986); Item 14 (Applicant\u2019s\n12\nstatement, dated June 21, 1989); Item 15 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated November 19, 2001); Item 16\n(Applicant\u2019s statement, dated June 26, 2002).\n4\nFebruary 2009. In addition, she has not submitted any evidence that she made any\npayments under her Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan.10\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports dated August 2007, June 2007, and April 2005 do not\nshow excessive spending and over-use of credit cards by Applicant. The reports show\nthree unidentified medical bills (Applicant tentatively identified these debts in her\nanswer) and three judgments, which are listed in the SOR. The judgment for $282\nrelates to a medical bill included as a debt in her 2002 bankruptcy petition and\ndischarged by the court on March 9, 2003. Outside of her overdue mortgage payments,\nApplicant\u2019s remaining debts listed in the SOR total $1,111. The judgments and\npreviously discharged debts are also listed in her Chapter 13 repayment plan.11\nApplicant previously submitted requests for security clearances. The record\ncontains four signed, sworn statements from Applicant, which indicate financial\nproblems and unpaid debt from the 1970s until June 2002. At least once, her earlier\nfinancial problems resulted from unemployment, but any other causes of her debts are\nunknown. After her security clearance was revoke in 2002, her then employer requested\na waiver because the company viewed her as a valuable employee.12\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n5\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG &\n19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ and AG & 19(c), Aa history of not\nmeeting financial obligations@ are the relevant potentially disqualifying conditions in this\ncase and may raise security concerns. For many years, Applicant incurred, at times,\nsignificant delinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to apply these disqualifying\nconditions in this case.\n\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Because\nApplicant has a long history financial problems, spanning more than 25 years, this\nmitigating condition is not relevant in this case.\nUnder AG & 20(b), mitigation may exist when Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s most recent\nfinancial difficulties occurred when she lost her job in January 2006 because of a\nreduction-in-force. She paid her mortgage for many months, but since she did not obtain\nemployment for a year and her unemployment benefits expired, she could not continue\nmaking her monthly payments. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant contacted the mortgage company for assistance in\nresolving her overdue debt. She worked out a resolution plan, but could not make the\nballoon payment in June 2007. To prevent foreclosure on her home, she filed for\nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection. The court has approved her repayment plan. These\nare potentially mitigating factors to be considered in this case. The remaining mitigating\nconditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20 (f), are not applicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began,\nApplicant was a young woman, married with young children. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(4).) Her\n1982 bankruptcy documents indicate that she accumulated unpaid debt due to\nexcessive spending and living beyond her financial means. Although she claims that her\ndebts were the result of her first husband\u2019s failure to pay child support, the evidence\nreflects that she and he did not divorce until 1985, three years after her bankruptcy filing\n(See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1).) Since that time, Applicant has continued to experience significant\nfinancial problems. She does not spend money in the same manner as she did when\nshe was young; however, she continues to incur unpaid debts on a regular basis. She\nprovided financial support for her ailing mother in 1997 and lost her job in 2006. Both of\nthese events impacted her finances negatively. She plans to repay her latest debts\nthrough the repayment plan she developed under the auspices of the bankruptcy\ntrustee. She has not provided sufficient evidence to show that she has complied with or\ncan comply with her repayment plan, nor has she shown any real change in her\nfinancial management. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(3), 2(a)(6).) Her continuous debt issues raise\nconcerns about pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Given\nher inability to manage her income and expenses, there is a likelihood that she will incur\ndebts in the future, and will not be able to pay them. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising because of her\nfinancial issues. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 18, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 31, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings;\nwhether the Judge erred in concluding Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application\nwas deliberate; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuidelines E and J had not been mitigated.\n(1) Applicant asserts that the Judge erred with respect to a number of findings relating to the\nnature, circumstances, and timing of Applicant\u2019s April 2001 arrest on four felony counts of \u201cChild\nAbuse Parent.\u201d  However, even if each of the challenged findings of fact were changed to reflect\nApplicant\u2019s interpretation of the record evidence, it would not have undermined the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions.  Therefore, any such error would be at best harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 05-08459 at\n2, n. 1 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2006).  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the\nJudge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern do not reflect a\nreasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a\nwhole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.\n(2) Applicant also contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose adverse information in response to three different questions.  In\nsupport of this contention, he argues that the omission of the information was due to a\nmisunderstanding on his part, and he subsequently provided the correct information.  The Board does\nnot find this argument persuasive.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was\ndeliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\nThe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification were not necessarily overcome by\nApplicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJan. 22, 2004).  \n(3) Finally, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised by his falsifications had not been mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues\nthat his falsifications were an isolated incident outweighed by the favorable evidence presented by\nthe Applicant.  The Board does not find these arguments persuasive.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\n\n3\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was\nbefore her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is\nsustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

On\n1\nFebruary 14, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security\nclearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR\ndetailed reasons under Guideline K (Security Violations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted or revoked.\nIn a document, dated February 28, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 1, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued\non March 5, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 21, 2007. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. At the hearing, the Government offered 13 exhibits, Exs. 1-13. Applicant offered two\nexhibits, Exs. A and B. All exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 2.a, and 2.b. Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. He denied the allegation in\nsubparagraph 1.b. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 55 years old and has been working for a defense contractor since 1986.  In 1974,\n2\nhe graduated from the Air Force Academy. He retired from the Air Force as a major in July 1986.\nHe had security clearances in the past.

His home was not an authorized location to\nsafeguard classified material. He revealed these facts in 1983 during a polygraph examination.5\nIn 1998, while employed by a defense contractor, Applicant and some other employees\npacked approximately 25 cardboard boxes of his belongings to be moved. An unmarked envelope\ncontaining classified documents was inadvertently packed.  Applicant discovered the classified\n6\ndocuments in a box in March 2001. He took the documents home and stored them there until July\n2001, in an attempt to conceal when the security violation occurred. In a letter dated February11,\n2002 to his superior, he relayed some of the details of what occurred. In a letter dated March 19,\n2002, he admitted that the earlier letter was incorrect and he corrected the inaccuracy.7\nOne witness testified on behalf of the Government. The witness and Applicant work for the\nsame employer. This witness was the security investigator for Applicant\u2019s case.  His report indicated\n8\nApplicant\u2019s security violation was a \u201creportable incident,\u201d because there was the potential for\ncompromise of classified information. The witness concluded Applicant took classified material to\nhis home for a period of three months. Applicant indicated no one had seen the documents, but that\npoint could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  A security violation report was generated after\n9\nthe investigation and sent to the director of the organization.  The director found that Applicant\u2019s\n10\nsecurity breach was a major violation, since there was a chance that classified information could\nhave been compromised. As a result of his security violations, he was disciplined by being placed\non a two-week suspension from work without pay from April 20, 2002 to May 3, 2002. A copy of\nthe security violation memorandum of disciplinary action was permanently placed in his personnel\nrecord. He was placed on probation for six months. \nThree character witnesses testified at the hearing. The first witness worked with Applicant\nin 1995. He supervised Applicant from 1996 until 2004.  On discovering his security violations, he\n11\nsuspended him for two weeks without pay.  He continued to trust Applicant despite his infraction.\n12\n13\n\nTr. 35.\n14\nTr. 33-34.\n15\nTr. 41.\n16\nId.\n17\nTr. 42.\n18\nTr. 43.\n19\nTr. 43-44.\n20\nTr. 49.\n21\nTr. 50.\n22\nTr. 52.\n23\nEx.

He endorses Applicant for a security clearance.\n14\n15\nThe second witness is a retired U.S. Navy captain currently working with Applicant.  They\n16\nmet in 1992 at work. He was Applicant\u2019s supervisor for three years, until 1995.  Since 1999, they\n17\nbecame reacquainted on various projects at Applicant\u2019s current job.  Although he was not aware of\n18\nthe specific 2002 incident regarding the document, he testified that he has never had a question about\nthe integrity or loyalty of Applicant.  This witness recommended that Applicant retain a security\n19\nclearance.  \n20\nThe third witness has known Applicant for at least 20 years. Their friendship began at church,\ncontinued through rearing their children, and community events.  This witness retired in 2001 from\n21\na government agency as an analyst after 27 years.  He believes Applicant is trustworthy and believes\n22\nhe should be granted a security clearance. He vouches for Applicant\u2019s character.23\nTwo character witnesses submitted affidavits. His current manager since 2006, holds a top\nsecret clearance, and has worked with Applicant since the early 1990s. She knew about his security\nviolation because he directly reported to her. She stated:\nI was frankly surprised, since it did not fit with any of my experience with\n[Applicant].  I have had several discussions with him about this violation, and I truly\nbelieve that he has leaned his lesson. I recommend that [Applicant] retain his DoD\nclearances.24\nThe other witness has known and interacted with Applicant often at work for the past five\nyears. She too heartedly endorses Applicant for maintaining his security clearance.25\n\nTr. 59.\n26\nTr. 60.\n27\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n28\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n29\nDepartment of the Navy v.

He includes a session on ethical behavior\nbased on his security infractions.  He testified: \u201cHaving made a mistake, I kind a [sic] speak with\n26\npassion on the subject of integrity and honesty, and I think I\u2019ve been highly effective in getting\npeople to think about these things.\u201d27\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n28\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n29\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n30\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.31\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.32\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n33\nId.\n34\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n35\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n36\n7\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n33\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n34\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n35\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n36\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nSecurity Violations\nSecurity violations is always a concern because noncompliance with security regulations raises\ndoubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified\ninformation. \nOn two occasions in 1980, without authority, Applicant failed to properly protect classified\ninformation. He took Secret documents to his residence, which was not an authorized location to store\nclassified material. In 1998, classified documents in his possession were inadvertently packed. He\ndiscovered them in his office in March 2001. He took those documents to his home and stored them\nthere until July 2001. He revealed his security violations in 2002. Thus, Security Violations\nDisqualifying Condition E2.A11.1.2.2 (violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence)\napplies. The Government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline K,\nsecurity violations. \nVarious factors can mitigate security violations security concerns. The two incidents in 1980\nof failure to properly protect classified information properly can be mitigated by time as they took\nplace over 27 years ago. In 1998, he inadvertently packed classified documents in a cardboard box and\ndiscovered them in March 2001. Upon discovering the documents in 2001, he took them to his home\nto prevent discovery of his infraction. In February 2002, he self-reported part of what he had done. In\nMarch 2002, he self-reported the entire incident. This incident took place over five years ago. There\nhave been no lapses in protecting classified documents since 2002, demonstrating his positive attitude\nconcerning his security responsibilities. Thus, Security Violations Mitigating Conditions (SV MC)\nE2.A11.1.3.1 (were inadvertent), SV MC E2.A11.3.3 (were isolated or infrequent), and SV MC\nE2.A11.1.3.4 (demonstrated a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities)\napply. Thus, Applicant has mitigated the security violations security concerns. Accordingly, allegations\n1.a through 1.c of the SOR are concluded for Applicant.\n\n8\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question whether the\nperson\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\nApplicant deliberately provided false and misleading information to his employer in 2002\nregarding his discovery of classified documents in his office in March 2001 and taking them home\nuntil July 2001 in an attempt to conceal the security violations. He self-reported the incident in\nFebruary 2002 but only told parent of the story. In March 2002, he made a full disclosure of his\ninfractions. Almost a year had passed before Applicant  decided to report his unethical behavior, and\nthen he provided false or misleading information before providing the correct information.\nConsequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (a pattern of dishonesty\nor rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the\nindividual and the agency) apply. \nVarious factors can mitigate personal conduct security concerns. Honesty is critical to a\nposition of trust in protecting classified information. The security violation incidents that occurred in\nthe 1980s are mitigated by time. Applicant did self-report the security violations that took place in\n2001. Thus, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition E2.A5.1.3.3 (the falsification was an isolated\nincident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily)\napplies. However, the 2001 incident is not completely mitigated due to Applicant deliberately\nproviding false and misleading information to his employer in 2002. Accordingly, allegation 2.a of the\nSOR is concluded for Applicant. Allegation 2.b of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nappeared remorseful at the hearing. He credibly testified that he is sorry for his transgressions in not\nprotecting classified documents under his control. Based on the totality of his mishandling of classified\ndocuments, Applicant learned little from his 1980s mishaps. If he truly understood the ramifications\nof his behavior in the 1980s regarding protection of classified documents, the subsequent failures to\nprotect classified documents in 2001 and 2002 would not have occurred.

Moreover, the Judge is not required\nto cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd.\nSept. 18, 1992).  Close cases should be resolved in favor of national security, rather than in favor of\nthe Applicant.  See, e.g. DISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge committed harmful error by basing his decision on the\nDirective\u2019s Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Guidelines rather than the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines were circulated to agencies involved in security clearance\ndeterminations after December 29, 2005.  They were implemented by the Department of Defense\nin a memo dated August 30, 2006, for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The SOR in\nApplicant\u2019s case was issued on May 14, 2004.  The Judge correctly based his decision on the\nAdjudicative Guidelines in effect at that time.  See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov.\n14, 2006).\nApplicant is essentially challenging the implementation of the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines by the Under Secretary of Defense.  The Board\u2019s jurisdiction and authority are limited\nto reviewing security clearance decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges.  See Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 through E3.1.35.  Nothing in the Directive gives the Board the jurisdiction or authority\nto pass judgment on the wisdom or desirability of guidance provided by the Under Secretary of\nDefense.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0457 at 5 (App. Bd.  Jan. 3, 2001).  \n\n3\n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s denial of a security clearance under the Directive\nconflicts with Applicant\u2019s constitutional rights to freely exercise his religion and educate his\nchildren, and his statutory rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  The Board has no\njurisdiction or authority to adjudicate Applicant\u2019s claim in this regard.\nThe Supreme Court has acknowledged the inherently discretionary nature of security\nclearance decisions and concluded \u201c[i]t should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security\nclearance.\u201d  Department of Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 527-28 (1988).  Given the inherently\ndiscretionary nature of security clearance decisions, no applicant has any reasonable expectation of\nhaving a vested interest in or right to a security clearance.  Moreover, the federal courts have\nrepeatedly held there is no property right or interest in a security clearance or a job requiring a\nsecurity clearance.  See Jones v. Navy, 978 F.2d, 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992); Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF.2d 1399, 1403-04 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991); Doe v. Cheney, 885 F.2d 898,\nth\n909 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Chesna v. U.S. Department of Defense, 850 F. Supp. 110, 118-19 (D. Conn.\n1994); Williams v. Reilly, 743 F. Supp. 168, 172 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).\nThe Board\u2019s jurisdiction and authority is limited to reviewing security clearance adjudications\nmade under the Directive. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 through E3.1.35.  The Board does not have the\njurisdiction or authority to entertain challenges to the wisdom or legality of provisions of the\nDirective.  See DISCR Case No. 90-0208 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 1991)(no Board authority to hold\nthat the Directive is unconstitutional); DISCR Case No. 99-0457 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2001) citing\nThunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 215 (1994)(adjudication of constitutionality of\nstatutes is beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies).  Nor does the Board have jurisdiction\nor authority to adjudicate an applicant\u2019s rights under provisions of the U.S. Code. See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-33144 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sept. 7, 2004).  The Board has reviewed the record in this case and\nconcludes that the Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order\n10865 and the Directive.\n(3) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law because it is inconsistent with the decisions of other Hearing Office Judges in\nostensibly similar cases.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe decisions in other DOHA Hearing Office cases cited by Applicant on appeal do not\ndemonstrate error by the Judge in this case.  A decision by a Hearing Office Judge is not legally\nbinding precedent on that Judge\u2019s colleagues in other cases, even if Applicant establishes close\nfactual similarities between the cited cases and the instant case.  ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 31, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-23776 at 3 (App. Bd. June 13, 2006).  Likewise, the cited\ncases are not legally binding precedent on the Board, and the Board need not reconcile the Judge\u2019s\ndecision below with those decisions.  ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006); ISCR\nCase No. 01-22606 at 3-5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2003).  To the extent those decisions offer a persuasive\nalternative analysis for the facts and circumstances of the present case that could lead to a different\nresult, they are of no moment.  As noted above, the Board does not review cases de novo, and it may\nnot substitute its judgment for that of the Judge.\n(4) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to law because Applicant was granted a clearance in 1996 in order to execute a government\n\n4\nproject, and held that clearance without any problems until the project was completed in 1999.\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Board has previously held that there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing a security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n00318 at 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004); ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2005).  Prior\nsecurity clearance adjudications and the granting of clearances for the Applicant have no bearing on\nthe legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision here. See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 03-\n04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).   The government is not estopped from making an adverse\nclearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n24506 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 11, 2003).  In that regard, the government has the right to reconsider the\nsecurity significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct or\ncircumstances having negative security significance.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 91-0775 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 25, 1992); ISCR Case No. 02-17609 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).\n(5) Applicant argues that the evidence he provided in the proceeding below was sufficient\nto require the Judge to conclude, as a matter of law, that he had rebutted, mitigated or extenuated the\nsecurity concerns raised by the Guideline B allegations.  In support of that argument, Applicant\ncontends that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s sons are vulnerable to coercion is unsupported\nby the record.  She also contends that the Judge gave insufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s favorable\nevidence, including the fact that: Applicant was a U.S. citizen by birth, with long-standing personal,\nfamily and financial ties to the U.S.; she had renounced her Israeli citizenship and given up her\nIsraeli passport; she had previously held a clearance with any problems; and her family members in\nIsrael held U.S. citizenship.  Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard does not demonstrate that the Judge\nerred.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them\napplies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound\ndiscretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App.\nBd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  Applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a\nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nApplicant had the burden of presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate facts\nthat the Department Counsel proved or that Applicant admitted regarding her foreign family and\npersonal ties and financial interest.  Applicant also had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to\nobtaining a favorable security clearance decision.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge had to evaluate\nthe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide whether Applicant had met her burden of persuasion under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The fact that Applicant\u2019s explanations and her mitigating evidence did not lead\n\n5\nthe Judge to the decision desired by Applicant does not establish error.  The presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of\nApplicant under Guidelines C and E, and articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any\nmitigating conditions or factors with respect to the Guideline B allegations.  He reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  \nThe Judge's decision shows that he did more than merely verbalize an adherence to the\n\"whole-person\" concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-24428 at 5 (App. Bd. May 3, 2006).  The\ndecision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number of variables to reach a commonsense\ndetermination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  In some instances, as noted earlier, this process led to favorable\nfindings for Applicant.  However, the Judge also articulated a reasonable concern that Applicant's\ncircumstances could potentially make her vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure\u2014an\nimportant consideration in the \"whole-person\" analysis.  Directive E2.2.1.8.  The concern is based\non a combination of close family and personal ties and a substantial financial interest in Israel,\nconsidered in the context of the overall political/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United\nStates.  Applicant offers a rational alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  However, that\nalternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation\narbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13,\n2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational explanation for his unfavorable determination under the\ndisqualifying and mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there is sufficient record\nevidence to support that determination\u2014given the standard that required the Judge to err on the side\nof national security.\nOrder\n\n6\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

On March 15, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\n\n2\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn June 16, 2006, after the hearing, Chief Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Chief Administrative\nJudge\u2019s application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 1 is arbitrary, capricious, and\ncontrary to the record evidence; and whether the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nis unsustainable because the whole-person considerations relied upon are unsupported by the record\nevidence and their application is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.

In May 2006, Libya was removed from the U.S. State Department\u2019s list of sponsors\nof state-sponsored terrorism, and formal diplomatic relations have been restored.  \nInternally, beginning in 1984, thousands of Libyans were imprisoned and interrogated, with\nmany being executed because of a failed coup attempt.  It was at that time that \nB.  Discussion\nThe appeal involves the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nOur scope of review under this standard is narrow, and we may not substitute our judgment for that\nof the Administrative Judge.  We review matters of law  de novo.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Chief Administrative Judge erred by applying FIMC 11\nand concluding that Applicant\u2019s family in Libya is not in a position to be exploited by the Libyan\ngovernment.  Department Counsel contends that the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusion\nregarding the possibility of exploitation is arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by the record\nevidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  Application of FIMC 1 requires that an\napplicant\u2019s relatives in a foreign country not be agents of a foreign government and that they not be\nin a position to be exploited by a foreign government in a way that could influence the applicant to\nact in a way that would be detrimental to the United States.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-04648 at\n4 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2007).\nThe Chief Administrative Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s family members have no ties to the\nLibyan government, although he found that Applicant and his father have each had personal\ninteractions with a very senior Libyan official.  The Chief Administrative Judge noted the repressive\nnature of the Libyan government, but stated that the \u201cdomestic reign of terror and violation of human\n\nDecision at 12.\n2\nApplicant\u2019s testimony is consistent with Government Exhibit 2 for Official Notice\u2014the 2004 U.S. Department\n3\nof State Libya Country Report on Human Rights Practices which states that the Libyan regime \u201c. . . routinely monitored\ntelephone calls.\u201d\n\u201cContact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3.\n4\n4\nrights has apparently modified over time.\u201d   The record indicates that Applicant\u2019s parents have been\n2\nthreatened, and that Applicant himself then refrained from contacting them for many  years, fearing\nthat they would be harmed because of their relationship to him.  Applicant began calling them\nsubsequently, after a brother contacted him from Europe and told him to do so.  Applicant now calls\nthem regularly, but only speaks of inconsequential things. (The Chief Administrative Judge cites to\npages 75-76 of the transcript for this finding.  On the same pages, Applicant explains that his reason\nfor keeping the conversations mundane is his belief and, he thinks, his family\u2019s belief that their\nphone conversations are tapped.)   The Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\n3\nfamily members are not a position to be exploited by the Libyan government, and thus his\napplication of FIMC 1, is not supported by the record. \nThe Chief Administrative Judge performed a whole-person analysis.  Department Counsel\nargues that the Chief Administrative Judge based his whole-person analysis in part on conclusions\nwhich are unsupported by record evidence.  One example of lack of support in the record is the Chief\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s application of FIMC 1, as discussed above.  Another is the Chief\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s characterization of Applicant\u2019s family in Libya, which we construe as an\nimplicit application of FIMC 3.   While Applicant down-played his relationship with his family, the\n4\nrecord indicates that Applicant speaks regularly with his parents and is concerned for their safety.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant\u2019s contacts with family members are not casual.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-04648 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2007).  Applicant had the burden of\nproving that his ties to his family are casual in nature.  Applicant has not met that burden.  The Chief\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s conclusion on the matter is not supported by the record.\nThe Board does not agree with Department Counsel that the factors listed in E2.2.2.1 of the\nDirective are the only ones that may be considered in performing a whole-person analysis in a\nGuideline B case.  Other matters such as evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal attachments; the nature\nand extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country; his or her\nsocial ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case can properly be\nfactored into a judge\u2019s evaluation of an applicant\u2019s worthiness for a security clearance.  See,\ne.g.,ISCR Case No. 04-00631 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sept. 6, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 (App.\nBd. June 7, 2006).  The consideration for the Board is whether in a given case a judge\u2019s whole-\nperson analysis supports his or her final decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd.\nJan. 5, 2007).\nIn this case, however, the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s analysis is not sustainable in part\nbecause it relies on his misapplication of FIMCs 1 and 3.   Furthermore, the Chief Administrative\nJudge\u2019s favorable analysis relied on his misplaced view  that Applicant has \u201cwalked the walk.\u201d  The\nBoard agrees with the general proposition that an applicant\u2019s track record is very important and can\nlead to a favorable result for an applicant in a Guideline B case.  See, ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at\n5-6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006).  However, this Applicant\u2019s expressed opposition to a foreign\n\nThe Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s findings in this regard derive from Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and the\n5\nexhibits and testimony presented at the hearing.  Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 14 on his Security Clearance\nApplication, which asked: \u201cHave you ever had any contact with a foreign government, its establishments (embassies or\nconsulates), or its representatives, whether inside or outside the U.S., other than on official U.S. Government business?\u201d\n5\nregime\u2014for personal reasons\u2014is not commensurate with \u201ccredible, independent evidence\u201d of ties\nto the United States, or, e.g., a prior history of \u201c. . . compliance with security procedures and\nregulations . . . in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made\na significant contribution to the national security.\u201d  See, e.g., id. citing ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at\n2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006).  The probative value of such opposition is even lower when expressed\nin a context such as Applicant\u2019s deportation hearing.  Similarly, where an applicant has no\nsignificant track record of complying with security rules and practices, such opposition is of less\nweight.  \nThe Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusory statement that Applicant has very close ties to\nthe U.S. is not supported by his own findings of fact.  Indeed, there is a paucity of independent\nrecord evidence in that regard.  Aside from the evidence relating to Applicant\u2019s opposition to the\nLibyan regime, the remaining favorable facts recited by the Judge either do not readily suggest\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation or have low probative value.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-\n00109 at 5 (App. Bd. July 13, 2006).  Furthermore, the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s reference to\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cloyalties in and to the U.S.\u201d is problematic given the language of Executive Order\n10865 that these proceedings \u201cshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nIn this case, the evidence indicates that Applicant has close ties to multiple  immediate family\nmembers who live under a repressive regime.  The Board has previously held that an applicant with\nimmediate family members living in a country hostile to the U.S. has a heavy burden to show that\nthose family ties do not pose a security risk.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug.\n25, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09053 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006).  As a result, Applicant has a\ngreater burden than would be the case for an applicant with relatives living under another sort of\ngovernment. Compare ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-\n19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The record evidence also indicates that Applicant is not\nunconcerned about his family\u2019s fate.  Compare ISCR Case No. 04-06564 at 4 (App. Bd. May 30,\n2006); ISCR Case No. 04-00631 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 6, 2006).  \nMoreover, the record evidence indicates that Applicant and his family have not only been\npreviously targeted for coercion, exploitation and pressure by the Libyan regime,  but remain, in\n5\nApplicant\u2019s view, currently subject to Libyan surveillance.  As noted above, Applicant testified that\nhe believes his current phone conversations with his family are tapped.  He also indicated that his\nfamily believes the same thing.  The Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s decision only analyzes the Libyan\nregime\u2019s actions in regard to Applicant\u2019s ability to resist pressures similar to those Applicant\nencountered in the past.  However, Chief Administrative Judge provides no analysis or discussion\nas to how the combination of past and current circumstances heighten the security concerns\npresented in this case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00109 at 5-6 (App. Bd. July 13, 2006).  Indeed,\nthe Chief Administrative Judge states that \u201cthe mere possession of family ties with a person in a\n\nAs authority for this statement, the Chief Administrative Judge cites to the decision of a fellow Administrative\n6\nJudge in ISCR Case No. 03-21434 (A.J. May 24, 2006).  That case was remanded by the Appeal Board because of error\non the part of the Judge.  See ISCR Case No. 03-21434 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007).  The Board has previously noted that\ndecisions by Hearing Office Judges are not legally binding precedent on that Judge\u2019s colleagues or the Board. ISCR Case\nNo. 04-04004 at 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006). \n6\nforeign country should not, as a matter of law, be disqualifying under Guideline B.\u201d   He then\n6\nconcludes: \u201cBased on the evidence, . . . the security concerns manifested by the government, in this\ninstance, are largely unfounded.\u201d  Decision at 12.  The Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusion in\nthis regard ignores his own findings regarding the nature of the Libyan regime and the significance\nof the record of its prior treatment and current surveillance of Applicant and his family by that\nregime.  Such factors are \u201c. . . important evidence that provides context for all the other evidence of\nrecord and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 04-07766 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006).  \nIn light of the foregoing, the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is\nunsustainable in that it fails to consider an import aspect of the case, fails to articulate a satisfactory\nexplanation for its conclusions, and offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the\nrecord evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (July 14, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs.\nAss\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 21, 2005,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive\n\n\u201cA determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in\n1\na position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the\nperson(s) involved and the United States . . .\u201d  Directive  \u00b6  E2.A2.1.3.1.\nDepartment Counsel does not challenge the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guidelines F and E.  Therefore,\n2\nthey are not at issue in this case.\nApplicant Exhibit C includes an evaluation of Applicant\u2019s duty performance.  Written on stationary bearing\n3\nthe letterhead of Combined Forces Command - Afghanistan, it states in part that Applicant is a \u201ccritical link\u201d between\nthe U.S. and the Afghan people.  \u201cOf special note, his mastery of five languages and cultural expertise has earned him\nthe respect and trust of our Deputy Commanding General. [Applicant] is often called upon to translate and verify\nstrategic-level documents for the Commander.\u201d  Another document contained in this exhibit states that Applicant has\nassisted in \u201cseveral joint planning groups to solve a myriad of problems surfacing in Afghanistan . . . [S]everal important\n[Afghan officials] will speak only through Applicant.\u201d    \n2\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 23, 2006,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola  granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 1;  and whether the Judge\u2019s whole\n1\nperson analysis was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.   Finding error, we remand the case\n2\nto the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has two brothers who are\ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan.  Both are carpenters.  They have no connection with the\nAfghan government.\nApplicant has worked for the Afghan government, without pay, from March to July of 2004.\nHe worked for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan from December 2004 until June 2005.  The \u201cDeputy\nCommanding General\u201d of the U.S. Army in Afghanistan thinks most highly of Applicant, and other\nU.S. Army officers echo the general\u2019s comments.   \n3\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \n\n3\nIn his discussion of the first asserted error, Department Counsel noted that the Judge\u2019s\nfindings include nothing about the nature of the Afghan government or the nature of threats posed\nby groups such as terrorists and para-military organizations operating within Afghanistan.\nDepartment Counsel notes that the Judge\u2019s failure to address the geopolitical conditions in\nAfghanistan render his decision arbitrary and capricious.  Security concerns under Guideline B are\nnot limited to influence exercised by foreign governments.  Such concerns can arise from the\noperation of non-governmental groups, such as terrorist organizations, within a foreign country.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-22643 at 8 (App. Bd. June 24, 2005)(\u201cThe Board has rejected the contention that\nthere is no rational connection between terrorism and threats to the security of classified U.S.\ninformation.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 9 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004).   \nIn this case, the Judge\u2019s failure to make findings concerning the geopolitical situation within\nAfghanistan impairs his analysis, both of Guideline B and of the whole person.  Therefore, we\nremand the case to the Judge for a new opinion, under Guideline B and the whole person.  The new\nopinion should include a more detailed whole person analysis, which takes into account the dangers\nexisting in Afghanistan insofar as they have a bearing on the potential for coercion.  Also, as\nappropriate, it should detail and explain Applicant\u2019s pertinent qualities, characteristics, and\ncircumstances which are the basis for the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a clearance is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

They were\ncaused by circumstances largely beyond his control, an unexpected medical emergency.  He now has\na positive monthly cash flow.  In answer to question 33 on his November 2003 Security Clearance\nApplication (SCA), the Applicant failed to disclose his August 1997 bankruptcy as he thought seven\nyears had passed.  In answer to questions 38 and 39, he misunderstood the questions, but has\nsubsequently disclosed all of the requested information on an October 2004 Questionnaire for\nNational Security Positions (QNSP).  The Applicant has little contact with his two Afghanistani\nbrothers, who are carpenters.  He worked for the Afghan government from March to July of 2004,\nbut for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan from December 2004 to June of 2005.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 21 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about August 11, 2005.\nThe case was originally assigned to another judge, but was reassigned to the undersigned on\nMay 1, 2006.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 4, 2006, and the case was heard on May 25,\n2006.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant,\nwho called one witness to testify on his behalf.  The transcript (TR) was received on June 2, 2006.\nThe issues raised here are whether the Applicant's admitted Financial Considerations, related\nPersonal Conduct, and alleged Foreign Influence militate against the granting of a security clearance.\n[The Applicant admits the Financial Considerations of Paragraph 1, but denies the Alleged Personal\nConduct, also incorrectly included under Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  He denies the allegations of\nForeign Influence styled under Paragraph 2.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 60 years, and is employed by a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\n\n3\n1.i. The Applicant was involved in an accident with an uninsured motorist; and as a result,\nsuffered numerous medical bills, which caused him to file for the protection of a Chapter 7\nBankruptcy in 1997 (TR at page 44 line 11 to page 46 line 1, and Government Exhibit (GX) 2).  He\nhas now addressed all of his admitted past due debts, and has a positive monthly cash flow of\n$1,000~$1,500 (TR at page 46 lines 2~22).\n1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant is making monthly payments of $500 to a hospital, for a past due\ndebt totaling $7,053.25, as of March 1, 2006 (TR at page 37 line 9 to page 40 line 15, and\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppX) A at pages 1~3).\n1.c.  The Applicant settled his debt with a telephone provider for $537.95, to the satisfaction\nof the creditor (TR at page 40 lines 16~24, and AppX A at page 4).\n1.d.  The Applicant settled his debt with a second hospital for $4,441.33, to the satisfaction\nof the creditor (TR at page 40 line 25 to page 41 line 11, and AppX A at page 5).\n1.e.  The Applicant has formally disputed a $66 debt to another phone company (TR at page\n41 line 12 to page 42 line 15, and AppX E at page 2).\n1.f.  The Applicant settled his $156 debt with a video store, to the satisfaction of the creditor\n(TR at page 42 line 16 to page 43 line 16, and AppX A at page 8).  He now has \u201ca $0 balance\u201d\n(AppX A at page 8).\n1.g.  The Applicant settled his debt with a credit card company for $1,600, to the satisfaction\nof the creditor (TR at page 43 lines 17~24, and AppX A at pages 9~10).\n1.h.  The Applicant has formally disputed a $25 debt to third phone company (TR at page 43\nline 25 to page 44 line 10, and AppX E at page 2).\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n1.a.(duplicate)  In answer to question 33 on his November 2003 SCA, the Applicant failed\nto disclose his August 1997 bankruptcy (GX 4 at page 9).  He mistakenly thought that seven years\nhad passed since he filed the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, when, in fact, six years and nearly three months\nhad passed (TR at page 46 line 23 to page 52 line 19).  There was no intention to deceive the\nGovernment, however, and the Applicant did disclose this filing in a subsequent October 2004\nQNSP (Id, and AppX B at page 8).\n1.b. and 1.c.(duplicates)  In answer to questions 38 and 39 on his November 2003 SCA, the\nApplicant failed to disclose his debts in excess of 90 days and 180 days past due (GX 4 at page 9).\nHe testified, credibly, that he misread the questions, as English is not his native language (TR at page\n52 line 20 to page 54 line 19).  There was no intention to deceive the Government, and the Applicant\ndid disclose his delinquencies in his subsequent October 2004 QNSP (Id, and AppX B at page 9).\nHis credibility is testified to by one who knows the Applicant in the community, and by those U.S.\nArmy Officers who served with the Applicant in Afghanistan (TR at page 83 line 5 to page 91 line\n17, and AppX C at pages 1 and 2).\n\n4\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a.  The Applicant\u2019s two brothers are citizens and residents of Afghanistan (GX 4 at page\n4).  They are both carpenters, and have no connection with the Afghan government (TR at 54 line\n25 to page 55 line 24, and at page 58 lines 6~9).  Furthermore, the Applicant is not subject to\ncoercion vis-a-vis his foreign relatives (Tr at page 105 lines 1~23).\n2.b.  The Applicant worked for the Afghan government, without pay, from March to July of\n2004 (TR at page 56 line 4 to page 57 line 13).  Most recently, however, he worked for the U.S.\nArmy in Afghanistan from December 2004 to June of 2005 (TR at page 58 line 10 to page 60 line\n16, and at page 63 lines 1~18).\nMitigation\nThe \u201cDeputy Commanding General\u201d for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan thinks most highly\nof the Applicant, and other U.S. Army Officers echo the General\u2019s comments (AppX C at pages 1\nand 2).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\n\n5\nThe Government must make out a case under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence), E (Personal\nConduct), and F (Financial Considerations); which establishes doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an\napplicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with\nrespect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\n\n6\nUnacceptable Personal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The\nGovernment must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide\nby all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nConsidering first the Applicant\u2019s Financial Considerations, the first and third disqualifying\nconditions are applicable as the Applicant had a \u201chistory of not meeting [his] financial obligations,\u201d\nand there was an \u201c[i]inabilty or unwillingness to satisfy [his] debts.\u201d  However, the Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties can be directly attributed to circumstances \u201clargely beyond . . . [his] control\n(e.g., . . . unexpected medical emergency . . . ).\u201d  The third mitigating condition is therefore\napplicable.  Furthermore, the Applicant has now addressed all of his admitted past due debts.  The\nlast mitigating condition is therefore applicable, as he has \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline F is found for the\nApplicant.\nAs to his alleged wilful falsification, I can find no intent to keep information from the\nGovernment.  When the Applicant filled out his SCA, he thought seven years had passed; and as\nsuch, he did not have to disclose his bankruptcy filing.  He also testified, credibly, that he misread\nthe questions as to his past delinquencies.  When he filled out his subsequent QNSP, he corrected\nhis prior mistakes.  The Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness is attested to by those who know him and served\nwith him in Afghanistan.  Guideline E is also found for the Applicant.\nAs to his alleged Foreign Influence, the Applicant's two sibling brothers are citizens of and\nreside in Afghanistan.  The first disqualifying condition is therefore applicable as \"[a]n immediate\nfamily member . . . is a citizen of a foreign country.\"  This is countered, however, by the first\nmitigating condition, as there is no evidence that their presence in Afghanistan can \"be exploited by\na foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)\ninvolved and the United States.\"  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant\nwould even consider any such attempt at exploitation.  Furthermore, the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and the circumstances, as set forth above, including the virtually non-existent potential for\nexploitation, still warrants a favorable finding under the whole person standard.  Mitigation is again\nshown.  Guideline B is  found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nFinancial Considerations, his Personal Conduct and his Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus\nmet the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B, E and F, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B, E and F.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Financial\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nd.   For the Applicant.\ne.   For the Applicant.\nf.   For the Applicant.\ng.   For the Applicant.\nh.   For the Applicant.\ni.

In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following findings of facts. Applicant is an unmarried 29-year-old woman.

Those family members\u2019 entries into the U.S. were sponsored by Applicant\u2019s paternal grandmother who was herself a naturalized U.S. citizen. Because Applicant\u2019s older sister was 21 years old and no longer considered dependent on her father, the grandmother could not sponsor her entry into the U.S. Thus, Applicant\u2019s mother and older sister remained in Burma until such time as their entry could be sponsored by Applicant\u2019s father. Applicant\u2019s mother immigrated to the U.S. in 2002, now has permanent resident alien status, and is awaiting the time when she will be eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. Applicant\u2019s sister first went to England, but now has immigrated to the U.S., attained permanent resident alien status, and is awaiting the time when she will be eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. Applicant graduated from high school in Burma in 1994, and immediately began studies at a medical school.

Clearance is granted.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as\n1\namended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 1, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on August 29, 2006, admitted all SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on October 13, 2006, and reassigned\nto me on October 31, 2006, to be conducted with other hearings I had scheduled in the same region.\nA notice of hearing was issued on November 1, 2006, scheduling the hearing for November 30,\n2006. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. \nThe government submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1-7. GE 1-3 were admitted into the record and administrative notice was taken of the\nrelevant information contained in GE 4-7 without objection. Applicant testified and submitted three\ndocumentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-3, and admitted into the\nrecord without objection.

In addition, after a\nthorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following findings of facts.\nApplicant is an unmarried 29-year-old woman. She was born in Burma and immigrated to\nthe United States with her father and brother in 1998 when she was 20 years old. Those family\nmembers\u2019 entries into the U.S. were sponsored by Applicant\u2019s paternal grandmother who was herself\na naturalized U.S. citizen. Because Applicant\u2019s older sister was 21 years old and no longer\nconsidered dependent on her father, the grandmother could not sponsor her entry into the U.S. Thus,\nApplicant\u2019s mother and older sister remained in Burma until such time as their entry could be\nsponsored by Applicant\u2019s father. Applicant\u2019s mother immigrated to the U.S. in 2002, now has\npermanent resident alien status, and is awaiting the time when she will be eligible to apply for U.S.\ncitizenship. Applicant\u2019s sister first went to England, but now has immigrated to the U.S., attained\npermanent resident alien status, and is awaiting the time when she will be eligible to apply for U.S.\ncitizenship.\nApplicant graduated from high school in Burma in 1994, and immediately began studies at\na medical school. Following her move to the U.S., she began studies at a major public university in\n1998, and obtained a bachelor of science degree in computer science in May 2002. She was hired\nas an software engineer associate by a defense contractor in June 2003. She has since been promoted\n\n3\nto senior software engineer and earns approximately $73,000 annually. She rents an apartment for\nherself, but in 2004 purchased a house for her parents. She applied about $27,000 she had\naccumulated in savings to the $135,000 purchase price of the house. Applicant does not own any\nproperty in Burma.\nApplicant\u2019s mother was a self-employed physician in Burma. She has not worked outside the\nhome since coming to the United States. Applicant\u2019s father worked as a factory manager in Burma\nuntil he quit that job in about 1989, and thereafter stayed home with the children. Applicant\u2019s sister\nis 30 years old, worked as a physician in Burma, and is now completing her medical residency at a\nprivate U.S. medical center. Applicant\u2019s brother is 26 years old, completed his college education at\na major U.S. public university, and is employed as a computer engineer by a U.S. company.\nApplicant traveled to Burma in December 2000 to visit her mother and sister who were still\nresident there. She used a Burmese passport for that travel because she was still a Burmese citizen.\nThat passport expired in 2001, has not been renewed, and cannot be located. \nApplicant traveled to Burma in January 2005 with her boyfriend to vacation and attend a\nseven-year memorial service for her deceased grandmother. Having become a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in May 2003, and having acquired a U.S. passport that same month, Applicant used her U.S.\npassport for that travel. Before traveling to Burma in 2005, Applicant notified her employer\u2019s\nsecurity office of her intended travel. She also checked in with the U.S. Embassy in Burma upon\narrival in that country. She did not have any contact with Burmese government officials on either\noccasion.\nApplicant\u2019s is engaged to be married to the boyfriend she vacationed with in Burma in 2005.\nHe is also a naturalized citizen of the U.S., having emigrated from Burma in the mid-1990s. Until\nthe 2005 trip to Burma with her, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 had not returned to that country since\nimmigrating to the U.S. He does not have any contact with anyone in Burma.  \nApplicant has a maternal aunt and two maternal uncles who are citizens and residents of\nBurma. She visited with those relatives while in Burma in 2000 and 2005. She has telephone contact\nwith those relatives about once a month when she calls them so her mother can speak with her\nsiblings. Applicant never called her aunt or uncles before her mother immigrated to the U.S., and\nnever contacts them now other than to arrange for her mother to speak with them.\nApplicant has six cousins who are citizens and residents of Burma. She never contacts those\npeople and only speaks with them if they happen to be present when she calls her aunt or uncles.\nApplicant had three friends who were citizens and residents of Burma when she was interviewed by\nan investigator from the Office of Personnel Management in January 2006. One of those friends is\nnow a permanent resident alien in the U.S., and another is a student in Singapore who has no\nintention of ever returning to reside in Burma. Applicant visited with the third friend during her trip\nto Burma in 2005, but has had no contact with her since then other than to exchange greeting cards.\nSenior engineering managers with Applicant\u2019s employer who she has worked for wrote\nletters of recommendation on her behalf. Those individuals consider her to be an extremely diligent\nand model engineer. She has established a reputation at work for being hardworking, conscientious,\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n8\n4\nand dependable. They note her care in handling classified material and security awareness and\nrecommend most strongly that she be granted access to classified information. \n      \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and\nMitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the\nDirective. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline\nB, pertaining to foreign influence with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government has\n2\nthe burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\n3\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence,  although the government is required to present\n4\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\n5\nless than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden\n6\nshifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the\ncase against him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n7\nfavorable clearance decision.8\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n5\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n9\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n10\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence.  A security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence,\nor obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could\ncreate the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also\nrelevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure.\nThe record evidence clearly establishes that Applicant does not have close ties of affection\nor obligation to anyone in Burma. Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are either citizens and\nresidents or permanent residents of the United States. The only family members she has who are\ncitizens and residents of Burma are an aunt, two uncles, and six cousins. Although she visited with\nthem on the trips she took to Burma in 2000 and 2005, the only continuing contact she has with any\nof those relatives is when she calls her aunt or uncles to arrange telephone conversations between\nthem and her mother. Two of the three friends alleged in the SOR no longer reside in Burma, and\nApplicant has not had any contact with the third since she visited Burma in January 2005, other than\nan exchange of greeting cards.    \nNo Disqualifying Condition applies to the facts of this case. Further, whatever minimal ties\nof affection or obligation that could be deemed to apply to Applicant\u2019s relatives and friends in Burma\nare overwhelming outweighed by application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 3: Contact and\ncorrespondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\nrecognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be\nadjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound\njudgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. I am satisfied Applicant has presented sufficient\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome the case against her. Accordingly,\nGuideline  B is decided for Applicant.  \n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline B:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs a-c:\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  However, the\n1\ngovernment requested a hearing, and on October 31,  2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge\nElizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred with respect to a\nfinding; whether the Judge was biased; and whether the Judge erred by  concluding that the security\nconcerns raised under Guidelines E and J had not been mitigated.\n(1) Applicant argues that: \u201cThe Administrative Judge err[ed] by describing the DUI in 1996\nas \u2018driving drunk.\u2019  While this term may be acceptable in the vernacular, it is not a correct legal\ndescription of the offense charged and exhibits bias on the part of the judge in this context.\u201d   The\n2\nBoard does not find this argument persuasive.    \nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  The Board does not review a case de novo.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the\nBoard concludes that the Judge\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence and is sustainable.\nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was\nbiased or prejudiced against Applicant.  Rather, the issue is whether the record contains any\nindication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness\nand impartiality of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).\nBias or prejudice is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached\nunfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0954 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 1995).\nMoreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error, standing\nalone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudiced.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0515\nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 1999).  Applicant has not met his heavy burden of persuasion on this issue,\nmerely because the Judge referred to Applicant\u2019s 1996 DUI as \u201cdriving drunk.\u201d  Moreover,\nApplicant fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a\nreasonable person to question the fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge. See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2 (App. Bd. June 6, 2006). \n\nId at 4.\n3\nBecause the Board finds no error with respect to the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions under Guidelines J and E,\n4\nit need not address Applicant\u2019s additional request that the Board recommend to the Director, DOHA that he waive\napplication of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, which admittedly applies in this case.  In any event, there is no provision for waiver\nrecommendations by Judges or others.  See DOHA Operating Instruction 64, as revised, Sept. 12, 2006 (\u201c. . . the\nAdministrative Judge shall not opine whether a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 is merited, nor recommend whether to consider\nthe case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986\").  Only the Director, DOHA or his designee has the authority to grant waivers\nin meritorious case. See \u201cImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Dec. 29, 2005).\u201d \n3\n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge should have concluded, as a matter of law, that\nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct under Guideline J was extenuated or mitigated because the\nconduct was an isolated incident; it was not recent; it was not likely to recur; it would not subject\nApplicant to coercion; and Applicant has subsequently demonstrated rehabilitation.  Applicant\nargues that the Judge should have concluded, as a matter of law, that Applicant\u2019s disqualifying\nconduct under Guideline E was extenuated or mitigated because \u201cit is an impermissible stretch to\nconsider [Applicant\u2019s] one-time failure to disclose his criminal record as a violation of Guideline\nE.\u201d  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.\n3\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\n \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence against the nature and seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions\nand whole person factors. The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence presented in mitigation\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The favorable record evidence\ncited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record\nthat was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J\nis sustainable.4\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Finding no error, we affirm.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is a senior software engineer for\na defense contractor.  In March 2003, while working late at his work site, Applicant \u201cexperimented\u201d\nwith a memory card transfer procedure on a classified computer.

The computer indicated that an unapproved device had been hooked into it and that the\nadministrator should reboot.  Subsequent investigation disclosed Applicant\u2019s activities in accessing\nthe classified computer system.  Forensic analysis confirmed that none of the files Applicant\ndownloaded were classified.\nApplicant had been previously briefed on his employer\u2019s security policy and NISPOM\nprocedures, including downloading procedures.  Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to follow established\nprocedures resulted in his being suspended without pay for one week.  Applicant received security\nrefresher training.  Applicant has had no prior security incidents or violations.  Applicant is highly\nskilled and successful, credited by his employer as \u201ca model employee since the incident with proven\nintegrity and trust in administering classified systems.\u201d  Decision at 5.\nB.  Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nDepartment Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s use of the term \u201cexperimental\u201d in characterizing\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct.  Department Counsel argues that this term minimizes the seriousness of\nApplicant\u2019s security violation, as reflected in the record evidence.  We have examined the evidence\nas a whole, however, and conclude that the Judge\u2019s use of the word is simply an evaluative\njudgement drawn from Applicant\u2019s testimony and from the exhibits supplied by the Government.\nWe find no basis to question the proposition that Applicant downloaded the files in order to see if\nit could be done.  See, e.g., Gov\u2019t. Ex. 2 at 1.  The word \u201cexperiment\u201d is another way of expressing\nthe same thing.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s use of that word in his findings.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion. In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the\nBoard will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive,\nor other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nWe acknowledge that a security violation is a serious matter.  Indeed, a person who\ndeliberately violates security rules has breached a fiduciary duty to the United States.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 97-0435 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998).  In the case sub judice the issue is not whether\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct is serious, however, but whether the Judge erred in finding it sufficiently\nmitigated to justify granting him a security clearance.\n\nDirective \u00b6  E2.A11.1.3.2.\n1\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.4.\n2\nSee Directive \u00b6  E2.2.1 for discussion of whole person factors.  Among those listed are \u201cfrequency and recency\n3\nof the conduct\u201d(\u00b6 E2.2.1.3); \u201cpresence or absence of rehabilitation\u201d (\u00b6 E2.2.1.6); \u201cmotivation for the conduct\u201d (\u00b6\nE2.2.1.7); and the \u201clikelihood of continuation or recurrence\u201d (\u00b6 E2.2.1.9).  \n4\nThe Judge concluded that two mitigating conditions operated to Applicant\u2019s benefit: that the\nsecurity violation was isolated or infrequent  and that Applicant had demonstrated \u201ca positive\n1\nattitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d   The Judge stated, \u201cApplicant has\n2\nexhibited remorse and renewed understanding about the importance of protecting classified\ninformation in his custody and control.  His avoidance of any other security violations, his\ncontributions to his employer, and his exhibited attitudinal changes are noted.  Based on his\notherwise good track record for protecting classified information, his expressed remorse, and his\navoidance of any recurrent violations in over two years...Applicant carries his evidentiary burden in\ndemonstrating he mitigated the security concerns raised\u201d in the SOR.  Decision at 8.\nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s analysis and find it to be rationally connected with his\nfindings.  In addition, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s analysis is broadly congruent with the record\nevidence as a whole.  We note Applicant\u2019s explanation for his motive in downloading the files, that\nof attempting to broaden his understanding of computer technology.  Tr. at 32.  That Applicant\u2019s\nstated motive was benign is a factor that weighs in his favor when evaluating the whole person.   We\n3\nalso note that his admissions that he exercised poor judgement support the Judge\u2019s conclusion as to\nApplicant\u2019s attitude toward his security responsibilities.  Tr. at 31, 42.  All in all we conclude that\nthe Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin          \nJean E. Smallin\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E. Moody          \nJames E. Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDISSENTING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE MICHAEL Y. RA\u2019ANAN\n\n5\nI cannot concur with the majority.  The Judge found that Applicant, a senior software\nengineer with a defense contractor, had eleven years active duty experience with the Air Force and\nhad regularly serviced classified computer systems.  Two and a half years prior to the hearing,\nApplicant, working late at night, experimented on two other people\u2019s computers in order to access\na classified system and download files to a personal device..  He then transferred the downloaded\nfiles to a second personal device.  He then went home with the two personal devices.  The Judge\ncorrectly identifies this conduct as a deliberate security violation.\nThe Judge concluded that the deliberate security violation was mitigated.  I cannot affirm that\nconclusion.  Applicant was well-informed that what he was doing was prohibited.  The fact that he\ndid it late at night, and on other people\u2019s computers demonstrates that he engaged in the prohibited\nconduct in the most surreptitious fashion he could devise, in order to cover his tracks.  If no\nclassified information was actually compromised, that is only matter of good fortune.  In the Board\u2019s\nfirst decision in this case we noted that:\n\u201cSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access\nto classified information, as they raise very serious questions about an applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information.. Once it is established that Applicant has committed a\nsecurity violation, he has \u201ca very heavy burden of demonstrating that [he] should be entrusted\nwith classified information. Because security violations strike at the very heart of the\nindustrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any claims of reform and\nrehabilitation strict scrutiny.\u201d In many security clearance cases, applicants are denied a\nclearance for having an indicator of a risk that they might commit a security violation (e.g.,\nalcohol abuse, delinquent debts or drug use). Here the issue is not merely an indicator, rather\nthe Judge found Applicant disregarded in-place security procedures in violation of the\nNISPOM.\u201d (Citations omitted).ISCR Case No. 04-04264 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 8, 2006).\nThe Judge\u2019s decision in this case does not demonstrate that Applicant has met the \u201cvery\nheavy burden\u201d of demonstrating he should be entrusted with classified information.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Michael Lyles, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nThis 30-year-old software designer retains significant close ties to family members in  his\nnative South Korea.  Applicant came to the U.S. in the early 1990s, and became a U.S. citizen in\nOctober 2002.  Despite his long residence in the U.S., he retains close ties to South Korea,\nspecifically close family members.  On balance, he has not adequately mitigated the risks indicated\nby the Government\u2019s evidence.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 26, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn February 23, 2006  and March 23, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth\nin the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the basis of\nthe written record; i.e., without a hearing. On August 11, 2006, Department Counsel issued a File\nof Relevant Material (FORM).  Applicant was instructed that any response to the FORM was due\nwithin 30 days of receipt.  In this case any response was due by September 16, 2006.  Applicant filed\na timely response. The matter was assigned to me for decision on September 20, 2006. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 29-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor.  The SOR contains\nseven (7) allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant admits all seven allegations.\nAll admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. After considering the\ntotality of the evidence, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status of each SOR\nallegation.\nApplicant came to the United States in 1991, at age14, to live with his mother, who had come\nin 1987.  Applicant considers himself to be assimilated into American society and has no cultural\nties to South Korea. \n1.a.  Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of South Korea.  Applicant calls him about\nonce a month.  He works for a moving company. \n1.b.  As of January 2004, his sister was a citizen and resident of South Korea.  She was\ncompleting school and he expected her to return to the U.S., and become a citizen.\n1.c.  His grandmother is a citizen and resident of South Korea. \n\n3\n1.d.  His aunt and uncle are citizens and residents of South Korea. As of January 2004, she\nwas in the U.S., learning English, and accompanied by her two children (Item 7 at page 3). She\nintended to return to South Korea, but there is no evidence she had done so.  \n1.e.  His cousin is a citizen and resident of South Korea.  As of January 2004, he was a\nstudent.  They were in contact once or twice a month by internet. \n1.f.  Applicant no longer maintains a relationship with his with three friends who are all\ncitizens and residents of South Korea.\n1.g.  Applicant traveled to South Korea in at least 1999/2000, 2001, and 2003.  The first trip\nwas to visit an ill grandmother in Seoul (18 days).  The second was a visit to his family in Seoul\n(three weeks), and the last  trip (three weeks) was with his South Korean-born,  naturalized American\nfiancee.  They visited with both their families in the Seoul area.  They also visited friends and his\nfamily\u2019s cemetery.  The first two trips were paid for by his parents and he paid for the third trip.\nApplicant does not consider himself close to his father or other foreign relatives and friends (Item\n7).  He \u201crarely communicates with his father and grandmother in South Korea\u201d (Response to\nFORM).  Overall, however, the evidence compels the conclusion that Applicant does have close ties\nof affection and obligation to individuals who are citizens of and reside in a foreign country, to wit,\nSouth Korea. \nApplicant does not consider himself to be a dual citizen with South Korea and has taken steps\nto formally renounce his South Korean citizenship and surrender his South Korean passport.  He has\nno personal foreign financial assets, investments, or interests.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a South Korean-born, naturalized U.S. citizens.  She, too, has family in\nSouth Korea.  \nApplicant understands his security obligations to the United States, He avers he is not\nsusceptible to improper contacts by any source (Item 4). \nPOLICIES\nEach adjudicative decision must include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all\ncases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all\nnine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\n\n4\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  In  his response to the SOR,\nApplicant admits all of the allegations.  In his response to the FORM,  Applicant adds what he\nconsiders to be mitigating information.\nApplicant came to the United States at age 14 and is now 29.  He grew up in American\nsociety and considers himself to be an American only.  There is nothing in the record to suggest\notherwise.  At the same time, as the FORM documents, Applicant has longstanding and close ties\nto South Korea through a variety of relatives, both his and his fiancee\u2019s and those in the U.S. and\nSouth Korea.  There is no question of Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the Unite States, but there is also no\nquestion that the potential exists that Applicant may be placed in a position where he may be forced\nto choose between his affection for the United States and his affection for his relatives, if not directly\nfor South Korea.  \nDisqualifying and Mitigating Conditions - The Concern: A security risk may exist when an\nindividual\u2019s immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be\nbound by ties of affection, influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States, or may be\nsubject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result\nin the compromise of classified information.  Contact with citizens of other countries are also\nrelevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure.\nDisqualifying Condition (DC): (1) An immediate family member, or a person to whom the\nindividual has close ties of affection, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country; DC\n2 Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the\npotential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists; \nMitigating Conditions (MC): None are clearly established by the evidence of record.  Under\n\n5\nMC (1) It has not been clearly shown that all of the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father,\nmother, brothers, sisters, cohabitant, or associate(s) in question), are not agents of a foreign power\nor in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose\nbetween loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.  Under MC 3 contact with some of\nthe individuals in the foreign country remain close, while others have become casual and infrequent.\nHis relationship with his family remains \u201cclose,\u201d as that term is used in the Directive.    \nSouth Korea is generally recognized as an ally and friend of the United States (Items I, II, and\nIII).  At the same time, the U.S. Government is concerned about South Korea\u2019s significant\ninvolvement in economic espionage in the U.S. (Item IV). \nPleadings from a 1997 criminal case, U.S. v. Kim [not related] (Item V) show that such\nespionage has occurred.  That case does not mean that Applicant will act improperly, but it does\nsuggest that a higher risk exists that he may be asked to act improperly than if the other country was\none that was not recognized as an active collector of economic espionage.  DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board,\nin ISCR Case No. 98-0592 at 3 (May 4, 1999), recognizes that \u201ceven countries friendly to the United\nStates can attempt to gain access to classified information.\u201d  \nI have carefully considered the Government\u2019s evaluation of the evidence and the application\nof that evidence to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions found in the Foreign Influence\nguidelines (FORM at 5-10).  Based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that \u201cApplicant\u2019s\ncontact with foreign nationals is regular, sustained, and bolstered by affection\u201d (FORM at 12).  As\nwith all applicants for a security clearance, the burden is on Applicant to demonstrate the absence\nof significant risk.  He has not done so and, accordingly, I am unable to conclude that Applicant has\ndemonstrated that he possesses the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of\nanyone seeking access to the nation\u2019s secrets. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.e.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nFor the Applicant\n           Subparagraph  l.g.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\n\n6\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: David P. Price, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nOn October 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 17, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing through counsel on November 26, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on December 27,\n2007. I received the case assignment on January 4, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a delay until February 2008, in order for his counsel to be available. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on January 17, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nFebruary 13, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 6 which were\nMarch 7, 2008\n\nTr. 45.\n1\nAE C (Awards and Certificates 1-21).\n2\nThere are different months and years in several documents for this marriage. At the hearing, Applicant\n3\nstated January 22, 1981.\nAE B\n4\nAE B (Final Decree of Divorce).\n5\nOne document states August 30 not August 24.\n6\nTr. 75.\n7\n2\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\nA through E, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nFebruary 22, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 17, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduating\nfrom high school in 1975, he attended college on scholarships for several years. He\njoined the U.S. Navy in 1978 and retired as a chief warrant officer in 2000. During his\nmilitary service he held a security clearance.1\nWhile in the Navy, he received numerous awards, medals, commendations, and\ncertificates. He was a superb seaman and mechanic. He earned the respect of junior\nand senior leadership. He was highly recommended for any position of leadership.2\nApplicant married his first wife in January 1981  and believed he was divorced on\n3\nAugust 13, 1992. The hearing for the divorce was July 30, 1992.  However, the divorce\n4\ndecree was not actually signed until September 9, 1992. This created many problems\nfor Applicant.  \n5\nOn August 24, 1992,  Applicant married a second time. He called his divorce\n6\nattorney to see if the divorce was final. Applicant asserts that he was told \u201cyes\u201d that he\nwas divorced. However, unbeknownst to him, he was not officially divorced from his first\nwife.  Applicant had a difficult and tumultuous second marriage. His second wife filed for\n7\ndivorce in 1999. At that time, Applicant was preparing to retire from the Navy. In fact, he\nretired in 2000. \n\nTr. 104.\n8\nTR. 109.\n9\nGE 2 (Security Application 2003).\n10\n3\nApplicant was preparing to marry his third wife. He married her on September 18,\n1999. During this time, Applicant had to process many retirement papers, including\ninformation on dependents and beneficiaries. He needed to produce divorce decrees,\nand other documents. It was during this time that he learned that the second marriage\nwas not vaild (void ab inititio) because he married before he was actually divorced from\nhis first wife. His attorney then told him he needed to get a decree of annulment or have\nthe second marriage declared void. The Navy required this documentation to proceed\nwith the retirement process. Applicant decided after a time to forge a signature on the\nannulment paperwork. He signed the name of the state judge and then submitted the\npaper to the Navy - the date on that decree was September 10, 1999.\nApplicant\u2019s second wife was not happy with the annulment. She initiated a civil\nsuit against Applicant. She learned that she would have no dependent benefits and\nalerted the Navy. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) investigated\nApplicant for possible fraud, forgery, bigamy and orders violations charges.  Applicant\n8\nreceived no punishment from the Navy and retired on February 1, 2000.\nIn February 2001, Applicant completed a security clearance application. During\nthe investigation, Applicant learned that the FBI report indicated that he had an arrest\nfor forgery in January 2000.  He did not take the job with the agency because he was\n9\noffered another position with a government contractor.\nIn 2003, Applicant completed another security clearance application. He\ncommented on the form about the incident in January 2000.  Applicant started his\n10\ncurrent employment in February 2000 and has a security clearance. He has completed\nseveral important projects for the company.\nApplicant\u2019s current position is a challenging and demanding one. His colleagues\nand supervisors applaud him for his leadership and his integrity. He is open, honest,\nand loves his job. He receives high praise from his current employer.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n5\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying; including:\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the persons\u2019\nprofessional, or community standing.\n             The Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s misconduct in\nDecember 1999. He submitted an annulment decree to the Navy with a forged signature\nof a state judge. His submission of a false document is a violation of the Uniform Military\nJustice Code (UCMJ). He admitted that he signed the name of a judicial official on the\nannulment decree so that he could complete the required paperwork for the retirement\nprocess. Thus, I find his action alleged in SOR \u00b61 establishes \u00b616(b) and 16(e).\nParagraph 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthful;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n\n6\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nApplicant has admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1. The offense is not minor.\nHe signed the name of a state judge on an official document and submitted it to the\nNavy. The offense has not recurred, and Applicant now recognizes the security and\nemployment impact of such conduct. It does not cast doubt on his current  reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment because it is unlikely to recur. Applicant has\n\u201cacknowledged the behavior\u201d and recognized the negative consequences of such\nconduct. Based primarily on the lack of misconduct after 1999, I conclude he has\nmatured and such behavior is unlikely to recur. Finally, he has reduced or eliminated\n\u201cvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d by not  He expressed remorse for\nthis misconduct and presented character evidence to establish that this misconduct was\nout of character. Thus, \u00b6 17(c) is applicable. \u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) are partially applicable.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraphs 31(a) and 31(c) set forth two conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d\nand \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nThe offense, as listed in SOR 2.a (submission of a false document constitutes a\nviolation of the UCMJ. The fact that Applicant was not disciplined nor were charges or\nconviction resulted is not dispositive under paragraph 31(c), which notes a possible\nsecurity concern without formal prosecution of the offense. I therefore conclude that\nparagraph 31(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.a.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\n\n7\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) apply. There is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including the\npassage of about nine years. He expressed remorse. He has an outstanding\nemployment record, military service and a great recommendation from his current\nemployer. Applicant has had a security clearance for almost 30 years. His post-offense\nbehavior is sufficient to fully mitigate the act of misconduct in this case. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s military personal\nmisconduct in December 1999. He submitted an annulment decree to the Navy with a\nforged signature of a state judge. His submission of a false document is a violation of\nthe UCMJ. He admitted that he signed the name of a judicial official on the annulment\ndecree so that he could complete the required paperwork for the retirement process.\nThus, I find his action alleged in SOR \u00b6 16(b) and 16(e).\n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served more than 20\nyears in the U.S. Navy garnering many awards and citations. He has an outstanding\nemployment record and maintained a security clearance for many years. He is praised\n\n8\nfor his trustworthiness and leadership skills. He is now working overseas for a defense\ncontractor and received high praise for his work. He has many character references\nfrom retired military personnel.\nApplicant regrets submitting a false document. He has no other misconduct or\noffense since that time. He has been recommended for a security clearance by those\nknowledgeable in the field. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and review of him as a whole person, I\nfind in his favor. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as\nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct\nand criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 62-year-old electrical engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Background Applicant was born in Czechoslovakia to a Czech mother and Russian father. He never met his father, who served in the Russian military and was shipped back to Russia shortly after he married Applicant\u2019s mother in 1946 (see ex. 5). Applicant was raised by his mother in Czechoslovakia. Russian authorities presented his mother with divorce papers in 1953 and threatened to ship her to Russia if she did not sign them (ex. 5). Under duress, she signed the divorce papers as instructed. With the Communist 4 Party\u2019s seizure of Czechoslovakia in 1948, Applicant was raised in a country that was subject to the controlling influence of the Soviet Union. Applicant enjoyed a relatively normal childhood and graduated from high school in 1964 (see exs. 1 and 11). While a young school boy, Applicant recognized that he had superior soccer skills and began playing the sport in organized junior leagues. By the time he was 15, he was playing soccer at a level he considered to be more than professional (viz., paid by his company). He played soccer throughout high school and graduated from high school at the age of 19 (Tr. 113). After graduating from high school, Applicant was conscripted into the Czech army and achieved the rank of ser",

Roberts, Esquire\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992,  issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\ndetermination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 20, 2009, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 25, 2009. The case was scheduled for hearing on\nAugust 18, 2009.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or\ndeny Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of 11 exhibits (exs. 1-11); Applicant relied on seven witnesses (including\nJanuary 29, 2010\n\n2\nhimself) and 23 exhibits (exs. A-W).  The transcript (Tr.) was received August 25, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nBesides its 11 exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of two  \ndocuments: Background Note: Czech Republic, U.S. Department of State (July 2008)\nand Country Specific Information, Czech Republic, U.S. Department of State (February\n2009).  \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007).  Administrative notice is appropriate\nfor noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice\nwas granted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the\ngeopolitical situation in the Czech Republic.  Administrative notice was extended to the\ndocuments themselves, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.\nThis notice did not foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of\nthe information contained in the reports addressing the Czech Republic\u2019s current status.\nAdditionally, I have taken administrative notice, sua sponte, of the following\ndocument: 2009 Investment Climate-Czech Republic, U.S. Department of State\n(February 2009).  This document is covered by the same administrative notice\nprocedures as the previous documents, for which administrative notice was taken.\n-\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant asked for additional time to supplement\nthe record with translation certifications.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted\nseven days to supplement the record. The Government was afforded three days to\nrespond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with translation\ncertifications and a letter from his facility security officer (FSO) accepting Applicant\u2019s\nsurrender of his Czech Republic passport with reservations. The submissions are\naccepted as Applicant\u2019s exhibits X through Z.   \nBy agreement, both parties were afforded time (to September 10, 2009) to file\nclosing written briefs.  Within the time permitted, each party filed a closing legal\nmemorandum for consideration of the merits. Both closings were accepted and\nconsidered.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline C, it is alleged that Applicant: (1)  exercised dual citizenship with\nthe Czech Republic and the United States; (2) applied for and was granted Czech\nRepublic citizenship and issued a Czech Republic passport in about 2003, even though,\nhe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in about 1977; and (3) disclosed his possession of\n\n3\na Czech passport, issued in July 2003 and not to expire until July 2013, in a January\n2009 answer to a DOHA interrogatory.\nUnder Guideline B, it is alleged that Applicant (a) has a spouse (married in 1984)\nwho is a citizen of the Czech Republic; (b) owns property in the Czech Republic; (c)\nhave two brothers who are citizens and residents of the Czech Republic; (c) has a\nsister-in-law who is a citizen and resident of the Czech Republic; (d) maintains a bank\naccount in the Czech Republic; and (e) traveled to the Czech Republic in 2003 and\n2007.\nUnder Guideline E, it is alleged that Applicant (a) informed others in 1972 that he\nhad served in the Czechoslovakia army and trained North Vietnamese soldiers; (b)\nsubmitted a reimbursement request for official travel reimbursement totaling $1,340 and\nlater attempted to resign from federal government service following his interrogation by\na special agent from the Naval Investigative Service regarding his falsification of his\ntravel claim; (c) was denied a security clearance in May 1986 due to the presence of\nrelatives in Czechoslovakia, and ultimately was terminated from federal service; (d)\nfalsified the SF-171 he executed in September 1985, by omitting his separation from\nemployment in 1983; (e) failed to report a contact with a suspected Czech intelligence\nagent when he was interviewed by a special agent for the Defense Security Service\n(DSS) in 1985 and 1987; (f) obtained Czech Republic citizenship and a Czech passport\nafter obtaining a DoD top secret clearance in 1997; and (g) failed to report to\nappropriate personnel that he obtained Czech citizenship in 2003, in violation of\nparagraph 1.302c of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual\n(NISPOM) of January 1995, as amended.   \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations without any\nexplanations.  He denied having a sister-in-law who is a citizen and resident of the\nCzech Republic, and he denied his failing to report a suspected Czech intelligence\nagent to DSS investigators when questioned in 1985 and 1987. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 62-year-old electrical engineer for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant was born in Czechoslovakia to a Czech mother and Russian father.\nHe never met his father, who served in the Russian military and was shipped back to\nRussia shortly after he married Applicant\u2019s mother in 1946 (see ex. 5).  Applicant was\nraised by his mother in Czechoslovakia.  Russian authorities presented his mother with\ndivorce papers in 1953 and threatened to ship her to Russia if she did not sign them\n(ex. 5). Under duress, she signed the divorce papers as instructed. With the Communist\n\n4\nParty\u2019s seizure of Czechoslovakia in 1948, Applicant was raised in a country that was\nsubject to the controlling influence of the Soviet Union.  \nApplicant enjoyed a relatively normal childhood and graduated from high school\nin 1964 (see exs. 1 and 11). While a young school boy, Applicant recognized that he\nhad superior soccer skills and began playing the sport in organized junior leagues.  By\nthe time he was 15, he was playing soccer at a level he considered to be more than\nprofessional (viz., paid by his company).  He played soccer throughout high school and\ngraduated from high school at the age of 19 (Tr. 113). \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant was conscripted into the Czech\narmy and achieved the rank of sergeant during his three-year service tenure.  While in\nthe Czech army he was never assigned to duties outside of Czechoslovakia, and was\nnever involved in any military training exercises (see ex. 7).  He combined his work in\nthe electronics department of a railroad system with organized soccer (ex. 7; Tr. 114-\n15).  As the result of his recognized superior soccer skills, he was assigned to the\ncountry\u2019s national soccer team (see ex.; Tr. 115).  He was discharged from the Czech\nmilitary in 1967 (see ex. 5).\nIn 1969, while traveling with his national Czech soccer team in Yugoslavia,\nApplicant defected (see ex. 5; Tr.115).  He chose to settle in Germany where he\npursued a contract to play soccer for a German team (Tr. 115-16).  After playing soccer\nfor a year in Germany, he was banned from playing professional soccer because of an\nangry outburst from the Czechs over his fleeing Czechoslovakia (Tr. 116). After\ndeclining multiple offers to come to the United States to play professional soccer,\nApplicant accepted an offer from a U.S. team to come and play for a U.S. soccer team\n(Tr. 116).  \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in May 1970.  Following his defection,\nhe separated from his wife, and divorced her in 1972 (see exs. 5 and 11).  She claimed\nhe fathered her child before their 1969 separation (ex. 5).  After many years of paternity\ndenial, he accepted his wife\u2019s child as his daughter in 1977 and mailed support\npayments to his ex-wife for many years (ex. 5).  \nApplicant applied for U.S. citizenship, and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in\nMarch 1977 (see exs. 1 and 2).  Once in the United States, he worked for several\ncivilian companies pending his application for U.S. citizenship. After becoming a U.S.\ncitizen, he applied to the Czechoslovakian government for renunciation of his\nCzechoslovakian citizenship  (Tr. 138).  Czech officials informed him that when he\nbecame a U.S. citizen, he automatically lost his Czechoslovakian citizenship (see ex.\nW; Tr. 137-39).\nAfter becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant entered a respected U.S. university and\npursued a curriculum in electrical engineering.  Upon transferring to another accredited\nuniversity in 1979, he earned an electrical engineering degree in 1982 (see exs. 3 and\n4).  \n\n5\nIn 1984, Applicant married a Czech citizen; he has one child (a son) from this\nmarriage (see exs. 5 and 11).  Their son is 25 years of age and resides with Applicant\nand his wife (Tr. 214).  Applicant adopted his wife\u2019s two children. They are adults and\nreside in other states within the United States (Tr. 175).  Like Applicant, his children\nbecame dual citizens of the United States and the Czech Republic (Tr. 174-76).  They\neach possess a Czech passport in addition to their respective U.S. passports.  His wife\nand children have traveled back and forth to the Czech Republic almost every year (Tr.\n189).  His children, though, do not travel anymore (Tr. 191).  \nApplicant\u2019s wife retains her Czech citizenship. She remains a very patriotic\nCzech, and did not emigrate to the United States to become a U.S. citizen, but to be\nwith Applicant  (Tr. 169).  Fearful for the safety of Applicant (in Applicant\u2019s view), she\nnever applied for U.S. citizenship (Tr. 168-69). She intends to return to the Czech\nRepublic to live when circumstances permit. His wife is currently employed in the United\nStates as a sales representative for a U.S. company and makes between $10 and $11\nan hour (Tr. 170). She is trained as an economist and worked in that field in\nCzechoslovakia.\nApplicant has two half-brothers who are citizens and residents of the Czech\nRepublic. His youngest half-brother (age 59) owns a security service that provides\nguards for factories.  He is independently wealthy and requires no financial assistance\nfrom Applicant (Tr. 185).  His oldest half-brother (almost 60) works in electronics, and is\nvery poor (Tr. 181-84).  Applicant provides some financial assistance to this half-brother\nby giving him all of his sportswear clothing, which his brother, in turn, sells for a profit\n(exploiting Applicant\u2019s celebrity status).  \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law (previously a citizen and resident of the Czech Republic)\nrecently expired (Tr. 129, 147).  Before she passed away, she maintained periodic\ncontact with Applicant\u2019s wife.\nSince becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has worked for a variety of employers in\nthe public and private sectors (see exs. 1, 3, and 4).  Beginning in May 1982, he worked\nfor the U.S. Air Force in a civilian capacity as an engineer (see ex. 2). \nAfter a brief period of unemployment between June 1983 and January 1984,\nApplicant went to work for the Navy in a civilian role.  Records show that he resigned\nfrom his Navy position in June 1984 to avoid adverse action against him (see ex. 11).\nHis employer charged him with claiming false expenses in excess of $1,000 (ex. 11).\nWhen later confronted with the charges by a Coast Guard investigator (investigating his\nCoast Guard clearance application), records indicate he admitted to making\nunauthorized overseas calls and filing improper travel claims.  Coast Guard records\nindicate he agreed to make restitution (ex. 11). \nIn his 1987 DSS interview, Applicant assured that he never accepted the Navy\u2019s\ntermination reasons and later denied falsifying travel expense forms, and resigning his\nNavy position under threat of adverse personnel action (see ex. 6; Tr. 128).  However,\n\n1\n   The law offering the opportunity to former Czech citizens to reacquire their Czech citizenship is identified\nin exhibit U as Law #193/1999.  This law expressly affords former Czech citizens the opportunity of former\nCzech citizens of Communist-ruled Czechoslovakia who had lost their Czech citizenship by naturalization in\nthe United States  from 1957 to 1990, or whom acquired citizenship from another country with an international\n6\nhe has never provided any documentary proofs to support his denials (see exs. 5\nthrough 8).  Absent more probative evidence from Applicant on the circumstance of his\nNavy resignation, the Coast Guard\u2019s termination is accepted as the most reliable\nversion of the covered events. \nFollowing several months of unemployment, he joined a large defense contractor\nin January 1985, and stayed with this firm through June 1986 (see ex. 4; Tr. 128-30).\nHis assignments, performance, and circumstances of departure are not documented.\nApplicant returned to the public sector in February 1986. He accepted an\nengineering position with the Coast Guard.  Records reveal, however, that he falsely\nrepresented in his application for Coast Guard employment that he had never been\nterminated from federal service, or resigned in lieu of termination (see ex. 11),\nobscuring the circumstances in which he resigned from his previous Navy service in lieu\nof adverse action.  Because his engineering position required a security clearance, he\nwas required to submit to another background investigation for his clearance.  Based on\ninvestigation reports of his having family members residing in Czechoslovakia (still a\nCommunist-ruled country in the 1980s). Applicant was denied a security clearance, and\nwas terminated from his Coast Guard position in June 1986 (ex. 4). \n  All of the facts and circumstances developed by the Coast Guard are covered in\na 1986 termination letter that was attached and incorporated in a 1986 Merit System\nProtection Board decision affirming Applicant\u2019s denial of a security clearance based on\nhis having relatives in a Communist-controlled country (Czechoslovakia). Because the\nCoast Guard\u2019s denial of Applicant\u2019s security clearance preceded its completion of its\ninvestigation into the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s Navy resignation, the Board declined\nto reach the merits of Applicant\u2019s challenges of his Coast Guard termination (see ex.\n11).  \n After leaving the Coast Guard, Applicant returned to the private sector.  Between\nJanuary 1987 and the present, he has worked for a series of defense contractors (see\nexs. 1 and 4).  Each of his positions required a security clearance, which he has held\ncontinuously since 1987.\nApplicant\u2019s restoration of  his Czech citizenship and passport\nIn 2003, Applicant learned from a friend that the Czech Republic was offering\nformer citizens of Communist-ruled Czechoslovakia, who escaped the Iron Curtain\nbetween 1948 and 1990, the opportunity to regain their birthright citizenship by simply\nasking for it to be reinstated by the Czech Republic and forwarding their birth certificate\nand other pertinent documentation to the proper Czech authorities (see ex. V; Tr. 136).1\n\ntreaty with the Czech Republic prohibiting double citizenship between 1948 and 1990,  to regain their Czech\ncitizenship.  Each application requires the applicant to fill out a declaration and forward it, along with a birth\ncertificate and other documents (in some cases) to the appropriate Czech consulate (see ex. U).\n7\nConcerned about protecting his wife\u2019s property interests in the Czech Republic, and\npreserving his opportunities to return with his wife to live there in the future, Applicant\nexercised this option in July 2003 (see exs. 10 and 12; Tr. 141-44, 164).  In addition to\nacquiring dual citizenship in the Czech Republic, he also obtained a Czech passport.\nIssued in July 2003, his Czech passport  will not expire until 2013 (see exs. 10 and 12). \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws passed away in 2004 (see exs. 9 and T; Tr. 144).  While in\nthe Czech Republic for his father-in-law\u2019s funeral, Applicant used his Czech passport to\nadd his name to the title of property in the Czech Republic that he and his wife inherited\nfrom her father after his death (Tr. 166-67). \nOnce Applicant regained his Czech citizenship and Czech passport, he did not\nnotify his facility security officer (FSO) or any authorized member of his employer\u2019s\norganization of his actions. He acknowledged the NISPOM procedures that governed\nhis security clearance eligibility required clearance holders like himself to notify their\nFSOs when they acquired foreign citizenship and a foreign passport (Tr.  160).  He\nworried, though, that \u201cthese people in JT3 are too incompetent to understand and I don\u2019t\nwant to say anything\u201d (Tr. 160).  So, Applicant did not report to his FSO or other\nappropriate personnel within his employer\u2019s organization that he had obtained Czech\nRepublic citizenship and a Czech passport.\nAsked in a 2008 DOHA interrogatory whether he had any foreign passports in his\npossession, Applicant acknowledged having a Czech passport, which he left in the\nCzech republic (see ex. 9).  He later volunteered information about his accepting an\noffer from the Czech government in 2003 to regain his Czech citizenship without having\nto forfeit his U.S. citizenship (ex. 9).  Besides informing DOHA of his regained Czech\ncitizenship and passport, he has let his supervisors know of his actions (Tr. 99-104.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations were made without any visible confrontation, and reflect\nvoluntary, good-faith disclosures of his regained Czech citizenship and receipt of a\nCzech passport.\nFor some years after receiving his Czech passport, he kept it at his home, never\nusing it to travel abroad.  He took his Czech passport with him to attend his father-in-\nlaw\u2019s funeral in 2004, and left it in the Czech Republic for safe-keeping when he\nreturned to the United States (Tr. 165-67).  He assures he  never used it to enter or exit\nthe Czech Republic (Tr. 165-67). He admitted to needing his Czech passport, though,\nfor acquiring or preserving inherited Czech property (Tr. 166-67, 177-78). \nBy placing his name on the house and property his wife inherited from her father\nin 2004, Applicant acquired joint ownership (Tr. 178). Since acquiring joint ownership in\nhis wife\u2019s inherited property, he invested approximately $20,000 towards the building of\nthe house on the property (Tr. 179).  He estimates the home and property to be worth\n\n8\napproximately $150,000 to $200,000 in U.S. dollars (Tr. 180).  Besides his home and\nproperty, Applicant maintains a bank account in the Czech Republic (Tr. 192). He uses\nthis account to help defray the expenses of his family and their relatives (Tr. 148).  He\nestimates the value of this account to be $1,000 to $1,500 in U.S. dollars (Tr. 193).\nAsked whether he was willing to renounce his Czech citizenship, Applicant\ndeclined (Tr.  163).  He indicated he will need his Czech citizenship when he relocates\nto the Czech Republic with his wife after he retires from his U.S. employment.  Both he\nand his wife desire to return to the country of their birth, where they have their home,\nfamily, and friends (Tr. 178). Applicant still enjoys celebrity status in the Czech Republic\nand is very proud of his Czech roots.   \nWhen asked by Department Counsel whether he was willing to surrender his\nCzech passport, Applicant expressed reluctance to do so without assurances the\npassport would be returned to him when he retires (Tr. 161).  Afforded an opportunity to\nfurther consider his surrender of his Czech passport after the conclusion of the hearing,\nApplicant submitted a letter from his FSO confirming Applicant\u2019s surrender of his Czech\nRepublic passport and its placement in a secure container for safekeeping (see ex. X).\nApplicant placed restrictions on his passport surrender as follows: Should he request\nreturn of the passport at any time, the FSO is instructed to immediately notify\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors, the senior managers of JT3, LLC, and the government official\nresponsible for coordinating security matters with the FSO (ex. X).  Implicit in the\nsurrender reservations is Applicant\u2019s right to request and obtain a release of his Czech\npassport at any time, subject to the noted restrictions.  Under these circumstances,\nApplicant\u2019s passport surrender amounts to a bailment with no time limits placed on\nApplicant\u2019s right to the return of the passport.\nApplicant\u2019s visits to the Czech Republic\nSince becoming a U..S. citizen, Applicant has made five return visits to the\nCzech Republic between December 1982 and August 1986 while Czechoslovakia was\nstill controlled by the Soviet Union and its Czech allies (see ex. 7).  At the time of one of\nhis visits, he was still employed by the U.S. Air Force and held a security clearance (Tr.\n195).  When he arrived in Czechoslovakia, he was met at the airport by over 2,000\nadoring fans, who still remembered his celebrity soccer status (Tr. 122).  At the Czech\nentry office, he was questioned by a Czech agent (Agent A).  Applicant suspected this\nagent was a member of Czech intelligence (see ex. 7; Tr. 150).  Applicant expressed\nconfidence that the Czech agent possessed detailed intelligence about Applicant\u2019s\nbackground and Air Force employment (Tr. 150).\nRecords show Applicant returned to Czechoslovakia in the summer of 1983 for\napproximately 30 days (see ex. 7). While in the country, he was followed by uniformed\nauthorities and individuals in plain clothes (see ex. 8).  When Agent A met him, he\ninquired of Applicant what he would say if he were asked to work for the Czech\ngovernment (ex. 8). Applicant showed a map of the island chain of his state of\nresidence. This map revealed all sections of the state and listed military bases, the\nairport, and other landmarks, but was not a classified document (see ex. 7).  At one\n\n9\ntime, Applicant estimated that he may have obtained the map through his Air Force\nemployment.  However, he denied this possibility at hearing. At some point on this 1983\ntrip, Applicant recollects relinquishing his wrist watch to Agent A, after Agent A inquired\nof Applicant whether there was anything inside the watch (ex. 7). Based on the\nidentifying information from his apartment manager, Applicant believed the Czechs\nsearched his U.S. apartment as well (Tr. 156).\nIn February 1984, Applicant returned to Czechoslovakia to marry his wife and be\npresent for the birth of his son (Tr. 124-25).  He returned in September 1984 to move\nhis wife and children to the United States (Tr.125-26).  On each occasion he met with\nAgent A and was called to a Czech office to confirm in writing that he did not wish to\nwork for the Czechoslovakian  government (Tr. 157).  \nApplicant traveled again to Czechoslovakia in 1992 (months before the country\nwas split in two by peaceful agreement, which paved the way for the establishment of\nthe Czech Republic) to visit family members (Tr. 190).  He made another trip to the\nCzech Republic in 2000, and again in 2004 for his father-in-law\u2019s funeral (Tr. 136). His\nlast trip to the Czech Republic was in 2007 to attend his mother\u2019s funeral (see ex. U; Tr.\n149).\nApplicant was twice interviewed by DSS agents in the 1980s. When first\ninterviewed by a DSS investigator (in April 1985), Applicant discussed his Czech\nheritage and  his naturalization as a U.S. citizen.  In this interview, he disclosed his four\nvisits to Czechoslovakia between 1982 and 1984 (see ex. 5). He assured that if he were\never approached by persons seeking his assistance in doing harmful acts against the\nUnited States, he would file a proper report with federal authorities.  However, Applicant\ndid not disclose his multiple contacts with Agent A.\nAsked what he would do if approached by representatives of a hostile power in a\nfollow-up DSS interview in 1987, Applicant assured he would dismiss any attempts to\npressure or influence him, and would notify the nearest FBI office in the event the\nperson persisted in trying to influence him to engage in any adverse activity against the\nUnited States (see ex. 6). Once again, he did not disclose his contacts with Agent A. \nInterviewed for a third time by a DSS agent (this one in March 1990), Applicant\ndisclosed his contacts with Agent A for the first time (see ex. 7).  It is not clear from his\nsigned, sworn statement covering this interview whether he was confronted by the\ninvestigator in any way with information about Agent A.  When later asked by the same\nDSS agent in a follow-up DSS interview why he did not disclose his contacts with Agent\nA earlier, he explained that he was advised by FBI personnel he interviewed with in\n1983 while looking for work that Agent A\u2019s contacts were not important from an\nintelligence perspective. \n \nBecause no one from DSS or other U.S.  Government sources ever asked him\nspecifically about foreign contacts during his travels to Czechoslovakia, he never\nconsidered them significant enough to merit his disclosing them (ex. 8). While his\n\n10\nexplanations are cause for concern, considering his experiences and knowledge of\nCzechoslovakia when interviewed between 1985-1987, his explanations were never\nchallenged by the Government before this hearing, and are sufficiently plausible to\nwarrant acceptance herein.  \nCzech Republic\u2019s Country Status\nThe Czech Republic was established in January 1993, and has a democratic\ngovernment that is comprised of three branches: a president (chief of state), prime\nminister (head of government), cabinet, bicameral legislature, and a judiciary that\nincludes a Supreme Court and a Constitutional court (see Background Note: Czech\nRepublic, supra).  The Czech Republic has a large diverse economy with a GDP of\n$176.5 billion in 2007 (id., at 2).  The majority of its 10.3 million residents are ethnically\nand linguistically Czech.\nHistorically, the Czech Republic formed the western part of the Czech and\nSlovakia federal Republic. Once an independent state, the Czechs lost their national\nindependence to the Hapsburgs Empire in 1620, and for the ensuing 300 years were\nruled by the Austrian monarchy (see Background Note: Czech Republic, supra).  The\ntwo republics were consolidated into a common state after WW I that comprised\nCzechs, Moravians, and Slovaks. Able to bridge longstanding cultural differences, the\nCzechs and Slovaks joined to form an independent country with President Wilson\u2019s\nsupport at the close of WW I (id., at 2-3).\nGermany invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and established a German\nprotectorate ((see Background Note: Czech Republic, supra).  By this time, Slovakia\nhad declared its independence and had become a puppet state of the Germans.\n Soviet troops overran all of Slovakia, Moravia, and much of Bohemia at the\nclose of WW II (see Background Note: Czech Republic, supra, at 3).  Most of Western\nBohemia was liberated by U.S. forces.  Despite their reunification efforts after the war\n(led by President Benes), their efforts were rebuffed by Soviet-backed forces. Through\ndubious claims of legality, the Communist Party seized power in February 2008 (id.).\nFollowing brief periods of token reforms by the Communist party, the party\nreplaced their head (Novotny) with a Slovak, Alexander Dubcek in January 1968 (see\nBackground Note: Czech Republic, supra, at 3-4). Under Dubcek\u2019s leadership,\nCzechoslovakia initiated political-military changes in the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact\nand expressed desires to improve relations with the West. Dubcek\u2019s modernization\nefforts fueled discord among other Warsaw governments, though, and prompted the\ninvasion by Warsaw Pact forces in August 1968 (id.).  Dubcek and his party reformers\nwere replaced by another Slovak, Gustav Husek.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s (an\nera termed the period of normalization), apologists of the 1968 soviet-led invasion\nbacked their conservative regime.     \n\n11\nHuman rights activism was responsible for the 1989 Civic Forum movement that\nseized power during the so-called \u201cVelvet Revolution\u201d under the leadership of a\ndissident playwright: Vaclav Havel (see Background Note: Czech Republic, supra, at 4).\nCivic Forum and its Slovak counterpart (Public Against Violence) energized millions of\nCzechs and Slovaks and were instrumental in the repudiation and collapse of the\nCommunist party in Czechoslovakia.      \nWith an increasing number of democratic groups seeking influence in\nCzechoslovakia following the Soviet retreat, Slovak calls for more autonomy impeded\nthe functioning of the federal government in Czechoslovakia.  Federalists could not\nstem the growing pressures for a split between th Czechs and Slovaks. With President\nHalvel\u2019s resignation in July 1992, party leaders for the Czechs (Vaclav  Klaus) and the\nSlovaks (Vladamir Mecian) reached an agreement that the two republics would\nseparate and become independent states by the end of 1992 (see Background Note:\nCzech Republic, supra, at 4-5).    \nKlaus remains the president of the Czech Republic. He was re-elected in\nFebruary 2008.  The country\u2019s chamber of deputies split roughly 200 seats between\nthree center-right parties and two parties on the left (see Background Note: Czech\nRepublic, supra, at 5). The chamber currently operates under a fragile three-party\ncoalition that has survived several challenges since 2006 (id.).  \nThe Czech Republic adhered to the foreign policy of the former Soviet Union\nfrom 1948 until 1989, but since independence, the Czechs have made integration with\nWestern institutions their major priority. Today, the Czech Republic is a member of\nNATO (since March 1999) and the European Union (since May 2004).  Membership in\nboth of these organizations represent major advances in the Czech Republic\u2019s Western-\nleaning foreign policy.\nUnited States-Czech bilateral relations have improved considerably since the\nonset of the Velvet Revolution in 1989.  Relations between the two countries are strong\nand reflect common interests and understandings about the challenges facing the world,\nfrom Afghanistan to the Balkans. \nThe Czech government is generally receptive to foreign investment, and\ncontinues to offer incentives for certain types of foreign direct investment on a non-\ndiscriminatory basis (see 2009 Investment Climate-Czech Republic, supra, at 1-2). The\n1993 United States-Czech bilateral investment treaty contains specific guarantees of\nnational treatment and most-favored nation treatment for U.S. investors in all areas of\nthe economy other than insurance and real estate (id. at 2, 7-8). \nAcquisitions and other transactions involving real estate in the Czech Republic by\nforeign persons are controlled by Czech law, however, which limits purchasing and\nfinancing of Czech real estate to Czech residents and non-resident Czech citizens.\nThese real estate limitations are contained in the Czech Republic\u2019s foreign exchange\nact (no. 219/1995 coll.). \n\n12\nThe Czech Republic has a good human rights record and a demonstrated\ncommitment to the rule of law.  While civil disorder is rare in the Czech republic, U.S.\ncitizens traveling to the country are advised by the State Department to remain vigilant\nabout their personal security (see Country Specific Information, Czech Republic, supra,\nat 2).  \n     \nEndorsements\nApplicant has excellent character references to his credit.  Air Force civilians who\ncurrently supervise or work with Applicant, or have done so in the past, credit him with\nunique engineering and linguistic skills. They consistently characterize Applicant as\nconscientious, dedicated, reliable and trustworthy (see exs. D through S)  Consistently,\nthey stress his conscientious work habits and recommend him to a position of trust.\nMost of them, however, do so without any detailed knowledge of his retirement\nintentions or specific circumstances associated with his regaining his Czech citizenship\nand passport (see exs. H, D, F, J, K, and S; Tr. 62-64, 69-75; 48-55, 87-90, and 94-98).\nOne of his character witnesses expressed his understanding that Applicant intended to\nretire to the Czech republic when he reaches the retirement age of 65 (Tr. 83-84).  His\nDepartment head expressed her belief that Applicant might one day want to return to\nthe Czech Republic, but could offer no details of any specific retirement plans (Tr. 99-\n103).  She cited her government customer\u2019s awareness of his Czech citizenship and\npassport issues (Tr. 104).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) list guidelines to be used by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These\nguidelines take into account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for\nthe individual applicant, as well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. These guidelines\ninclude \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d\n(disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate\nsecurity concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or\nnot a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not\nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in reaching at a decision. Each\nof the guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance\nwith AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial, commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk.  When evaluating an applicant\u2019s\n\n13\nconduct, the relevant guidelines are to be considered together with the following AG \u00b6\n2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n     \n Foreign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nSee AG \u00b6  9.\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but\nnot limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.   See AG \u00b6 6.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\n\n14\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends,\nin large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nBorn and raised in the old Communist-ruled Czechoslovakia, Applicant (a\nnationally renowned soccer player) defected in 1969 and immigrated to the United\nStates in 1970.  Over the course of the next 35 plus years he obtained an engineering\ndegree from an accredited U.S. university, worked in various jobs in the public and\nprivate sectors that required security clearances, married a Czech citizen, and raised\nthree children (two of whom he adopted). \nTrust concerns relate to both foreign preference and foreign influence associated\nwith Applicant\u2019s longstanding ties to the Czech Republic and its predecessor\nCzechoslovakia, his regaining his Czech citizenship and a Czech passport with the\nintention of retiring in the Czech Republic in a home he and his wife recently inherited\nand developed. \nAnd, trust concerns arise over documented misstatements of Applicant in the\npast about his travel claim submissions, work history claims in employment applications,\nomissions of pertinent information about foreign agents of the former Czechoslovakia in\nDSS interviews, and his failure to report his obtaining Czech citizenship to appropriate\npersonnel in violation of paragraph 1.302.c of the NISPOM, as amended.  Applicant\u2019s\nrecurrent actions raise concerns about pattern dishonesty and rule violations that are\ncovered by the personal conduct guideline.\n\n15\nForeign Preference \nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite\ncritical considerations over acts indicating a preference for the interests of the foreign\ncountry over the interests of the United States. The issues, as such, raise concerns over\nApplicant\u2019s  preference for a foreign country over the United States.  By virtue of his\ntaking advantage of a special window of opportunity afforded by the Czech government\nin 2003, he acquired Czech citizenship and a Czech passport.  He continued to retain\nand use his Czech citizenship and passport to vest and protect his acquired real estate\nin the Czech Republic, where he hoped to reside  following his eventual retirement from\nhis U.S. job. \nNot until after the hearing did he surrender his Czech passport to his FSO, and\nhe did so with the understanding he would not be renouncing his Czech citizenship, and\nwould be entitled to recover his passport upon request. Although subject to government-\nreporting conditions should he ever request return of his passport, his arrangement\nclearly does not represent an irrevocable surrender, and reflects a qualified\nunderstanding more indicative of a bailment-type arrangement or conditional surrender. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s surrender of his Czech passport may be sufficient to satisfy the\ntechnical surrender requirements of MC \u00b6 11(e) of the AGs for foreign preference (see\ndiscussion infra), it does not in of itself resolve the larger preference question raised in\nthis case.  Whether Applicant\u2019s collective actions reflect an overall preference for his\nbirth country (the Czech Republic), or formulated retirement plan that is not\nincompatible with his imposed fiduciary duties to the United States, are issues that\nrequire reconciling with the security requirements demanded of those who are afforded\naccess to classified information. \nSince becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has taken several actions\nand exercised Czech privileges that reflect active indicia of dual citizenship.\nSpecifically, he regained his Czech citizenship in 2003 that he implicitly renounced\nunder Czech law when he accepted U.S. citizenship in 1977.  Applicant also obtained a\nCzech passport that he used to secure his name on Czech realty his wife inherited from\nher father in 2004. He has expressed his unwillingness to renounce the Czech\ncitizenship he obtained under special circumstances in 2003, and has surrendered his\nCzech passport on the implicit condition he can have it back when he retires from his\nU.S. job, and returns to the Czech Republic to live with his Czech spouse. \nIn assessing split-preference cases, the Appeal Board has looked to indicia of\nactive exercise of dual citizenship.  Where the subject applicant has relied on his foreign\ncitizenship and passport to own and service property in a foreign country that restricts\nownership to residents and individuals with citizenship in that country, the Board has\nconsidered such actions to constitute important considerations of preference.  See\nISCR Case No. 16098 at 2 (App. Bd.  May 29, 2003). \n\n16\nSo, too, in cases where there is record evidence of a dual-citizen applicant\u2019s\nhaving substantial real property interests in a country that are not available to non-\nresidents or citizens on the same terms, the Appeal Board has considered such\ninterests to represent special benefits or privileges that reveal a preference to that\nparticular country.  See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009). \nHere, Applicant used his prior Czechoslovakian birth and citizen status to restore\nhis Czech citizenship and obtain a Czech passport that enabled him to qualify for\nplacing his name on his wife\u2019s inherited real estate in the Czech Republic.  His regaining\nhis Czech citizenship and passport enabled him to qualify for acceptance of prospective\ninheritance benefits following her father\u2019s death.  His actions represent material indicia\nof a preference for the Czech Republic that cannot be easily reconciled with the split\npreference he has shown for many years for his adopted country, the United States.  \nPreference questions require predictive judgments about how an applicant can\nbe trusted in the future to honor his fiduciary responsibilities to the Government.  In\nApplicant\u2019s case, he was manifestly aware of the security significance of his obtaining\nCzech citizenship and a Czech passport while continuing to hold a U.S. security\nclearance.  For he admittedly failed to report to appropriate personnel that he obtained\nhis Czech citizenship and passport, in violation of paragraph 1.302.c of the NISPOM.\nAnd, he acknowledged his acute mistrust in the JT3 people responsible for processing\nhis foreign citizenship information.  While his choices may be understandable, they also\nreflect a current and ongoing preference for his roots in the Czech Republic over his\nlongstanding preferences for the United States.   \nBecause Applicant regained his Czech citizenship and Czech passport while still\nholding a U.S. security clearance (without notifying appropriate officials), the\nGovernment may apply certain provisions of disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a) of AG\n\u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This DC includes but\nis not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such         \n           benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another    \n           country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n\n17\n(7) voting in a foreign election.\u201d  \nSpecifically, DC \u00b6 10(a)(1)(3) and (5) both apply to the established facts and\ncircumstances herein.  By regaining his Czech citizenship and passport, Applicant was\nable to accept special real estate and mortgage borrowing benefits in the Czech\nRepublic that are not currently available to non-Czech residents and citizens. The\nCzech Republic\u2019s foreign exchange act (Act No. 210/1995) restricts the acquisition of\nreal estate in the country to residents and non-resident Czech citizens.  \nWere Applicant to renounce his Czech citizenship and unconditionally surrender\nhis Czech passport, he risks a potential forfeiture of his property and his inability to\nregain his Czech citizenship status once he assumed retirement status in the country.\nHis election to retain the Czech citizenship he acquired and reserve his right to retrieve\nthe Czech passport he turned over for safekeeping represent entirely rational and\nunderstandable choices on Applicant\u2019s part.  They also reflect clear preferences for his\nhome country of the Czech Republic, where he hopes to retire with his wife in a few\nyears.  \nApplicant surrendered his Czech passport in August 2009, in accordance with\nestablished procedures for surrendering a foreign passport to a cognizant security\nauthority. In doing so, he does forfeit the short-term flexibility of unfettered and\nundocumented travel.  Applicant is quite right on this point. And, he may, accordingly,\nclaim the benefits of another mitigating condition under Guideline C. MC  \u00b6 11(e), \u201cthe\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated,\u201d is fully applicable as well to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Because his\ndual citizenship status is not based solely on his parent\u2019s citizenship, he may not claim\nthe benefits of MC \u00b6 11(a), \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or\nbirth in a foreign country.\u201d Nor are any of the other potential mitigating conditions\navailable to Applicant based on the developed record. \nWhole person precepts are certainly helpful to Applicant in surmounting the\nGovernment\u2019s preference concerns herein.  The strong trust impressions he has forged\nwith his supervisors, coworkers and friends who have worked with him add support to\nhis claims that during his more than 25 years of faithful service to the defense industry\nhe has demonstrated undivided loyalty and preference for U.S. institutions and this\ncountry\u2019s core values.  \nOverall, though, Applicant is not able to persuade that his current preference is\nstill with the United States. Because he made considerable use of Czech privileges\nassociated with his regaining his Czech citizenship and passport in 2003 during a\nnarrow window of opportunity bestowed on former citizens of Czechoslovakia who\ndefected before 1990, he manifested a preference for the Czech Republic under the\ncriteria as established by the Appeal Board. Applicant fails to absolve himself of foreign\npreference concerns associated with the presented issue of whether his preference lies\nwith his adopted country (United States), or the country where he was born and raised\n(currently the Czech Republic) before he defected in 1969 to escape Communist rule.\n\n18\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of Guideline C.\nForeign influence \nApplicant and his family have deep roots in the Czech Republic, a country rich in\nhistory and socio/political traditions, and Communist domination during the post WW II\nyears.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party in 1989, the\nreconstituted Czech Republic has flourished under well-established constitutional\ngovernment and institutional respect for human rights, and benefits from strong bilateral\nrelations with the United States. As a member of NATO and the European Union, the\nCzech Republic has been able to forge strong political, military and economic ties with\nWestern Europe, as well as the United States.  Foreign ownership of real estate in the\nCzech Republic remains one of the few areas of disagreement between the Czech\nRepublic and this country.\nThe Government urges trust concerns over risks that Applicant might use his\nCzech contacts to exploit his real estate and other interests in the Czech Republic as he\nprepares himself and his family for retirement in that country.  Because he still has two\nbrothers and his wife\u2019s family members residing in the Czech Republic, he might be\nsubject to undue foreign influence by Czech government authorities to access sensitive\nproprietary information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  As such, he and his family\npresent potential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition  (DC) \u00b6\n7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion,\u201d of the AGs for foreign influence. The citizenship/residence status of these\nfamily members in the Czech Republic, combined with Applicant\u2019s own demonstrated\npreference for the country, do pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of\nthe risks of undue foreign influence that could potentially affect his use of his acquired\nreal estate in the Czech Republic.  \nApplicant has no immediate family members resident in the Czech Republic,\nexcept for his two brothers (only one of whom he has provided any financial support).\nAnd neither of his brothers have any known relationships with the Czech government or\nmilitary.  Moreover, his wife\u2019s parents and sister are all deceased, and she has no\nrelatives who have contacts with Applicant. Any potential conflict that might be\nassociated with her deceased husband\u2019s pension benefits is small and not likely to pose\nany conflicts of interest for Applicant in the foreseeable future.  And, from all that is\nknown, Applicant\u2019s  spouse does not have any identified prior military or government\nservice that could create potential conflicts of interest.   \n Because none of Applicant\u2019s living family or his wife\u2019s family have any identified\nfamily members that could place any of them in any foreseeable conflict situation, no\nconsideration of DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\n\n19\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is warranted herein.\nApplicant and his immediate family members (i.e., his younger brothers) residing\nin the Czech Republic have deep family roots in their country of birth. Their citizenship\nstatus and presence in the Czech Republic does not by itself create a heightened risk.\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his family members are manageable risks, and clearly not of\nthe magnitude that could make them subject to a heightened security risk of pressure or\ncompromise under Guideline B.  As a country, the Czech Republic has a lengthy history\nof constitutional government and generally recognized respect for human rights and the\nrule of law. It maintains a strong bilateral relationship with the United States in the\nimportant areas of trade and investment. The Czech Republic continues to be a country\nwith emerging strategic relationships with the United States in the War on Terror, and is\na country that at present does not present a heightened risk under Guideline B.\nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or mandate\nparticular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of foreign\ncountries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing in the\nsupplied materials and country information about the Czech Republic.  Unlike the old\nAGs, the new ones do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the\nUnited States as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives\nwith citizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The\ngeopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter. \nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  is\navailable to Applicant.  Neither Applicant, his wife, nor his immediate or extended family\nresiding in the Czech Republic pose heightened security risks that could subject them to\npotential pressures and influence from Czech Republic government and military\nofficials. \nOf benefit to Applicant, too, is MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\nloyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the United States, is well\ndemonstrated and sufficient under these circumstances to neutralize all potential\nconflicts that are implicit in his relationships with his relatives. MC \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\n\n20\nlikelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has some\napplicability, too, based on Applicant\u2019s infrequent contacts with his younger brothers.\n \n MC \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or\nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d is not available to\nApplicant.  His financial interests in the Czech Republic are considerable and account\nfor major reasons why he has been unwilling to renounce his Czech citizenship and\nsurrender his Czech passport unconditionally.\nNot available to Applicant either is MC \u00b6 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly\ncomplied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts,\nrequests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country.\u201d\nApplicant was slow to recognize the importance of his contacts with Agent A and\nacknowledge his meetings with Agent A several years later when he was re-interviewed\nby a DSS agent.  And, Applicant failed to promptly notify appropriate personnel of his\nacquiring Czech citizenship and a Czech passport in accordance with NISPOM\nrequirements.\nWhole person assessment is available to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to any\npotential conflicts of interests with his Czech family members residing in the Czech\nRepublic.  His supervisors and coworkers who have worked with him for many years\nand consider him very reliable and trustworthy.  Moreover, Applicant is not aware of any\nrisks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of his family members might be\nexposed to.  So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the potential risk of coercion, pressure, or influence\nbeing brought to bear on him, his wife, or any of their family members residing in the\nCzech Republic is minimal and mitigated.  Applicant has no immediate family members\nresident in the Czech Republic\nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's having\nproperty interests and family members residing in the Czech Republic are sufficiently\nmitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand any\nCzech risks of undue influence. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by Guideline B.\nPersonal Conduct \nPersonal \nconduct \nconcerns \nover \nApplicant\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability \nand\ntrustworthiness are raised under Guideline E as the result of his exhibited past failures\nto promptly and properly  report his travel expense claims while employed by the Navy,\nthe reasons for his Navy resignation, the circumstances surrounding  his contacts with\nAgent A in the early 1980s, and his regaining his Czech citizenship and passport in\n2003 (after being issued a top secret security clearance). His actions reflect serious\nlapses in judgment and trust for which \u00b6 16(d)(3), \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rules\nviolations,\u201d of the AGs for personal conduct is applicable.  \n\n21\nMost of Applicant\u2019s judgment lapses are quite aged and were well known to the\nGovernment by 1990.  By this time, Applicant had already held a security clearance with\nthe defense contractors who employed him.  His disclosures to DSS investigators in\n1990 of his contacts with Agent A during his prior visits to Czechoslovakia does not\nappear to have adversely affected his security clearance status in any visible way.\nApplicant has continued to hold security clearances with defense contractors for\nthe ensuing 19 years he has worked in the defense industry.  During this period, he has\nimpressed his supervisors and coworkers with his engineering and linguistic skills, his\nconscientious work habits, and his exhibited trustworthiness. He is credited with\nfollowing all of his employers\u2019 administrative and security guidelines in his numerous\ntasked assignments and has not been cited with any other security breaches.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to promptly notify appropriate personnel of his obtaining his\nCzech citizenship (in violation of paragraph 1.302.c of the NISPOM) is more recent and\nwas undertaken with Applicant\u2019s clear knowledge of the reporting requirements for\nclearance holders like himself.  But Applicant has since told his department head, who\nnotified her company\u2019s government customer. Applicant is also on record as fully\ndisclosing his obtaining Czech citizenship and a Czech passport in his 2008 answers to\nDOHA interrogatories.   \nMitigating conditions are available to Applicant based on the age of his cited\nmisrepresentations and omissions that occurred in the 1980s and have long been\nknown to the Government.  MC \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \nTrue, recurrent action, such as Applicant\u2019s initial non-disclosure of his Czech\ncitizenship and passport as a clearance holder, can, if not separately mitigated, create a\nrecurrent pattern of breaches of recognized employment norms, rules and regulations\nthat could require continued scrutiny. However, more recent citizenship and passport\nnon-disclosures are mitigated by corrective actions.  Without a recurrent pattern to\nevaluate, Applicant\u2019s older judgment lapses are mitigated by the passage of time and\npositive input from his supervisors and coworkers who have worked with him for many\nyears.     \nBased on Applicant\u2019s documented disclosures of most of the judgment and trust\nlapses that have been attributed to Applicant, MC \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur,\u201d has some application as well.  And Applicant may take some advantage of MC\n17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d   \n\n22\nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily impose important duties of trust\nand candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically\nimposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).   By\nhis actions demonstrated in these proceedings and over the course of his past 20 plus\nyears of employment in the defense industry, Applicant recognizes his trust\nresponsibilities.  \nFrom a whole person standpoint, Applicant documents favorable assessments\nfrom his supervisors, coworkers, and former colleagues, who know him and have\nworked with him throughout his professional career in the defense industry. The\ncumulative effects of past and recent judgment lapses are outweighed by the sum of his\nprior disclosures and documented positive contributions to the defense industry over the\npast 20 plus years. \nBased on a consideration of the applicable guidelines for personal conduct and a\nwhole person assessment, Applicant mitigates the personal conduct specifically\nassociated with his aged terminations, misstatements and omissions, and more recent\nnon-disclosure of his Czech citizenship to appropriate personnel in a timely way. Taking\ninto account all of the facts and circumstances developed in the record, favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the personal conduct\nguideline.  \nThe remaining allegation covered by the personal conduct guideline\n(subparagraph 3.a) was disputed by Applicant and not substantiated by the evidence\npresented in the record.  This allegation is mitigated for lack of substantiating proof.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in AG \u00b6 2(a).\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubpara. 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubpara. 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubpara. 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n23\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.f:\nFor applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara. 3.a:\nFor Applicant \nSubpara. 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 3.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 3.f:\nFor applicant\nSubpara. 3.g:\nFor applicant\n Conclusions\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

CREAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRay T. Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 56-year-old program manager who lost employment with a defense contractor\n\n2\nwhen he was denied access to classified information.  Applicant committed lewd acts on his young\nstep-daughter over approximately an 18 month period in violation of state law.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 25, 2005.  The SOR alleges two security concerns under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 12, 2005.  He admitted a shoplifting\nallegation but denied an allegation of lewd acts upon a child under Guidelines J.  He provided an\nexplanation for his actions.  Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge, and the\nrequest was received by DOHA on May 17, 2005.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with\nthe case, and a hearing before another Administrative Judge was held on November 10, 2005.  The\nAdministrative Judge rendered an unfavorable security clearance decision on February 6, 2006.  The\nDOHA Appeal Board issued a decision on October 31,  2006, remanding the case for a new hearing\nand decision before a new administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on October 31,  2006.\nApplicant requested a delay of the hearing.  A notice of hearing was issued on November 15, 2006,\nand the hearing convened on January 16, 2007.  Eight government exhibits, marked Government\nExhibits 1-8, were offered and six were admitted.  Government Exhibits 4 and 8 were not admitted,\nbut administrative notice was taken of facts in exhibit 8.  The government presented the testimony\nof two witnesses.  Applicant offered 60 exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits A-HHH.  Of the\nApplicant exhibits, 44 were admitted and 16 were not admitted.  The Applicant and one Applicant\nwitness testified.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 24, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nRelevant and material information:\nAs noted below, Applicant was charged with lewd acts upon a child by state authorities.  He\npled guilty to simple assault pursuant to a pre-trial agreement with prosecutors.  In the first DOHA\nhearing, Department Counsel introduced evidence concerning the lewd acts.  Applicant tried to\npresent his evidence to  contest the government\u2019s evidence of lewd acts, but the administrative judge\ndetermined his guilty plea to simple assault prevented him from presenting his evidence.  The DOHA\nAppeal Board reversed the first decision based on the administrative judge\u2019s decision not to permit\nApplicant the opportunity to present evidence to contest the lewd acts.\n\nTr. Volume I, 27-31, 34-36.\n1\nTr. Volume II, 205-215.\n2\nSee, Tr. Volume II, Tr. 80, 114-115, 123-125, 140-142, 189, 203.\n3\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated April 26, 2003); Tr.

Volume II, 147-149; Applicant Exhibit EE (Petition for Relief, dated May 11, 2005).\n6\n3\nAt the second hearing, the government again introduced evidence concerning the lewd acts\nupon a child.  Applicant was permitted to introduce any evidence or information that was relevant and\nmaterial to the lewd acts as well as evidence concerning the credibility of the two government\nwitnesses, A, the victim, and her mother, Mrs. M. \nAdmission of exhibits:\nThe government offered eight exhibits.  Six of the exhibits were admitted.  Government\nExhibit 4 was not admitted since it was a hearsay statement from an individual who was not a party\nto the issues raised in the SOR allegation or the hearing.   Government Exhibit 8 was an article on\n1\nchild abuse that was used to establish facts for administrative notice.   \n2\nApplicant introduced 60 exhibits.  Of these. 44 were admitted as relevant and material to the\nissues concerning the lewd acts and the credibility of witnesses at the hearing.  The other Applicant\nexhibits were not admitted because they were not relevant and material to the lewd acts issues or the\ncredibility of the witnesses.3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 56-year-old college graduate who has worked for defense contractors as a\nprogram manger.  He was born in Italy but came to the United States as a young child, and is a\nnaturalized United States citizen.  When he was denied access to classified information, he lost his\nposition with the defense contractor.  He is now a self-employed business process engineer.\nApplicant served in the Navy for six years, held a security clearance, and received an honorable\ndischarge.

He pled guilty to a reduced charge of\ntrespassing, served five days of community service, paid a fine, and completed three years of\nprobation without incident.   After the period of probation on petition of Applicant, the conviction\n5\nwas set aside.6\n\nTr. Volume I, 45-48.\n7\nTr. Volume II, 176-200.\n8\nTr. Volume I, 155-157, 184-186.\n9\nTr. Volume I, 178-179.\n10\n4\nApplicant has been married twice.  He has three adult children by his first marriage.  He\nseparated from his first wife in 1996, and their divorce was final in May 1998.  Applicant\u2019s first wife\nand his children moved from a city on the west coast to a city on the east coast.  Applicant stayed\non the west coast to work.  His children went to school and became friendly with the children of Mrs.\nM.  She had four children, B the oldest child a girl, two boys, C and D, and her youngest daughter\nA.  On a visit to see his family in 1996, Applicant was introduced to Mrs. M by his children.  At the\ntime, she lived on the east coast and he lived on the west coast.  They had a long distance\nrelationship for 18 months, and then married in June 1998 when his divorce became final.  For the\nfirst 18 months of the marriage, Applicant spent two weeks each month on the west coast and two\nweeks on the east coast living with Mrs. M and her family.  In late 1999, he moved permanently to\nthe east coast.  He worked from home until mid-2001, when his company went out of business.  The\nmarriage between Mrs. M and Applicant was acrimonious and they separated in 2002, and divorced\nin 2006.7\nMrs. M, her four children, Applicant, and Applicant\u2019s son, spent a weekend together in a\nmountain cabin in 1997.  A was approximately nine years old at the time.  As the group was talking,\nA was sitting on a couch and Applicant was sitting on the floor next to her.  As a joke was made,\nApplicant put his head in A\u2019s groin area and moved it back and forth in a motion like shaking his\nhead to indicate yes or no.  This made her feel very uncomfortable.  She told her sister and then her\nmother.  Her mother was not concerned about the incident and did not talk to Applicant about it.\nApplicant\u2019s son was 12 years old at the time.  He did not see or observe any inappropriate conduct\nby his father towards A.  He also stated that A\u2019s actions towards his father in later years were always\nfriendly and she appeared comfortable and relaxed around him.   Shortly after this weekend, Mrs.\n8\nM and Applicant married.  He was Mrs. M\u2019s fourth husband.   \n9\nApplicant moved permanently to the house on the east coast.  Applicant had an office in the\nhouse to do his work for his employer.  He had a computer and other equipment in the office area.\nA did a lot of her homework in the office area because the computer in that room had greater\nflexibility and capability than the family\u2019s other computer.  The office also had other equipment in\nthe room, like music and photography equipment.  Applicant would also help A with her homework\nprojects, usually math and creative writing.  \n10\nDuring this time, A was between nine and 13 years of age.  A stated that whenever Applicant\nhad the opportunity, he touched her.  When she was standing in the kitchen, he would purposely\nwalk by her and press his hand on her buttock.  A testified that when she worked in the office area\nwith Applicant, he would usually lock the door.  He would place his hand on her thigh.  He would\npick his hand up to use the computer but he would returned it to her thigh, placing it closer to her\ngroin area.  He took these actions whenever he could, about 25 times in the two weeks he was in the\nhouse.  She would continue to go to the office area with him because she needed his help to complete\nher homework and improve her grades.  A did not like his actions and one time threw his hand away\n\nTr.

He would hug her a lot of times with his hands and fingers on the sides of her breast area.\nHe would use his fingers to rub her around her breast area.  Applicant would put his hands on her\nthighs and move them up to her groin area.  All of the actions took place above her clothes.11\nA felt uncomfortable and \u201cgrossed out\u201d by Applicant\u2019s actions.  She told her sister and a few\nclose friends about Applicant\u2019s actions.  She tried to tell her mother about his actions and her\nfeelings, but her mother did not understand.  In the spring of 2002 when she was in the seventh\ngrade, Applicant told a school counselor that her stepfather had been touching her inappropriately.\nThe counselors called her mother to the school.  In the counselor\u2019s office, A told her mother about\nthe actions of Applicant.  Her mother did not influence or direct her to tell the school counselors\nabout Applicant\u2019s actions.  After the school counselors called her mother and she told her about the\nallegations, her mother\u2019s advice was to tell the truth about what happened.12\nMrs. M had no idea about Applicant\u2019s action towards A before she was called to the school\nby the counselors.   She remembered that A told her about the incident in the mountain cabin but\n13\nfelt she misunderstood what happened and it was something else.  When A told her of Applicant\u2019s\nactions, she was confused, shocked, and angry.  When she returned home that day and before A\nreturned from school, she confronted Applicant.  He basically did not deny any of the accusations.\nMrs. M stated:\n\u201cHe really said nothing.  Did not deny anything.  He looked like he had been a person\nwho was caught.  And he - and I said, I - I mean, I did most of the talking because he\nhardly said anything.\u201d14\nMrs. M told Applicant he was not to be behind closed doors in his office with A.  When A\nreturned from school that day, Mrs. M, A, and Applicant had a discussion.  Because he had been out\nof work, he was drinking which made him not care what he was doing or how he was touching her.\nAt the time, he had been out of work for about eight months.  She did not ask Applicant to leave the\nhome on the advice of her friends and minister.  The school authorities did not report the incidents\nto the police.   A few days after the incident was reported to Mrs. M by school authorities, she and\n15\nApplicant were in church.  Applicant asked her to forgive him for his actions.  Eventually, Applicant\nmoved from the house and lived for a time with a neighbor.  \nThe couple had sever financial problems since Applicant was not employed full time, Mrs.\nM helped support him, and Applicant complained she used his money to pay some of her debts.

Volume I, 55-57.\n17\nGovernment Exhibit 5 (Indictment, dated December 11, 2002).  The criminal statute for lewd acts upon a child\n18\nreads: \u201cIt is unlawful for a person over the age of fourteen years to willfully and lewdly commit or attempt a lewd or\nlascivious act upon the body, or its parts, of a child under the age of sixteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing\nto, or gratifying the lust or passion or sexual desires of the person or of the child.\u201d  Commentary on the offense shows\nit is the act commonly referred to as child molestation.\nApplicant Exhibit QQ (Attorney affidavit, dated March 1, 2005).\n19\nTr. Volume II, 102-108.\n20\nTr. Volume II, 17-37; See, Applicant Exhibit A (Financial activity spreadsheet, December 1999-2002);\n21\nApplicant Exhibit R (Christmas letter, 2000).\nSee, Applicant Exhibit ZZ, (Note from Mrs. M, undated); Applicant Exhibits RR, SS, and TT (messages,\n22\nvarious dates).\n6\nfriction between them over finances and other issues led to their eventual divorced.16\nOn the advice of friends and her minister, Mrs. M eventually reported the incidents\nconcerning A to a state social service agency.  The agency in turn reported the incidents to law\nenforcement.   Applicant was indicted by the grand jury for the offense of committing or attempting\n17\nlewd acts upon a child under sixteen.   Applicant\u2019s attorney felt there was not sufficient facts to\n18\nwarrant conviction.  The prosecutor offered a plea of guilty to simple assault which was accepted.\nAlthough Applicant did not want to plead to any wrongdoing, his attorney felt it was best to plead\nto the offense rather than take chances with a jury.   In addition, at the same time Applicant was\n19\ninvolved with his divorce from Mrs. M, and was incurring attorney and witness fees.  He did not\nhave the financial resources for both the divorce and the criminal action.  It was best for him to plead\nto the lesser offense.20\nApplicant denied inappropriately touching A or committing lewd acts upon her at any time.\nHe testified Mrs. M had a financial reason to fabricate the allegations against him.  When they\ndivorced, Applicant and Mrs. M would divide the marital assets if the divorce was a no fault action.\nIf there was a significant reason for the divorce, like his actions towards A, Mrs. M would receive\nthe marital assets and significant financial payments.  Applicant presented documents and testified\nthat Mrs. M constantly was concerned about how he was using his financial assets.  She was upset\nbecause he still assisted his ex-wife and his children with financial resources.  He assisted them\nbecause he felt he had an obligation to take care of his first family.  He spent his assets to fix up Mrs.\nM\u2019s house and increase its value.  The couple had separate and joint checking accounts and both\nspent money from the accounts.  His siblings complained to him about a Christmas letter prepared\nby Mrs. M that did not mention the children from his first marriage, but just Mrs. M\u2019s children.21\nTheir marriage was not a loving, family oriented marital relationship.22\nApplicant denies that the lewd acts upon A took placed, or if there was improper actions, it\n\nTr.

He does not remember exactly what took place in the mountain cabin in 1997.\n23\nHe believes whatever took place was a playful act at best.  He remembers resting his head on A\u2019s\nknees.  When Mrs. M talked to him about the incident later that night, she stated A had a \u201cyucky\nsexual feeling.\u201d  He did not understand what the incident was about and started wondering how an\neight year old could think such sexual thoughts.  That is the thought that stood out in his mind.  He\ndid not know or think A had any concerns about his conduct towards her.  He asked his son what he\nsaw and his son reinforced his belief concerning the incident.  He was completely baffled by A\u2019s\nallegations of sexual misconduct based on this incident.  He did not think anything of her actions\nsince he considered her reactions to him as nothing out of the ordinary for a daughter.24\nApplicant stated that there was an atmosphere of sexuality in Mrs M\u2019s household when he\ncame to live there.  This atmosphere of sexuality also affected how A looked at the incident at the\nmountain cabin and on his actions in the computer room.  Mrs. M\u2019s two oldest children, B the oldest\ndaughter, and C, the oldest son, created sexual play within the household that would affect A\u2019s view\nof any action by Applicant.   However, Applicant also stated that A and Mrs. M\u2019s youngest son, D\n25\nwere good children.  He referred to A as the \u201cjewel in that crown.\u201d26\nApplicant was \u201cfloored\u201d by A\u2019s allegations of inappropriate contact.  He stated that if he\ntouched A\u2019s beasts it was not intentional.  He put his hand on her legs but he does not recall traveling\nvery far between her legs.  He did not touch her on her vaginal area.  He may have hit her buttocks\nat times but not in a sexual way.   There was a good friendly relationship of stepdaughter to\n27\nstepfather between he and A.  She kept coming to him for help and assistance.  She considered him\nas a father and sat near him and placed her legs over his.  Pictures of them together appear to show\nthat they had fun together and seemed to be enjoying themselves.   He stated that A would sit next\n28\nto him while they watched television or used the computer.  While using the computer in his office,\nthey would laugh and talk.  Many times, he told her to use the other computer outside the office since\nhe was engaged in working for his company.  At times, A would throw herself at him or fall and\nexpect him to catch her.  So there may have been some incidental touching.   After the allegation\n29\nof inappropriate conduct was made, Applicant tried to avoid A but she kept asking him for help with\nher work until she left for a vacation in Alaska.   When confronted by Mrs. M about committing an\n30\nact on A, he felt it was a better strategy to admit the possibility of an action rather than start an\nargument.  He issued a general apology and moved on.  He asked for forgiveness in church so the\nissue would not escalate.  He heard about issues going crazy and did not want to suddenly end up\n\nTr.

The syndrome leads to secrecy,\nhelplessness, entrapment and accommodation, delayed and unconvincing disclosure, and retraction.\nA did not talked to her mother about Applicant\u2019s actions but did talk to her sister.  She felt helpless\nabout the situation and did not seek intervention.  She told of the abuse only when she was older and\nwanted a separate life style and challenged the authority of her mother and stepfather.  It is typical\nfor a mother not to know of the action  of the father or stepfather because a women does not commit\nher life and the security of her children to a person capable of molesting them.  The obvious clues\nof abuse are usually evident only in retrospect.  The disclosure to the school authorities is consistent\nwith normal actions of a child involved in abuse.32\nApplicant presented a number of character affidavits prepared for the divorce proceedings\nfrom Mrs. M.  An affidavit from his sister questions the credibility of Mrs. M because she did not\nmention all of her marriages to her.  She saw B engage in public inappropriate sexual conduct.  She\nalso saw that A was needy and clinging to Applicant.  She also stated that Applicant was a positive\nperson but he became stressed and depressed because of his relationship with Mrs. M.   \n33\nApplicant\u2019s first wife stated she has known him for over 27 years.  Applicant was a model\nfather and caring towards his children.  She observed A and felt she was starved for a father figure.\nA hung on Applicant whenever she observed them together.  Mrs. M was always hostile towards her\nand always talked disparagingly of Applicant.   \n34\nA daughter from his first marriage states that Applicant has never made her feel\nuncomfortable.  He always treated her in a supportive and loving manner.  She never felt\napprehensive about having her female friends over to her house.  Her father is a kind man that puts\ncomfort and feelings of other first.   Applicant\u2019s oldest son notes he dated the A\u2019s older sister, B.\n35\nHe observe that the family dynamics were odd with argumentative, violent, and vengeful behavior.\nIt made him feel uncomfortable.   \n36\nTwo friends and neighbors, who lived near Applicant and his first family on the west coast,\nstated that Applicant was a good friend who always treated their children correctly.  Applicant gave\nquality time to all of his children and never made his or their children uncomfortable.

Some of these affidavits are from childhood\nfriends of the children from his first family that attests that they never felt uncomfortable or\nthreatened by him.39\nA\u2019s testimony was credible.  She testified clearly and precisely about the incidents and was\ndirect and not hesitant.  Applicant\u2019s testimony was ambiguous and contradictory.  At times, he did\nnot answer questions directly.  Mrs. M\u2019s testimony was also credible.

The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n44\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.45\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n46\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n47\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n48\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n49\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 50\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline J - A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n\n11\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant was convicted and sentenced for shoplifting in 1997.  He was indicted by a grand\njury for lewd acts upon a child in 2002.  These criminal acts raise Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.2 (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (A single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses).  Applicant was indicted for lewd acts upon a child.  He reached an agreement\nwith the prosecutor, pled guilty to a lesser offense as part of the plea bargain, and sentenced for simple\nassault.  The indictment for the lewd acts upon a child is sufficient to establish the disqualifying\nconditions.\nThere is no issue that Applicant committed the offense of shoplifting since he admitted the act\nand acknowledges the conviction and sentencing.  This misdemeanor offense occurred in 1996.\nApplicant successfully completed his probation period.  He has not been involved in any other theft\ntype offense or misdemeanor offense since this incident.  The offense happened over ten year ago.\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (The conduct was not recent) applies.\nEven though there is an offense for lewd acts upon a child, CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (The crime was an\nisolated incident) applies since the shoplifting was a one time theft offense.  Since, the shoplifting\noffense is not recent and an isolated theft offense, Applicant has mitigated security concerns based on\nthe shoplifting charge.\nApplicant\u2019s lewd actions was established by A\u2019s testimony.  She credibly testified Applicant\nplaced his head in her lap and moved his head around.  While in their home, Applicant placed his hand\non her leg, moving toward her groin a number of times, and placed his hands on her sides near her\nbreast while hugging her.  A was approximately eights year old during the incident at the mountain\ncabin.  She was between nine and 13 during the incidents at the home in the computer area.  She\ndescribed how Applicant\u2019s touching made her feel uncomfortable.  Applicant denies that he committed\nlewd acts upon A.  At first, he said absolutely that the acts did not take place.  Then he stated that if\nthey did take place, his actions were unintentional.  Applicant\u2019s denial is also based on his allegation\nthat (1) Mrs. M fabricated the whole episode and had A fabricate the incident to gain a financial\nadvantage over Applicant in their divorce proceeding, and (2) the atmosphere in the home created by\nMrs. M\u2019s oldest children was sexually explicit and gave A the false impression of Applicant\u2019s actions.\nMrs. M knew of the mountain cabin incident because A told her about it, and she talked to Applicant\nabout it.  Applicant did not deny something may have happened, but that it was unintentional.  Mrs.\nM did not know of the other touching incidents until A told school counselors about the actions of her\nstepfather.  The allegation concerning the incidents did not come from Mrs. M but from the A.  The\ndirections Mrs. M gave her daughter was to tell the truth.  Appellant did not raise sufficient facts to\nestablish that Mrs. M either fabricated the action or had her daughter lie about Applicant\u2019s actions.\n\n12\nEven if Applicant had established that Mrs. M had a reason to fabricate the story, since the allegation\ndid not come from her, he has not refuted that the lewd acts upon a child took place.  \nApplicant raised sufficient information that the family atmosphere in Mrs. M\u2019s house created\nby her two oldest children was sexually risky and probably dysfunctional.  Applicant argues the sexual\natmosphere created a false impression in A as to the meaning of Applicant\u2019s action.  However, A\nclearly testified as to Applicant\u2019s in appropriate actions and how they made her feel.  She described\nhis actions in placing his hands along side her breast and rubbing her leg near her groin area.  I\nconclude that Applicant committed lewd acts upon A, a child under sixteen.\nAfter determining that the alleged lewd acts by Applicant took place, I considered Criminal\nConduct Mitigating Conditions E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was not recent), CC MC\nE2.A10.1.3.2 (The crime was an isolated incident), CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3 (The person was pressured\nor coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person\u2019s life), and\nCC MC E2.A10.1.3.5 (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).  The criminal activity of\nlewd acts upon a child took place over a period of time from June of 1999 to December 2003, after\nApplicant moved to Mrs. M\u2019s house.  His criminal behavior took place about three to four years ago\nand that is recent.  There were lewd acts upon the child that took place over an approximate three year\nperiod, so the incidents are not isolated.  Applicant presented testimony that A came to his office area,\nsat near him, placed her legs on his, and took other actions towards him.  As an adult, he cannot be\ncoerced by the actions of a child to commit lewd acts on that child.  He was not pressured by A to\ncommit a lewd act on her.  I considered the affidavits from friends, neighbors, and family members\nattesting that Applicant is a good, loving, and caring father.  However, this character evidence is\noutweighed by the testimony of A about Applicant\u2019s actions towards her.  Applicant presented\ninsufficient information of any rehabilitation concerning lewd acts on a child.  Applicant has failed to\nrefute the allegations against him that he committed lewd act on a child.  Such acts are criminal in\nviolation of state statute.  He has not presented sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns\nfor his actions with A.  \nI further reviewed all of the record evidence under the \u201cwhole person\u2019 concept.  I considered\nthe letters of recommendation attesting to the good character of Applicant.  Applicant was accused of\ncommitting the heinous act of lewd conduct upon a child.  He did not vigorously deny the conduct, but\nattempted to explain and justify it.  He blamed A for misinterpreting his actions or her siblings for\ncreating an atmosphere to misinterpret.  His explanations are simply not credible or believable.  He\nwas silent when first confronted and apologized to Mrs. M.  In his testimony, he was equivocal, first\ndenying the actions then saying if they took place it was unintended.  As an adult and the father figure\nin the family unit, he was placed in a position to use good judgment and be responsible.  How one\nbehaves in this position provides an indication of how a person may behave in regard to protecting\nclassified information.  His actions show poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness.\nSomeone who displayed such traits in his family raises security concerns when protecting classified\ninformation.  I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.  Guideline J is decided against\nApplicant and clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n13\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are;\nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.\nThomas M. Crean\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 13, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Security Violations) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn August 22, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe granted Applicant\u2019s\n\n2\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDepartment Counsel raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant had mitigated the Guideline K security concerns was based upon a piecemeal analysis\nand was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We affirm the decision of the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is a computer technician for a\ndefense contractor and has held a security clearance since 1990.  His duties include \u201cbeing custodian\nof the computer resource lab closed area (CRL), information security officer (ISSO) of a classified\ncomputer network in the CRL, and a backup systems administrator for various computer systems his\nemployer owned and operated.  He acquired these duties over time as other personnel departed the\ncompany and replacements were not hired.  Applicant worked in the CRL four to eight hours daily,\noften up to 10 hours daily when the workload was heavy.  He would enter and exist this secured area\nseveral times daily in the course of his duties.\u201d \n\u201cApplicant committed seven security violations between 1997 and 2005 during the course\nof his official duties for his employer.  Each violation was investigated by his employer.  Applicant\nwas retrained on security protocols after each violation.  Applicant also made procedural changes\nin his routine to prevent repeats of the individual violation types after each incident.  No compromise\nof classified material occurred as a result of any of Applicant\u2019s actions because the violations\noccurred in a secured and limited access area within the employer\u2019s facility, and the facility has\n\u2018security in depth\u2019 procedures.  As of February 2006 his company has reduced his workload by\nremoving and reassigning Applicant\u2019s former additional duties as main custodian for the CRL and\nISSO.  The company\u2019s chief security officer is confident that with these changes the possibility of\nfuture security violations are substantially eliminated.\u201d  (Citations omitted)\nApplicant\u2019s security violations included four incidents of failing to log off a classified\ncomputer system; a failure to engage the combination lock on the CRL door and to sign the log sheet\nupon departure; a failure properly to secure a computer disc classified at the secret level; and a\nfailure to secure a secret tape in the CRL server room.  His last incident consisted of a failure to log\noff the computer system.  Applicant\u2019s employer placed a sign prominently within the CRL asking,\n\u201cDid you log off?\u201d  Applicant has placed a chain across his cubicle entrance as a reminder, and he\ntriple checks his computers.  Furthermore, a guard is now called when the CRL is closed after the\nlast person departs.\nThe Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s security officials \u201cregard him as a conscientious employee\nwho takes his security responsibilities seriously.\u201d  In his Conclusions section, the Judge stated,\n\u201cApplicant is a very credible and honest witness whose explanations of the various situations were\ndirect and persuasive.\u201d    \n    \nB.  Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not at issue\nin this case. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion. In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the\nBoard will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive,\nor other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nBecause  the Department Counsel did not challenge the Judge\u2019s factual findings, they are\nbinding upon the Board in our analysis of the issue on appeal.  See ISCR Case No. 04-11369 at 2\n(App. Bd. Mar. 16, 2007) (\u201cThe Board may consider whether a Judge\u2019s factual findings are based\nupon substantial evidence, presuming that issue is raised.  Failing that, we rely on the findings as set\nforth in the decision\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 03-11765 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2005).  The issue\nbefore us is not whether we ourselves would have granted Applicant a clearance, since we do not\nreview cases de novo.  Rather, it is whether, in light of the Judge\u2019s unchallenged findings, his\ndecision is sustainable.\n  We acknowledge that there is much in the Judge\u2019s findings that would have supported the\nopposite decision, primarily the fact that Applicant committed seven security violations, not an\ninconsiderable number.  However, we also take note of the Judge\u2019s findings concerning the impact\nthat Applicant\u2019s workload had upon his mistakes; the inadvertent nature of the violations; the\nemployer\u2019s decision to assign some of Applicant\u2019s responsibilities to others; the employer\u2019s belief\n\nRegarding  Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge addressed the case in a piecemeal fashion, we\n1\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements of Directive  \u00b6  E2.2.1, in that the Judge\nconsidered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.  See ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May\n19, 2006). \n4\nthat these changes will eliminate the possibility of future violations; and steps Applicant has taken\nto ensure his compliance with security procedures.  We also note the Judge\u2019s evaluation of Applicant\nas a believable and honest witness in his own behalf.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 (\u201c[T]he Appeal\nBoard shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge.\u201d); see also\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 9 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  In light of this, we conclude that, given the\nrecord before him, the Judge has articulated a rational explanation for his favorable decision.  An\nappealing party\u2019s disagreement with a Judge\u2019s decision is not a sufficient basis to establish that he\nerred.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 01-05912 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2001).    The Board concludes that\n1\nthe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, given\nthe totality of facts and circumstances in this case.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSee Dissenting Opinion           \nJeffrey D. Billett\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin          \nJean E. Smallin\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E. Moody           \nJames E Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE JEFFREY D. BILLETT\nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s favorable security decision should be reversed.  While I do not\nsubscribe to Department Counsel\u2019s theory that the Judge engaged in a piecemeal analysis of the case,\nI do think that the Judge erred when he analyzed the evidence in mitigation outside the context of\nthe considerable amount of evidence that forms the basis for the government\u2019s security concerns.\n\n5\nI  agree fully with Department Counsel\u2019s larger point that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity violations have been mitigated cannot be sustained.\nApplicant committed seven security violations at his workplace over an eight year period\nbetween 1997 and 2005.  Additionally, in 2005 Applicant was responsible for a breach of physical\nsecurity involving alarms at his workplace that was later determined not to be a security violation\nunder the terms of the NISPOM.  After each security violation, Applicant was \u201cre-briefed\u201d and steps\nwere taken to ensure he understood his security responsibilities.  However, repeated remedial actions\ndid not prevent the commission of multiple additional violations.  During the period that the\nviolations took place, Applicant was the Information Systems Security Officer and the Custodian of\nthe Computer Resource Lab, positions that required him to spend considerable time maintaining\nsecurity.  In February 2006, the same month as the hearing in this case, Applicant was relieved of\nhis duties as the Information Systems Security Officer and Custodian of the Computer Resource Lab.\nSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access\nto classified information, as they raise very serious questions about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3-4 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998).  Once it\nis established that Applicant has committed a security violation, he has \u201ca very heavy burden of\ndemonstrating that [he] should be entrusted with classified information.  Because security violations\nstrike at the very heart of the industrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any\nclaims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 7 (App. Bd. Sept. 20,\n2001).  In many security clearance cases, applicants are denied a clearance for having an indicator\nof risk that they might commit a security violation in the future (e.g., alcohol abuse, drug use, or\ndelinquent debts).  In this case, there is more than the presence of an indicator.  The Judge found\nApplicant repeatedly disregarded in-place security procedures in violation of the NISPOM.  The\nfrequency and duration of Applicant\u2019s security violations are aggravating factors.  ISCR Case No.\n97-0435 at  5 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998.)\nGiven these standards and the totality of the record evidence in the case, the matters in\nmitigation cited by the Judge are insufficient to sustain his overall favorable security clearance\ndetermination.  The Judge makes much of the fact that Applicant\u2019s security violations were not\ndeliberate but were due to oversight and were unintentional.  However, the Board has held that\nsecurity violations are a serious matter, whether they are the result of deliberate or negligent conduct.\nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting classified information from disclosure to\nunauthorized persons, regardless of whether such disclosure is the result of deliberate or negligent\nconduct.  ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 6 (App. Bd. Sept. 20, 2001).  In a case like this one, where there\nare numerous violations, the fact the violations were inadvertent or the result of oversight is of\nlimited value in mitigation.\nIn his \u201cConclusions\u201d section when discussing matters in mitigation, the Judge also mentions\nthat there was never a compromise of classified information and all of Applicant\u2019s violations\noccurred within a secure area.  To consider the lack of compromise a matter in mitigation was clear\nerror.  The negative security implications of Applicant\u2019s history of security violations are not reduced\nor diminished by the fact that no compromise of classified information occurred.  See, e.g., DISCR\nCase No. 89-1397 at 7 (App. Bd. Sept. 25, 1997)(\u201cThe absence of any compromise of classified\ninformation may be a fortunate circumstance, but it does not diminish the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s\nmultiple security violations over a period of years.\u201d); DISCR Case No. 88-2773 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.\n\n6\n30, 1990)(\u201cApplicant\u2019s pattern of negligent or careless security violations is not rendered any less\nserious or problematic by the purely fortuitous circumstance that none of them resulted in a\ncompromise of national security\u201d).       \nThe Judge found that in February 2006 Applicant\u2019s company reduced his workload by\nremoving his previous responsibilities for maintaining security in the hopes of substantially\neliminating the possibility of future security violations.  The Judge cited this change as a matter in\nmitigation.  However, the change occurred, at most, two or three weeks prior to the hearing in the\ncase.  The lack of ability to evaluate whether the change has had the salutary results Applicant\u2019s\nsuperiors were hoping for significantly undercuts the mitigating effect of this evidence.  \nThe Judge cited as another factor in mitigation the fact that Applicant displays a positive\nattitude toward his security responsibilities by various remedial actions he instituted himself to\nprevent security violations, including his \u201crebriefs\u201d on security.  However, as pointed out by\nDepartment Counsel, on at least one occasion a remedial measure instituted and undertaken by\nApplicant failed to prevent a subsequent security violation.  Numerous \u201crebriefs\u201d undergone by\nApplicant also failed to forestall subsequent violations.  Omitting these facts in an analysis of\nApplicant\u2019s display of a positive security attitude reduces the analysis to an assessment of mere good\nintentions.  By ignoring Applicant\u2019s unsuccessful attempts at reform and rehabilitation, the Judge\nhas not employed the strict scrutiny required when evaluating claims of reform and rehabilitation in\nsecurity violation cases.  Moreover, by not reviewing evidence of reform and rehabilitation in light\nof Applicant\u2019s subsequent violations after reforms and rehabilitation were instituted, the Judge erred\nby not considering an important aspect of the case.   \n \nThe Judge gave considerable weight to the assessment of Applicant\u2019s superiors and his\nsecurity managers regarding Applicant\u2019s conscientiousness and high integrity.  The Judge also gave\nweight to the fact that Applicant was a very credible and honest witness \u201cwhose explanations of the\nvarious situations were direct and persuasive.\u201d  The willingness of Applicant\u2019s superiors to vouch\nfor his trustworthiness and integrity must be considered in light of Applicant\u2019s long history of\nsecurity violations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).  Applicant\u2019s\npersonal trustworthiness and credibility has not prevented him from committing many security\nviolations over a period of years.  The Judge\u2019s failure to address this issue and his failure to evaluate\nthis evidence in the context of the totality of the record evidence is error. \nGiven the totality of the record evidence, and given the high mitigation burden necessary to\novercome seven prior security violations, the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of mitigation and\nreform and rehabilitation sufficient to overcome the negative implications of Applicant\u2019s long history\nof security violations are not sustainable.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.a. See\nLauvik v. INS, 910 F.2d 658, 660 (9th Cir. 1990)(\u201cthere is some point at which the evidence, though\nit exists, becomes so slight and so thoroughly outweighed by contrary evidence, that it would be an\nabuse of discretion to base a decision upon it.\u201d)(cited in DISCR Case No. 92-0404 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMay 25, 1993)).

Hess, Esquire\nFor Applicant: David F. Chalela, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn September 27, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its denial of Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance. Specifically, it alleged facts which raise concerns under\nGuidelines E, Personal Conduct, and D, Sexual Behavior. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 21, 2005, initially requested a hearing,\nand the case was assigned to another administrative judge. While the hearing was\npending, Applicant suffered a light stroke, and his doctor recommended that he not\nattend the hearing. Subsequently, Applicant requested an administrative determination.\nOn March 13, 2008, the government prepared a File of Relevant Materials (FORM).\nJune 9, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant, through counsel, replied on April 30, 2008, and the case was assigned to me\non May 16, 2008. Based upon a review of the FORM, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nRuling of Evidence\nItem 9 of the FORM is a U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) case file.\nIt includes an investigative report prepared by Applicant\u2019s then-employer containing,\namong other things, several adverse witness statements regarding the issue of whether\nApplicant, between 1996 and 1997, violated his then-employer\u2019s sexual harassment\npolicy. In Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer, he admits being accused of sexual harassment in\n1997, but \u201cdenied the conduct that was the basis of the agency\u2019s action.\u201d \nWith the exception of two rare circumstances, neither of which apply here,\ncontroverted, adverse witness statements are inadmissible (Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.22).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the doctrine of collateral estoppel compels both the\nadmissibility of the entire MSPB file, and a finding that the underlying conduct occurred.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s appeal of the sexual harassment case before the MSPB settled\nbefore a final judgment was entered. Absent a final judgment in the MSPB case, the\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel is not applicable (Coffey v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,\n961 F. 2d 922 (C.A. 10 (Colo.), 1992).\nThe DOHA process is designed to encourage judges to initially admit contested\nevidence into the record, then consider the party\u2019s objections when deciding what, if\nany, weight to give that evidence (ISCR Case No. 04-12449 (App. Bd., May 14, 2007)).\nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s counsel, in his Reply, did not object to the witness statements\u2019\nadmissibility. Consequently, I have admitted the entire MSPB file, but have given the\nencapsulated witness statements minimal weight in reaching my decision. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 64-year-old man who has worked as a senior acquisitions analyst\nfor various defense contractors for the past nine years. Before working in the private\nsector, he had worked in the federal government for the previous 19 years. He has\nworked on programs involving, among other things, aircraft acquisitions and\nintelligence. Typically, his work has focused on budgetary, legal, and technical issues.\nHis educational background is unknown from the record. A current coworker describes\nhim as \u201ctrustworthy, honest, and reliable\u201d (Reference Letter dated April 16, 2008, as\nincluded in Reply).\nApplicant is highly active in his community, often organizing neighborhood\ngarage sales and community fairs (Reference letter from neighbor, undated, as listed in\nReply at 7). Many neighbors often seek his advice on personal matters (Id.).\nApplicant has been married for 20 years. Between March and May of 1992,\nApplicant touched a woman who worked in his building \u201cin a manner that was\n\n3\nunwarranted and unwelcome, and . . . made comments of a sexual nature to the same\nemployee that were unwarranted and unwelcome\u201d (Item 6 at 6). The woman filed a\ncomplaint, and Applicant was subsequently administratively charged with conduct\nunbecoming a federal employee (Item 6 at 4). He was then suspended for three days,\nordered to attend weekly therapy, and to provide progress reports of his treatment to his\nemploying agency\u2019s deciding official (Id.).He completed the treatment, as ordered (Item\n9 at 147).\nThree months before this incident, Applicant had attended a general training on\nsexual harassment prevention (Item 6 at 4).\nIn March 1997, a female coworker accused Applicant of a pattern of unwanted\nphysical contact and sexual advances including, among other things, visiting her\napartment to demand sexual intercourse (Item 9 at 49). This prompted the agency to\nappoint an investigative officer to conduct an informal investigation (Item 9 at 46, 70). In\nMarch 1997, the investigator interviewed both Applicant and his accuser, who gave their\ntestimonies under oath (Item 9 at 72 - 150). A court reporter provided a certified\ntranscription of both interviews (Item 9 at 151). Applicant\u2019s attorney was present at his\ninterview. Also, the investigator interviewed 16 other witnesses and coworkers over a\ntwo-month period. Each provided signed, sworn statements. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s interview, he stated that he never had physical contact with\nthe coworker that he initiated (Item 9 at 123). Also, he acknowledged visiting her at her\napartment, but asserted that he did so only to help her repair a toilet (Item 9 at 120).\nLater during the interview, he stated he had never been in contact with the coworker\nanywhere other than the office (Item 9 at 148 -149). \nAfter the investigation was completed, a senior agency official reviewed it, and on\nJune 10, 2007, concluded that the accuser\u2019s allegations were substantiated, and\nrecommended that Applicant\u2019s employment be terminated (Item 9 at 197).\nSubsequently, Applicant was fired.\nOn November 18, 1997, Applicant appealed the decision to the U.S. Merit\nSystems Protection Board (MSPB). On January 28, 1998, while the appeal was\npending, the parties reached an agreement to settle the case (See Item 9 at 234-238).\nUnder the agreement, the agency agreed to reinstate Applicant\u2019s position through\nMarch 17, 2000. Also, the agency agreed to characterize the period between\nApplicant\u2019s release following the investigation and the settlement as a suspension rather\nthan a termination. In exchange, Applicant \u201cvoluntarily and irrevocably agre[ed] to apply\nfor and accept a discontinued service retirement on March 17, 2000 . . .\u201d (Item 9 at 235).\nAlso, the agreement prohibited Applicant from contacting any federal employees unless\ninstructed, and it restricted him to working from home. He was not entitled to any\n\u201cwithin-grade step increases\u201d during the reinstatement period, and he was not to be paid\nif no work-at-home assignments were available. Once Applicant retired, he was not to\nseek any employment that would require personal contact with federal government\nemployees within the agency where he had worked.\n\n4\nOn April 4, 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance application. He\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to Question 20 (Your Employment Record - Has any of the\nfollowing happened to you in the past 7 years? - Fired from job - Quit a job after being\ntold you\u2019d be fired - Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct -\nLeft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance -\nLeft a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances). He contends the\ncircumstances of his departure were not adverse because he worked for two years after\nthe settlement agreement, and did not retire until the agency abolished the position\n(Answer at 2).\nDuring the security clearance investigative process, a Defense Security Services\n(DSS) investigator interviewed him about the 1997 sexual harassment allegations. He\ndenied sexually harassing the coworker, but acknowledged visiting her twice at her\napartment and having consensual sexual intercourse with her on each occasion (Item\n10 at 2).\nIn his Answer, Applicant states that he learned from the 1993 experience, and\nhas not engaged in any inappropriate workplace behavior since then. He does not\nconsider the 1996 affair to constitute such behavior \u201cbecause it did not occur in the\nworkplace\u201d (Item 3 at 3).\nApplicant also revealed to the DSS investigator another incident involving a\nformer coworker that prompted a sexual harassment complaint. It occurred while on\nbusiness travel when Applicant, while in the coworker\u2019s hotel room retrieving notes from\na meeting earlier that day, pushed her to the bed \u201cin a playful fashion\u201d (Item 10 at 3).\nAlthough it occurred before the March 1997 allegation, the exact date is unclear from\nthe record.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours. The government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b615). Here, Applicant engaged in extramarital sexual intercourse with a\ncoworker who later accused him of a pattern of sexual harassment. This occurred four\nyears after the same employer had disciplined him for sexually harassing another\nemployee, and required him to attend six weeks of counseling. AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . .,\u201d\napplies.\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application, he omitted the\nrelationship between the 1997 sexual harassment allegations and the 2000 job\ndeparture from his security clearance application in response to Question 20. This\nraises the issue of whether AG \u00b616(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\n\n6\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. Applicant contends that he\ndid not leave the job under adverse circumstances because he was reinstated after\nnegotiating a settlement agreement, and worked for another two years before retiring.\nAfter reviewing the settlement agreement and the multiple contradictory explanations he\nprovided throughout both the sexual harassment investigatory process and the security\nclearance investigatory process about his relationship with the coworker who filed the\n1997 complaint, I conclude that his security clearance application omission constitutes\nan intentional falsification. AG \u00b6\u00b616(a) and 16(e) apply without mitigation. Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the personal conduct security concern.\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nApplicant went to a general sexual harassment training three months before\nsexually harassing a coworker in 1993. After being disciplined for the 1993 incident, he\nattended six weeks of counseling. Approximately four years later, he had an\nextramarital affair with a coworker who later accused him of sexual harassment. The\nrecurrent nature of this sexual misconduct also generates security concerns under the\nsexual behavior guideline, as defined in its introductory paragraph as follows:\nThe Concern: Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion,\nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG \u00b612).\nSpecifically, the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b613(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes\nan individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201c and 13(d), \u201csexual\nbehavior . . that reflects lack of discretion or judgment,\u201d apply.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\u2019s\nmost recent episode of sexual misconduct with coworkers occurred more than 10 years\nago, and there is no record evidence of any such behavior since then. He has\nsomewhat minimized the vulnerability to coercion by disclosing the 1997 extramarital\naffair to his wife. However, the sexual misconduct was repetitive, and at least one\nrecurrence occurred after attending six weeks of counseling. I was particularly troubled\nby his belief set forth in his Answer that the 1997 extramarital affair with a coworker did\nnot constitute inappropriate workplace behavior because it occurred at her apartment\nrather than on the job. The remoteness of the sexual misconduct is outweighed by the\nabsence of rehabilitation. Applicant has failed to mitigate the sexual behavior security\nconcern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\n\n7\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI have addressed the whole person factors in the Personal Conduct and Sexual\nBehavior sections of the Decision. Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility and his repeated lapses\nin judgment render him an unacceptable security risk. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: The FORM contains very little information about Applicant or the offenses of which he was convicted. However, the following can be gleamed from the FORM. Applicant is a 59-year-old high school drop out. He has been employed as a truck driver and or owner-driver since at least 1996. Before becoming a truck driver, Applicant worked on off shore oil rigs and in overseas oil fields Applicant was first married in May 1975. He has four adult children from that marriage. That marriage ended in divorce in either 1999 or March 2000. Applicant attributes the breakup of this marriage to his being away from home on work for long periods of time. He remarried in December 2000, and now works as a truck driving team with his wife. He has two adult step-children from his second marriage. Form, Item 2. 2 3 Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in October 1999, and apparently received a discharge sometime thereafter.

He was\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as\n1\namended and modified (Directive).\n2\nsentenced to serve penitentiary sentences ranging from one year and one day to five years and was\nactually confined for approximately two years. Although he would otherwise be able to mitigate the\nsecurity concern created by his criminal conduct, he is prohibited from doing so because of the\nstatutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR, which is in\n1\nessence the administrative complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline J for criminal\nconduct. The SOR also alleges 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 disqualifies Applicant from having a security\nclearance granted or renewed. Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR, dated September 11,\n2006. He admitted all Guideline J allegations, did not respond to the allegation that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986\napplied to his case, and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 11, 2007, that\nwas mailed to Applicant on April 16, 2007. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on May\n10, 2007. He thereafter did not object to anything contained in the FORM or submit additional\ninformation for consideration within the 30-day period provided to him. The case was assigned to\nme on August 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of\nfact:\nThe FORM contains very little information about Applicant or the offenses of which he was\nconvicted. However, the following can be gleamed from the FORM. Applicant is a 59-year-old high\nschool drop out. He has been employed as a truck driver and or owner-driver since at least 1996.\nBefore becoming a truck driver, Applicant worked on off shore oil rigs and in overseas oil fields\nApplicant was first married in May 1975. He has four adult children from that marriage. That\nmarriage ended in divorce in either 1999 or March 2000. Applicant attributes the breakup of this\nmarriage to his being away from home on work for long periods of time. He remarried in December\n2000, and now works as a truck driving team with his wife. He has two adult step-children from his\nsecond marriage. \n\n Form, Item 2.\n2\n3\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in October 1999, and apparently received\na discharge sometime thereafter. He attributes the bankruptcy to the dissolution of his first marriage\nand his inability to handle his debts with the loss of his wife\u2019s income. \nApplicant was convicted of three counts of forgery in a state court on January 1971, and\nsentenced to one year and one day incarceration on one count, two years incarceration on the second\ncount, and five years incarceration on the third count. He was convicted of transporting and receiving\nstolen goods in a federal court in January 1971, and sentenced to three years incarceration to be\nserved in a state penitentiary. He was convicted of forging and uttering a U.S. Treasury check in\nMarch 1971, and sentenced to three years incarceration to be served in a state penitentiary. Lastly,\nhe was convicted of mail fraud and aiding and abetting mail fraud in May 1971, and sentenced to\ntwo years incarceration to be served in a state penitentiary.\nApplicant pled guilty to all offenses of which he was incarcerated. The record in silent as to\nwhy the various federal convictions occurred on different dates, but it is clear he remained in custody\nat all times following his first conviction in state court and that all offenses occurred prior to the time\nhe was originally arrested. \nApplicant attributes the entire series of criminal incidents to youthful indiscretion. His\ndescription of each event that resulted in a criminal conviction indicates they were non-violent\noffenses that involved relatively small amounts of money used to provide for his transportation and\nsupport while he bummed around several states while a young man. He served approximately two\nyears and possibly as much as two and one-half years in jail for the various convictions with the\nsentences all being served concurrently. Upon being released from the penitentiary, Applicant\ndecided \u201cI wanted to be a better person than I had been up to that time, so I vowed to myself that it\nwould never happen again.\u201d  There is no indication he has committed any offense, other than minor\n2\ntraffic violations, since being released from the penitentiary in March 1973. \n       \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and\nMitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the\nDirective. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline\nJ, pertaining to criminal conduct, with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions is most relevant\nin this case.   \nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd.

The government has\n3\nthe burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\n4\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence , although the government is required to present\n5\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\n6\nless than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden\n7\nshifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the\ncase against him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n8\nfavorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n10\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n11\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\nrecognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be\nadjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound\njudgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nUnder Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of\ncriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nWillingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation\u2019s\n\n5\nsecrets. By its very nature, criminal conduct calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J. In 1971, he was\nconvicted of numerous offenses in both state and federal courts. He was sentenced to terms of\nimprisonment ranging from one year and one day to five years. He actually served somewhere\nbetween about two years and two and one-half years before being released from custody.\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 31(a): A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and DC\n31(f): conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime, sentenced to\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less\nthan one year apply.\nApplicant has not been arrested or charged with any offense, other than minor traffic\nviolations, since his 1971 convictions. He has maintained a steady work history since being released\nfrom custody in 1973. He was married for almost 25 years and raised four children before being\ndivorced as a result of his extended absences from home for work purposes. In his response to the\nSOR, Applicant indicates he is a trusted employee who has earned the right with his current wife to\nhaul sensitive and high value cargo. The totality of evidence strongly indicates Applicant has been\ncompletely rehabilitated since his youthful criminal conduct and it is highly unlikely any similar\nconduct will ever again occur. I find Mitigating Conditions (MC) 32(a): so much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior . . . it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 32(d): There is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity . . . (and) good employment record applicable. \nApplicant would be able to mitigate the security concern that arises from his 1971 criminal\nconviction but for the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. Accordingly, while I\nfind SOR subparagraph 1.a. through 1.e for Applicant, I have no discretion in the matter and am\nrequired to find subparagraph 1.f. against him. Guideline J is decided against Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a-e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\n\n6\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July\n1\n12, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be granted or revoked.\nBy letter dated December 6, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested\na hearing on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 18, 2006, he elected to have an in-\nperson hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 24, 2007. On February 5, 2007, Applicant\u2019s\nattorney filed a Notice of Appearance. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 16, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for March 8, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing,\nthe Government offered four exhibits, Exs. 1-4. Applicant offered five exhibits, Exs. A-E. All\nexhibits were admitted into the record without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March\n19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegation under Guideline D, sexual behavior, subparagraph 1.a.\nApplicant\u2019s admission to the allegation in the SOR is incorporated herein. He denied the other\nallegations. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 42 years old and, since July 2000, has been a senior engineer for a defense\ncontractor.

He was divorced in October 2006.\n\nTr. 56.\n6\nTr. 41.\n7\nTr. 33.\n8\nSee Applicant\u2019s letter, dated December 6, 2005.\n9\nTr. 26.\n10\nTr. 35.\n11\n4\nIn 1993, while stationed overseas, Applicant was accused of fondling and inappropriately\ntouching his 12-year-old stepdaughter on her breasts, buttocks, and vagina, for sexual gratification.\nThis inappropriate behavior occurred approximately eight times, over a three- to four-month period.\nAt the time, his stepdaughter told her 10-year-old brother.  She then told her teacher, and the teacher\n6\ninformed their mother about the incident.\nThe Criminal Investigator Division (CID) of the Army questioned Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter\nand wife about the molestation allegations. Applicant testified that when questioned, his wife and\ndaughter recanted their allegations.  After CID investigated, Applicant and his family were advised\n7\nto attend counseling regarding the sexual molestation matter. They attended approximately four, one-\nhour sessions.\nApplicant further testified that his commanding officer questioned him about the molestation\nincident:\nQ:\nAnd you initially denied this [molestation allegation] to your commander?\nA:\nI did, to protect my children.\nQ:\nHow is it that denying this would protect your children?\nA:\nMy family is very important to me, and at that time we, you know, we had made the\ndecision to put this past us and move on.\nQ:\nDid you later admit this to your commander?\nA:\nNo I did not.\nQ:\nWhy not?\nA:\nI don\u2019t know.8\nIn Applicant\u2019s SF 86, executed on June 19, 1997, he replied \u201cno\u201d to question 19 (Your\nmedical Record  In the last 7 years, have you consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist,\npsychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with another health care provider about a\nmental health related condition). He failed to list that he attended counseling at the Family Services\nCenter regarding the sexual molestation charge. He indicated that \u201c[t]he omission of the Counseling\nsession was in no way an attempt to hide the counseling session.\u201d  He testified that he did not list\n9\nthe family counseling because \u201cI didn\u2019t believe that was relevant.\u201d  He recalled that there were\n10\napproximately four, one-hour  counseling sessions, attended by himself, his wife, and stepdaughter.11\nIn response to question 9 on the 1997 SF 86 (Your Relatives and Associates  Entry List\nOptions: 1.

He failed to list\nhis two daughters, two stepdaughters, and stepson. He indicated that failure to list his children was\nnot intentional.\nIn a subsequent SF 86 electronically submitted on April 9, 2002, in response to question 9\n(same question as the 1997 SF 86), he listed his mother, father, and sister. He failed to list his two\ndaughters, his two stepdaughters, his stepson, and his brother. He indicated that failure to list his\nchildren was not intentional.\nApplicant had a polygraph examination in April 2003, where he fully disclosed and admitted\nthe allegations regarding molesting his stepdaughter.  Applicant\u2019s security clearance and access to\n12\nSensitive Compartment Information (SCI) were denied by another Government Agency, on April\n9, 2003, as a result of his molestation of his 12-year-old stepdaughter in about 1993. Applicant\nfurther testified that after the polygraph, he had a family meeting and disclosed the sexual\nmolestation incident to the entire family.  Applicant contends that the CID did not question him\n13\nabout the molestation. He stated: \nI understand that I was to blame for the entire incident and would have been punished\nif questioned by Military Police or CID. Looking back at my decision to disclose this\ninformation to the polygraph examiner was entirely voluntary but as of this hearing\nmay prove to be the reason why I lose my clearance. Any Miliary Police (MP) or\nCentral Intelligence Division (CID) had not questioned me regarding this incident\nprior to the NSA Polygraph examiner.14\nAs a civilian, Applicant stated that he received multiple commendations from the Department\nof Energy and the Department of Defense for his engineering contributions to certain programs.15\nHe has received recognition from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for \u201cimplementing their\nsecurity systems and employing their hardware and troubleshooting their networks to maintain the\nlevel of protection that they require.\u201d  He was also recognized by two foreign governments for his\n16\nexpertise in engineering.17\n\nTr. 29.\n18\nEx.

He\nstated that they knew about the underlying molestation issue.  None of the letters mention the\n19\nmolestation issue.

One letter indicated that: \u201c[Applicant] has been a stellar performer here from the very\nbeginning of his employment.\u201d  Another letter stated: \u201cI can state without reservation that\n20\n[Applicant] is one of the most trustworthy, professional, and dedicated members I have ever worked\nwith at my nine years at [place of employment].\u201d  Applicant was held in high esteem by his\n21\ncoworkers.22\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n25\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n27\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n28\nId.\n29\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n30\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n31\n7\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n25\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.26\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.27\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n28\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n29\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n30\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n31\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nSexual Behavior\nSexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality\nor emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack\nof judgment or discretion. The Government has established a prima facie case for disqualification\nunder Guideline D, sexual behavior.\nApplicant is a sexual predator. He admitted fondling and inappropriately touching his 12-year-\nold stepdaughter on her breasts, buttocks and vagina, for his sexual gratification. This inappropriate\nbehavior occurred approximately eight times in a three- to four-month period in about 1993. Moreover,\nCID investigated the incidents shortly after it was reported in 1993. He contends that his family\nrecanted their charges, and he, his wife, and daughter were ordered to go to family counseling. He\ndenied the allegations when questioned by his commanding officer. Moreover, he contends that neither\nthe CID nor military police questioned him about the accusations. Because of his actions toward his\n\n8\nstepdaughter, Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Conditions (SB DC) E2.A4.1.2.1 (sexual behavior of a\ncriminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted), SB DC E2.A4.1.2.2 (compulsive\nor addictive sexual behavior when the person is unable to stop a pattern of self-destructive or high-\nrisk behavior or that which is symptomatic of a personality disorder), and SB DC E2.A4.1.2.3 (sexual\nbehavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate sexual behavior security concerns. Sexual abuse of a child is\nregarded very negatively in our society and is a cowardly act. Here, if an individual became aware of\nApplicant\u2019s sexual exploitation of a child, that information could be used to pressure the Applicant to\ndo things that were not in the interest of the U.S. government. Obviously, his sexual molestation of\na minor child reflects a lack of discretion or judgment. The sexual molestation charge at issue,\nhowever, was not recent. It occurred more than 13 years ago. There is no evidence of child molestation\nsubsequent to 1993. Thus, Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition E2.A4.1.3.2 (the behavior was not\nrecent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature) applies. However, because\nof the embarrassing nature of this incident, together with the fact that he actively concealed this\nheinous act until 2003, continues to make Applicant vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, and duress,\nby someone who could use this incident to have an advantage over Applicant. Applicant has divulged\nhis inappropriate sexual behavior to a limited number of select people. Thus, none of the other Sexual\nBehavior Mitigating Conditions apply. Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s case.\nAccordingly, allegations 1.a and 1.b of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question whether the\nperson\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified\ninformation. The Government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline\nE, personal conduct.\nWhen questioned in 1993 by his commanding officer about the sexual molestation of his 12-\nyear-old stepdaughter, Applicant denied the allegations. His wife and stepdaughter recanted their\nallegations. Applicant, his wife and daughter attended family counseling. However, he failed to\nindicate the family counseling activity on his SF 86. Moreover, in SF 86s executed in 1997 and 2002,\nhe failed to list any of his five children. I conclude Applicant deliberately falsified questions in both\nSF 86s. Additionally, his access to SCI was denied on April 9, 2003, as a result of the sexual\nmolestation charges. For more than 10 years, from 1993 when the incident occurred to 2003 when he\nfinally acknowledged his egregious behavior, he has lied about material facts. The truth could have\ndestroyed his military career. Rather than deal with the consequences, he has lived his life with the\nhope that his secrets would remain just that. Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC\nDC) E2.A5.1.2.1 (reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers,\nneighbors, and other acquaintances), PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities), PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3 (deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official representative in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination), PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (personal\nconduct or concealment of information that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion,\nexploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\n\n9\npersonal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail), and PC\nDC E2.A5.1.2.5 (a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or\nrecorded agreement made between the individual and the agency) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate personal conduct security concerns. Honesty is critical to a\nposition of trust in safeguarding classified information. The individual is obligated to come forward\nand self-report any security violation. Beginning in 1993, Applicant committed a number of\nfalsifications. He denied the sexual molestation allegations initially to his commanding officer.\nMoreover, it was not until the polygraph examination in 2003 that Applicant fully divulged this\ninformation as part of security clearance investigation process. Thus, Personal Conduct Mitigating\nConditions (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.1 (the information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a\ndetermination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability), PC MC E2.A5.1.3.2 (the falsification was\nan isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information\nvoluntarily), and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts) do not apply. Applicant has not mitigated the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegations 2.a through 2.f of the SOR are concluded against\nApplicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. At the\nhearing, Applicant appeared composed, contrite, and remorseful for his sexual advances toward his\n12-year-old stepdaughter. He was a sexual predator, and he molested his stepdaughter. Once the family\nreported his behavior, he lied to his commanding officer and denied the allegations. He deliberately\nfalsified material facts in two different SF 86s, by omitting all of his children, hoping that if an\ninvestigation occurred, his children would not be interviewed. Moreover, he lost access to SCI, which\nis a further indication that he is not trustworthy or reliable. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant\nis not suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline D (Sexual Behavior):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

Recurrence is unlikely since they are now divorced. In January 2003,\nApplicant checked onto an airline carrier a test bag containing simulated firearm and explosive\ndevices without first disclosing the contents of the bag, and he interfered with the performance of\na security screener. He was placed on pretrial probation on a criminal charge of possession of a hoax\ndevice and assessed civil fines for violating federal regulations. Criminal Conduct and Personal\nConduct concerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on April 14, 2005, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Applicant answered the SOR\non May 3, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned\nto me on February 2, 2007.  On February 21, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for May 2, 2007, to\n1\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.\nAt the hearing, 36 (Ex. 1-8, 10-37) of the 37 exhibits offered by the government were\nadmitted. Applicant objected to proposed exhibit 9 only, and the document was not admitted due to\nauthentication problems. Ten Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-J) were admitted.  Testimony was taken\n2\nfrom one government witness, a security manager of the Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA), and from Applicant and Applicant\u2019s supervisor on Applicant\u2019s behalf. At the government\u2019s\nrequest, I agreed to take administrative notice of two state statutes making punishable as a criminal\noffense possession of a hoax device and possession of an infernal machine; of three federal\nregulations concerning civil aviation security; and of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46301, which sets forth the civil\npenalties for violating aviation security regulations. A transcript of the hearing was received on May\n11, 2007.\nOn June 5, 2007, Applicant submitted a court document to confirm that the criminal matter\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d had been dismissed at the recommendation of the probation department. There\nbeing no objection, the record was reopened and the document was marked and admitted as\nApplicant Exhibit K.\n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant was arrested for threatening to commit a\ncrime and assault and battery in October 1992 (\u00b6 1.a), for assault and battery in January 1994 (\u00b6 1.b),\nand for domestic assault in about 1998 (\u00b6 1.c), all charges dismissed, and that Applicant was charged\ncriminally on January 22, 2003, in state court and sentenced to pretrial probation on a charge of\nfelony possession/transport of a hoax device (\u00b6 1.d). The underlying conduct that led to the felony\ncharge was alleged separately under Guideline E, to wit: Applicant checked an x-ray test suitcase\ncontaining representative explosive devices and a simulated pistol silhouette into airport baggage\non January 16, 2003, without declaring its contents to appropriate personnel (\u00b6 2.a). DOHA\nseparately alleged under Guideline E (\u00b6 2.b) that he had been cited by the TSA for three violations\nof federal regulations of aviation security: attempting to circumvent or cause a person to tamper or\ninterfere with a security system, transporting or offering for transport in checked baggage any\nunauthorized explosive or incendiary, and prohibition against interfering with screening personnel.\nApplicant was alleged to have settled the first two charges on payment of a $2,200 civil penalty, and\nto have been penalized $1,100 by the TSA for interfering with screening personnel at the airport.\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted he had been arrested as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b, which\narose out of marital disputes between him and his ex-wife. He denied any recall of the incident in\n\u00b6 1.c, although indicated it was likely part of his ex-wife\u2019s pattern of calling the police when they\nhad an argument. As for the incident involving the checked baggage at the airport in January 2003,\nApplicant admitted the felony criminal charge and pretrial probation as alleged in \u00b6 1.a, that he\npresented luggage to be checked at an airline carrier\u2019s ticket counter on January 16, 2003, without\ndeclaring the contents, which were materials used for the certain testing of equipment manufactured\nby his employer (\u00b6 2.a), and that he entered into a settlement agreement with the TSA in July 2004\n\u201cto avoid costly and protracted litigation,\u201d but he believed he would have been found not responsible\nhad he went to trial.\nAfter consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 63-year-old vice president for a defense firm (company A) that manufactures\ndetection equipment for military and civilian use. He started with the company in April 1981 as a\nmedical salesman. About five years later, the company shifted its focus to security, and by the early\n1990s, Applicant had been promoted to vice president in charge of business development. His\nprimary duties are to consult with and educate primarily the government about detection technologies\nand systems developed to detect explosives as well as illegal drugs. The company\u2019s clients include\nthe branches of the U.S. military, various defense and intelligence agencies, the protective services,\nand other federal departments, as well as private industry. Applicant\u2019s work has led to extensive\nforeign travel in South America and the Middle East as well as frequent travel to Washington, D.C.\nHe has held a minimum of a secret-level clearance since September 1989. In April 2001, he was\ngiven a top-secret security clearance.\nApplicant and his spouse divorced in August 2000 after 29 years of marriage. They\nexperienced marital discord in the last decade of their relationship, and she filed assault and battery\nand threatening charges against Applicant on or about October 4, 1992, and assault and battery on\nJanuary 2, 1994. Applicant pleaded not guilty, and she dropped her complaints in both instances.\n\n4\nOn November 5, 2001, Applicant and company A\u2019s chief executive officer were interviewed\non cable television about company A\u2019s technology that enables the detection of items that reflect\nrather than absorb x-rays and are not easily recognizable with conventional penetrating or\ntransmission x-ray technology.  To illustrate a potential vulnerability in airport screening, which\nemployed conventional x-ray technology, Applicant presented a metallic suitcase, which he claimed\nhad been \u201call over the world with [him]\u201d without him being stopped, and contained  \u201ca real gun, a\nGlock 17, 9-mm weapon . . .  three pipe bombs that are simulated, and it also has a small quantity\nof Semtex.\u201d (Ex. 6, Ex. 7, Ex. 35) At his hearing, Applicant admitted he had a gun on him for the\ndemonstration on November 5, 2001, which was in company A\u2019s office, but denied he had ever\ntaken it on travel with him as it was illegal to carry the weapon out of the state. (Tr. 300-01)\nOn January 13, 2003, Applicant contacted the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA)\nand asked if he could use TSA equipment to test a new x-ray test object that his employer had\ncreated. He told a TSA assistant security inspector that he wanted to see what image the test object\nprojected on the screen. She informed him that the test could not be conducted in an operating\nenvironment, but that it could perhaps be done at the TSA training center in his area. She referred\nhim to TSA\u2019s public affairs office.\nBy facsimile on January 13, 2003, Applicant sent a letter to TSA public affairs requesting\nthat company A be permitted \u201cto image,  on one of [TSA\u2019s] new standard transmission X-ray\ninspection systems, a test object designed to assess the capabilities of X-ray system technology in\ngeneral.\u201d (Ex. 29). Public affairs approved Applicant\u2019s request for training purposes only, not in an\noperational airport environment, and a TSA training coordinator was directed on January 14, 2003,\nto make arrangements for the testing with Applicant. The TSA training coordinator was unsuccessful\nin his efforts to speak directly with Applicant.\nOn January 16, 2003, Applicant was scheduled to met with federal protective services\npersonnel in Washington, D.C. to test the functionality of x-ray equipment manufactured by\ncompany A that was deployed there. (See Ex. D) At around 0615 hours, he presented baggage for\ncheck-in at the airline ticket counter in the terminal where he was scheduled to depart at 0700 hours.\nApplicant checked into the cargo hold an aluminum case containing three test objects and some\nitems needed for business travel (clothing, shoes, and a travel razor). The test objects were a piece\nof Lucite (thermoplastic acrylic resin) cut in the shape of a gun and taped to a radio; a piece of Lucite\nsecreted inside a tape recorder designed to simulate pliable plastic explosives such as Semtex or C4;\nand two pipes made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) filled with sugar, taped together, and attached to\na third radio to simulate an explosive device such as a pipe bomb. The bag, secured by combination\nlock, was marked on the outside with company A\u2019s name and the identifier \u201cX-Ray Test Bag.\u201d It was\nneeded to assess the functionality of the x-ray inspection systems at his destination. Applicant did\nnot inform the airline ticket agent of the bag\u2019s contents. Nor did he present a letter that he possessed\nfrom company A\u2019s vice president for operations. In his letter, dated January 15, 2003, the vice\npresident identified Applicant, the nature of the company\u2019s business as a manufacturer of technically\nadvanced backscatter x-ray detection systems for security and customs applications, and that\nApplicant was carrying an x-ray test suitcase, described as follows:\nThe test suitcase contains a number of inert, harmless, non-functioning stimulants.\nThe stimulants include two (2) PVC filled tubes containing sugar, a non-functioning\nplastic gun silhouette cut from a piece of PVC plastic, and a rectangular PVC plastic\n\nApplicant testified the screener grabbed his wrist when he reached for the keys that were under his coat in the\n3\nbin in front of him (Tr. 276); that it was only then that he grabbed the screener\u2019s wrist \u201cby reflex.\u201d (Tr. 231) The screener\ndoes not indicate that he ever grabbed Applicant\u2019s wrist (\u201cI asked the passenger to put the jacket down and please have\na seat at which point the passenger grabed [sic] my wrist.\u201d Ex. 25). Yet the screener substantiated Applicant\u2019s account\nthat he was merely checking for his keys (\u201cThe passenger stated to me he wanted to know if his keys were in his coat.\u201d).\nPhotographs of the front, back, one side, and  top (including handle and lock) views of the bag were collectively\n4\nadmitted as Exhibit I. The metallic bag as pictured is marked on front and back sides with the company\u2019s name and\nidentified as \u201cX-Ray Test Bag.\u201d On the top above the lock it indicates \u201cLock 721.\u201d While this was apparently the\ncombination, Applicant was unable to state with certainty that \u201cLock 721\" was written on the bag as of January 16, 2003\n(Tr. 214).  \nThe final report signed by the lead TSA inspector (Ex. 27) indicates that Applicant was uncooperative with\n5\nthe police. The assistant inspector testified that Applicant, who had been reported as uncooperative by TSA screening\nmanagers, was calm when  he saw him interacting with the police. (Tr. 103, 121)\n5\nblock. All of the stimulants are concealed by electronic devices. In addition, the\nsuitcase also contains a three-pound harmless sheet of PVC plastic, which has been\nmolded into one wall of the suitcase. (Ex. 30)\nApplicant also had a picture with him of what the image of the contents should reveal. (Ex. 31) He\ndid not provide the picture to airline or security personnel when he checked in the test bag.\nApplicant departed the airline ticket counter and went to the appropriate security checkpoint\nin the terminal. He placed his property onto the x-ray machine, and then stepped through the metal\ndetector. Applicant was selected for secondary screening and asked to step aside. As the screener led\nApplicant to the area reserved for the screening, Applicant expressed his belief that the process was\n\u201ca joke.\u201d The screener, who had maintained control of the property Applicant had submitted for\nscreening, put Applicant\u2019s items down at a nearby table. Unable to locate his keys, Applicant picked\nup his coat to see if his keys were underneath. The screener asked Applicant to put the coat down.\nAs the screener reached for the coat, Applicant grabbed the screener\u2019s wrist and pushed it away.3\nApplicant told a supervisor who was called to the scene that he wanted to know if his keys were\ninside his coat, and he was allowed to proceed to the gate area.\nAt about 0615 hours, the test bag set off alarms while going through an explosive detection\nsystem for checked baggage. No traces of explosive were detected during a sample of the bag, but\nindications were of a semi-automatic, clip-fed pistol and multiple improved explosive devices in the\nbag. A TSA screening manager was summoned to the check baggage room and the airline was\ncontacted to obtain the combination to the locked bag.  Shortly after he provided the combination,\n4\nApplicant was approached in the gate area by the TSA screening manager, a TSA checkpoint\nsecurity supervisor, and the state police.  Applicant became agitated (\u201cI\u2019m sure there was some off\n5\ncolor speech but I can\u2019t recall what it was.\u201d Tr. 293), and then confrontational when the police asked\nhim about the contents of the bag. Applicant questioned why he should have had to disclose the\ncontents of the bag when he checked it in. It was only after the bag was examined by the police that\n\nIn the July 12, 2003 report of investigation (Ex. 27), the lead TSA inspector indicated that Applicant produced\n6\na copy of a letter dated June 24, 2002, signed by company A\u2019s vice president of operations that listed the contents of the\ntest kit. The letter that the assistant inspector testified he was given (Ex. 30) is dated January 15, 2003, one day before\nthe incident. Applicant\u2019s testimony was consistent with the assistant inspector\u2019s. The June 24, 2002, was an earlier\nversion that Applicant had previously carried with him. (Tr. 226-27)\nThe assistant inspector was an aviation security inspector technically employed by the Federal Aviation\n7\nAdministration at the time. (Tr. 100)\nThe statement of the assistant inspector (Ex. 37) contains no mention of the incident at the checkpoint, although\n8\nhe testified that he and the lead inspector created the report of interview signed on July 15, 2003 (Ex. 21). That report\nof interview indicates Applicant denied he attempted to interfere with or intimidate an airport screener that morning.\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 266 \u00a7102A1/2 provides in pertinent part:\n9\n(a) Whoever possesses, transports, uses or places or causes another to knowingly or unknowingly\npossess, transport, use or place any hoax device or hoax substance with the intent to cause anxiety,\nunrest, fear or personal discomfort to any person or group of persons shall be punished by\nimprisonment in a house of correction for not more than two and one-half years or by imprisonment\nin the state prison for not more than five years or by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by both such\nfine and imprisonment.\n(b) For purposes of this section, the term \u201choax device\u201d shall mean any device that would cause a\nperson reasonably to believe that such device is an infernal machine.

Applicant was not arrested,\n6\nbut the bag was confiscated by the state police.\nAt approximately 0745 hours, Applicant was interviewed by two TSA inspectors.7\nApplicant, who was cooperative during this interview, began by denying that he had been conducting\na test of any kind. He then handed them his business card and told them that he was in route to\nWashington, D.C. to meet with federal government personnel. Applicant pulled out x-ray images and\nproceeded to describe each image as it appeared in an x-ray by his company of the contents of the\nbag he had checked. Applicant admitted he had not told the airline of the contents of the checked\nbag, and stated that since no other passenger was required to reveal the contents of his baggage,\nneither was he. He averred he had traveled every month for several months with the same test\nsuitcase and it had not been an issue previously. Applicant asked the inspectors whether there was\nany way to avoid such a situation in the future.  It was suggested to him that he notify the air carrier\nthe day before and at check-in for travel. Applicant expressed his belief that such coordination was\ntoo much to do and would probably have the same result. Concerning the report of a confrontation\nwith the TSA screener at the security checkpoint, Applicant denied he had intimidated the screener\nor interrupted the screening process. Rather, uncertain of the location of his keys, he had lifted up\nthe raincoat submitted for screening to look under it. When the screener reached out to retrieve the\nitems from him, he attempted to stop the screener by holding his wrist.  Applicant was allowed to\n8\ndepart for Washington, D.C. at around 1000 hours.\nOn January 22, 2003, Applicant was charged in state district court with one count of\npossession of a hoax device or substance.  Applicant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. With the\n9\n\ncause a person reasonably to believe that such substance is a harmful chemical or biological agent, a\npoison, a harmful radioactive substance, or any other substance for causing serious bodily injury,\nendangering life or doing unusual damage to property, or both.\nThe assistant inspector who interviewed Applicant on January 16, 2003, did not follow up on Applicant\u2019s\n10\nreport that he was scheduled to meet with U.S. government protective services personnel. (Tr. 131)\n7\nagreement of the prosecution, on April 23, 2003, Applicant was placed on pretrial probation until\nApril 22, 2004, with special conditions: that he not transport any x-ray test suitcase or test materials\non any commercial carrier or other mode of transportation; that he ship any x-ray test suitcase or test\nmaterials separately in advance of his business travel; that he use only commercial mailing services\nthat allow the shipment of simulated test materials; that he check with the commercial mail service\nbefore shipping to ensure the carrier\u2019s willingness to ship the simulated test materials; that he declare\nthe items before shipping and the items must be clearly designated as test materials; and that he not\nviolate any federal transportation security regulations. Applicant was also required to pay a probation\nsupervision fee of $50 per month. The case was dismissed on April 22, 2004, on the\nrecommendation of the probation department.\nThe TSA pursued civil penalties against Applicant and his employer. On January 17, 2003,\na TSA security inspector, with the approval of the federal security director at the airport,\nrecommended that Applicant be required to pay a civil penalty of $5,500. By letter of January 18,\n2003, Applicant was notified by the TSA that it was investigating his failure to comply with Title\n49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 1540.105, which prohibits tampering or\ninterfering with aviation security systems, and Part 1540.109, which prohibits interfering with\nsecurity screening personnel in the performance of their duties. Company A was formally notified\nof the TSA investigation by letter of January 30, 2003.\nOn February 13, 2003, Applicant responded to the TSA. Citing his expertise and experience\nin x-ray detection security, Applicant indicated that the test suitcase he checked on January 16, 2003,\nwas clearly marked in large red letters with company A\u2019s name and as a \u201cX-ray Test Suitcase,\u201d that\nhe and other company A personnel had used this test suitcase for more than 15 years, and that he\nregularly traveled with it and a letter explaining its purpose. Applicant explained that at the security\ncheckpoint, he was surprised that he had been selected for secondary screening because he had\npassed through the metal detector without sounding the alarm. The items to be checked were on a\ntable in front of him when he looked into his trousers for his car keys \u201ccompletely forgetting that\nthey were most likely in the bin in front of [him].\u201d When he reached for the bin, the security screener\ngrabbed his arm, and \u201cas a reflex action,\u201d Applicant touched the screener\u2019s arm. Applicant went on\nthat the screener reported to his supervisor that Applicant had \u201ctouched\u201d him, whereupon Applicant\nresponded to the supervisor and screener that was \u201cridiculous.\u201d Applicant denied that he intended\nto intimidate or interfere with the screener, or that he intended to cause disruption or inconvenience\nwith respect to the test suitcase. He indicated that in the future all test bags would be shipped in\nadvance by overnight courier. (See Ex. 4)\nIn its response to TSA of February 25, 2003, company A forwarded documentation\nconfirming the purpose of Applicant\u2019s visit to Washington, D.C. on January 16, 2003, and the need\nfor the x-ray test bag on that occasion.  Company A informed TSA that Applicant routinely traveled\n10\nwith the test bag, which was clearly marked on the outside as a company x-ray test bag, and that\n\nIn setting forth her analysis, the lead TSA inspector indicated that Applicant deliberately conducted a test\n11\nwithin the operating airport environment (\u201cHis main focus was trying to get the test kit through the system without raising\nany flags.\u201d), which would prove that his company had a better x-ray system. (Ex. 27 p. 5) Yet in listing the factors and\nelements affecting Applicant\u2019s case, she indicated that by not presenting the letter from his company disclosing the\ncontents of his suitcase, Applicant \u201cdeliberately introduced items into a system that he know [sic] would activate alarms\u201d\n(Ex. 27, p. 2), contradicting herself on whether Applicant intended that the test bag be detected.\n8\nneither Applicant nor the company was attempting to tamper or interfere with aviation security\nsystems.\nFollowing TSA\u2019s investigation, the lead TSA inspector concluded on July 12, 2003, that\nApplicant deliberately violated federal regulations prohibiting the tampering, interfering, or\ncircumventing of any aviation security system (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.105(a)(1)), the transporting or\noffering to transport in checked baggage any unauthorized explosive or incendiary (49 C.F.R. \u00a7\n1540.111(c)(3)), and the interfering with screening personnel in the performance of their duties (49\nC.F.R. \u00a7 1540.109).   Given Applicant\u2019s expertise in x-ray screening technology, and his familiarity\n11\nwith airport screening procedures, the TSA inspectors found no mitigating conditions and\nrecommended Applicant be assessed a $5,500 civil penalty.\nOn August 27, 2003, TSA issued a notice of proposed civil penalty totaling $3,300 ($1,100\nfor each violation) to Applicant for attempting to circumvent, or tamper or interfere with a security\nsystem, for interfering with the airport screener, and for transporting or offering for transport in\nchecked baggage an unauthorized explosive or incendiary. On August 28, 2003, TSA issued a notice\nof proposed civil penalty totaling $2,200 to company A for Applicant\u2019s violation of the federal\nregulations prohibiting tampering or interfering with an airport security system and for transporting\nor offering for transport an unauthorized explosive or incendiary while he was traveling on behalf\nof the company. On November 28, 2003, TSA filed formal complaints asking an administrative law\njudge to enter orders assessing the respective civil penalties. On December 30, 2003, Applicant and\ncompany A filed their responses, denying that Applicant checked baggage containing what was\ndescribed in the complaints as a realistic replica of a firearm, a realistic simulated pipe bomb, and\na realistic replica of Semtex, utilized as testing devices, and that Applicant did not inform TSA or\nthe airline of the contents of the checked luggage. Applicant also denied that while undergoing the\nscreening process on January 16, 2003, he had \u201cobjected to his having to undergo security screening,\nmade loud demeaning remarks and grabbed the wrist of a TSA screener during the screening\nprocess.\u201d\nOn July 7, 2004, Applicant and company A entered into settlement agreements with the TSA.\nAs to Applicant, TSA agreed to issue a compromise order settling the alleged violations of 49 C.F.R.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1540.105(a)(1) and 1540.111(c)(3) on Applicant\u2019s payment of $2,200 within 30 days, and to issue\nan order assessing civil penalty of $1,100 against Applicant, with Applicant agreeing to pay it within\n30 days, for interfering with screening personnel in violation of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.109. Applicant\nagreed to abide by all TSA regulations relating to transport of firearms, explosives, and incendiary\ndevices, and to provide advance notice (at least 24 hours prior to scheduled departure) to TSA at the\nairport of departure and to the airline if he intended to travel with any or all of these items. Applicant\nentered into the settlement solely to avoid protracted litigation and did not admit the alleged\nviolations of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1540.105(a)(1) or 1540.111(c)(3). On July 15, 2004, TSA issued an order\n\n9\nassessing the $1,100 civil penalty for violating the regulation prohibiting interference with screening\npersonnel. Applicant paid the $3,300 under the terms of the settlement on July 15, 2004. \nOn July 15, 2004, TSA and company A entered into a settlement agreement under which\nTSA agreed to issue a compromise order dismissing the case on receipt of company A\u2019s payment\nof $2,200 to TSA within 30 days. Company A also agreed to abide by all TSA regulations relating\nto transport of firearms, explosives, and incendiary devices, and to provide advance notice (at least\n24 hours prior to scheduled departure) to TSA at the airport of departure and to the airline if an\nemployee intended to travel with any or all of these items. The settlement did not constitute an\nadmission by the company of the truth of any of the allegations set forth in the notice of proposed\ncivil penalty. The company paid the $2,200 on the date of settlement. On September 2, 2004, the\ncases against Applicant and company A were dismissed by TSA\u2019s administrative law judge as they\nhad been settled.\nOn May 12, 2003, company A notified the Defense Industrial Security Office (DISCO) that\nApplicant had checked a test bag clearly marked and containing simulated test items that was needed\non a visit to a government site on January 16, 2003, and that he had been stopped at an airport\nsecurity checkpoint after checking the bag, at which time he produced a letter explaining the contents\nof the bag. He was nonetheless placed on one year pretrial probation on a charge of\npossessing/transporting a hoax device or substance, and TSA was investigating.\nOn March 11, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) special\nagent about the incidents of January 16, 2003. He indicated he had no reason to believe that he was\nviolating any laws or policies as he had made the trip several times before and one occasion, had the\nbag inspected by airport screeners after he had gone through screening and been allowed to proceed\nwith the bag. He indicated the district attorney and his attorney had agreed to pretrial unsupervised\nprobation with conditions, and he expected the matter to be dismissed on April 22, 2004, as he had\nbeen in compliance. Applicant maintained he had no reason to believe that his handling of the\nmaterials was illegal or inappropriate. He denied that he had attempted to test any airport security\nequipment. He disclosed the pending civil action by TSA and expressed his willingness to pay any\ncivil fines leveled against him personally. Asked about any adverse contacts with police, Applicant\nrelated two occasions \u201caround 1995 and 1998\" where his former spouse complained to the police\nof domestic assault. He denied any physical assault on her with the intent of causing injury, but\nadmitted there was \u201cprobably pushing\u201d during the arguments.\nOn August 30, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by another DSS agent to update the status\nof the proposed civil penalties. Applicant indicated he and his employer had agreed to resolve the\nmatter with the TSA, despite his continued denial of any wrongdoing, in lieu of proceeding with the\nexpense and time consuming process of a formal administrative hearing.\nAs of early May 2007, Applicant\u2019s job title was vice president of government sales, although\nhis duties were expanding to include commercial chemical companies and nuclear facilities in the\nU.S. Applicant presented several character references from his government and business clients,\nincluding a branch chief in the TSA, who have security/protective service responsibilities within\n\nIn light of the obvious similarities in the recommendations, Applicant or his legal counsel is likely to have\n12\nproposed content language to his references. While this affects their weight, it is in Applicant\u2019s favor that so many\nreferences from throughout the government protective services sector elected to submit a reference for him. \nSee School District of Beverly v.

In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline J, a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.1 Applicant was twice charged with\ndomestic assault offenses, in October 1992 (\u00b6 1.a) and January 1994 (\u00b6 1.b), after his spouse called\nthe police during arguments. The charges were dismissed in each case, although Applicant admits\nthat there was some pushing involved (Tr. 260). In the jurisdiction where Applicant was charged,\na court has defined  assault and battery as \u201cthe intentional and unjustified use of force upon the\nperson of another, however slight.\u201d  DC  \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admission of criminal\n13\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged applies. Yet this criminal conduct\n\nSee Footnote 9, infra. While Applicant has in his possession a device that could be characterized as a hoax\n14\ndevice, items designed to simulate Semtex or other plastic explosives cannot ignite or explode. The state differentiates\nbetween a hoax device under \u00a7 102A1/2 and an infernal machine under \u00a7 102A that can endanger life or property.\n11\nis not likely to recur  in light of the passage of time without recurrence (\u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal\nbehavior was not recent), and his divorce (\u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.4. The person did not voluntarily commit\nthe act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur).\nThe government alleged a third, more recent domestic assault in 1998, apparently based on\nApplicant\u2019s disclosure to a DSS agent in March 2004 of \u201ctwo occasions around 1995 and 1998\nwhere the police contacted [him] after [his] former spouse made allegations of Domestic Assault.\u201d\n(Ex. 2) Available district court (Ex. 32, Ex. 33) and state criminal history records (Ex. H) do not\nsubstantiate that any charges were filed against Applicant in 1995 or 1998, or that there was a third\nincident of domestic assault.\nApplicant does not dispute, and the court records confirm, that he was charged in January\n2003 with possession of a hoax explosive device after he checked in as airline baggage simulated\nweapons and explosive devices, and that he was placed on one year of  pretrial probation.  Applicant\n14\nneed not be convicted for his conduct to raise criminal conduct concerns, as allegations of criminal\nconduct are enough to trigger DC \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.1. \nThere is conflicting evidence as to Applicant\u2019s motivations. Following her investigation, the\nTSA lead inspector concluded that Applicant acted deliberately in that he knew the airport screening\nsystems in place and conducted a test within an operating airport environment after he had been\ndenied the opportunity to do so. Applicant submits he was taking the case to Washington, D.C. at\nthe request of his government client to test equipment manufactured by his employer as he had done\nmany times before. Applicant knew TSA had new equipment in place because he had asked on\nJanuary 13, 2003,  if he could \u201cimage on one of [TSA\u2019s] new standard transmission X-ray systems,\na test object designed to assess the capabilities of X-ray system technology in general\u201d (Ex. 29), but\nhe also had a more immediate obligation to his employer to conduct his business in Washington in\na timely fashion (see Ex. D). However, the concerns in this case do not turn on whether Applicant\nhad taken advantage of a legitimate business trip to conduct an unauthorized test. A baggage screener\nlooking at an object designed to simulate pliable plastic explosives or a pipe bomb could reasonably\nbelieve that the device or substance was an infernal machine or a harmful chemical agent that could\ncause bodily injury, endanger life, or inflict unusual damage to property. As an expert in x-ray\ndetection systems, Applicant knew or should have known that detection could cause anxiety, unrest,\nfear, or personal discomfort. The passage of time (see \u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal behavior was\nnot recent) and his expressed regrets over his mistake (Tr. 217), are not persuasive of his reform\nwhere he persists in justifying his behavior by claiming he had done nothing other than what he had\nalways done.\nConsiderable Guideline E, Personal Conduct, concerns are raised as well by his failure to\ndisclose the contents of the test bag to airline or TSA personnel. See \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1, Conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information. Applicant carried a letter justifying his possession of the test bag, showing\nhe knew he might have to explain himself.  The fact that the bag was marked as a \u201cX-Ray Test Bag\u201d\ndoes not excuse his conduct since the markings provide little clue as to the bag\u2019s contents. It was\n\nSee 68 Fed. Reg. 7444 (Feb. 14, 2003).\n15\n12\narrogance, so clearly on display when he challenged the need for him to disclose the contents of his\nchecked baggage since other passengers did not need to do so, which led him also to interfere with\nthe airport screener at the checkpoint that morning. Upset with being selected for secondary\nscreening, Applicant made derogatory comments about the airport screening process and grabbed\na screener\u2019s wrist. Applicant claim of a reflexive action is not supported by the screener, who with\nno apparent motive to misrepresent, was sufficiently apprehensive to call for his supervisor.\nAs a member of the traveling public, Applicant has a responsibility to not tamper with or\ninterfere with an aviation security system (see 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.105), to not transport in checked\nbaggage an unauthorized explosive or incendiary (see 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.111(c)(3)), and to not\ninterfere with, assault, threaten, or intimidate screening personnel in the performance of their\nscreening duties (see 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.109). Under the terms of his settlement agreement with TSA,\nApplicant did not admit to any wrongdoing with respect to attempting to circumvent a security\nsystem or to transporting in checked baggage any unauthorized weapon, explosive or incendiary\nprohibited by 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.111(c)(3). Yet the evidence shows that by failing to present the letter\ndisclosing the contents of the test bag, he caused a disruption in the screening process for checked\nbaggage. Federal regulations, as interpreted by the Transportation Security Administration on\nFebruary 14, 2003, prohibit realistic replicas of explosive and incendiary devices in checked baggage\n\u201cbecause their detection would have the potential for causing delays and requiring the unwarranted\nexpenditure of time and resources on the part of law enforcement personnel.\u201d  He acknowledges\n15\nand regrets that he interfered with the TSA employee\u2019s performance of his duties at the security\ncheckpoint, and TSA assessed a $1,100 civil fine for the violation. Although the SOR allegations\nconcern a single business trip, he testified he traveled with the same suitcase without disclosing the\ncontents on several occasions. His violations of federal aviation transportation security regulations\nraise DC.\u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violations of any\nwritten or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency. There is no\ncorresponding mitigating condition.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nIn making the overall common sense decision required under \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, Applicant\u2019s\ncontributions to the defense effort weigh in his favor. Yet, his expertise and associations with high-\nranking government and business clients do not exempt him from complying with aviation security\nregulations. Applicant\u2019s failure to notify the airline that he was carrying simulated explosive and\nweapon devices is especially troubling (\u00b6 E2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct), in light of his knowledge of x-ray detection systems and experience as a frequent traveler\n(\u00b6 E2.2.1.4. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct). Even if his company did\nnot manufacture screening systems for checked luggage, Applicant, better than most, should have\nappreciated that the security of the U.S. depends on compliance without regard to personal position\nor convenience. It is simply not credible for him to claim that it never crossed his mind that he\nshouldn\u2019t check the bag (see Tr. 220), or that the letter he carried divulging the contents of the test\nbag had no value in his mind at the time (see Tr. 227).\n\n13\nIn evaluating the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (\u00b6 E2.2.1.9), Applicant and his\nemployer have complied with the terms of their settlement agreements with the TSA and sent the\ntest bag to client sites by commercial baggage service. However, a change in the way in which the\ntest bag is shipped does not remedy the judgment concerns caused by Applicant acting as if the rules\ndo not apply to him. He challenged why he should have presented the letter if other passengers did\nnot have to declare the contents of their checked baggage and questioned the security screener as to\nwhy he was selected for secondary screening (\u201cand I said what for, it didn\u2019t, the gate didn\u2019t alarm?\u201d).\nWhen asked on direct examination what impact that incident had on him, Applicant responded:\nIt\u2019s certainly shown me that there are things you should be aware of and take steps\nto avoid, and I learned a valuable lesson, you should not, even if you think you lost\nyour keys, try to get them before you are allowed to do that, and certainly the test\nsuitcase will never become a part of what I travel with unless it\u2019s shipped the proper\nway. (Tr. 245)\nAlthough Applicant regrets that he interfered with the security screener at the checkpoint (Tr. 233),\nhe continues to exhibit denial and/or minimization of his failure to comply with aviation\ntransportation security regulations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Her parents have held U.S. green cards for five years. They have\nlived in the U.S. half of the year in five of the past six years and all of the past year to prepare to\nbecome U.S. citizens which they expect to obtain in a few months. Her brother works in a low level\njob for a privatized telephone company. Her parents hope to sponsor her brother and his wife and\nchild to come to the U.S. as soon as the parents become citizens. Applicant is fully integrated into\nU.S. society and has little contact or interest in her country of birth. Applying the whole person\nanalysis I conclude in her favor. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2006, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received April 24, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations\nset forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2007.\nA Notice of Hearing was issued April 11, 2007 for a hearing held on April 25, 2007. Applicant\nwaived the 15 day notice requirement. The Government introduced two exhibits and Applicant\nintroduced nine exhibits at the hearing. All offered exhibits were accepted into evidence. The\ngovernment offered twelve official government documents for administrative notice. Three (Exhs.\nV, VI, and XII) were excluded from consideration and the rest were admitted. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf. The transcript was received on May 4, 2007. \nThe record was left open at the request of Applicant for 30 days for receipt of additional\nevidence. Applicant submitted additional evidence on in the form of four documents which were\nadmitted without objection into the record. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations relating to her family under Foreign Influence-Guideline\nB with explanatory information. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After\na complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the\nfollowing additional findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as an engineer\nsince 1993. She was born in Taiwan, came to the U.S. to attend high school, and lived with an uncle\nduring her high school years. She graduated with an engineering degree from a major U.S.\n\n3\nengineering school in 1992 when she also became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nApplicant was married in 1994 to another student she met at the university they attended. She\nhad been hired after her graduation by the same defense contractor where her husband where her\nhusband worked. Both of them work on the same program which involves one of many subsystems\nof a major weapons system of the Navy. Her annual salary is $80,000 and she and her husband have\na combined annual income of $190,000. Each has a 401(k) valued at over $100,000. They own their\nown home with no mortgage valued at approximately $350,000. All their assets are in the U.S. They\nhave little or no cultural interest in or contact with Taiwanese or Chinese culture or society.\nApplicant traveled to Taiwan with her fiance who became her husband on three occasions.\nThe first was in 1993 before she was employed and in 1997, and 2001 after her employment. The\ntrips were on family matters. The company was advised of the two trips taken during her\nemployment. She has held a security clearance since 1994 with no security violations. \nApplicant\u2019s parents and a brother are citizens of Taiwan. Her father retired from an electric\npower company where he worked as an accountant. He received a lump sum on retirement and gets\nnothing further from the company. Her mother has never worked except as a homemaker. Her\nparents visited in the U.S. with Applicant and her husband for several weeks each year during the\nfirst years of their marriage. Since 2002 they have spent half of each year in the U.S. as they were\napplying for citizenship. Each has had a green card for the past five years. They have lived with\nApplicant and her husband in the U.S. permanently for the past year as they prepare to take the\nexamination for citizenship (Exhs. I and J). Her parents own a condo in Taiwan where they lived and\nalso own a house in the U.S. which they purchased to provide rental income for Applicant while she\nwas in school. The property is still rented.\nApplicant\u2019s brother lives in Taiwan and works as a lineman for a telephone company which\nhas been privatized. The government still holds a minority interest in the company with most of the\nstock held by commercial financial entities (Exh. J 1-3). He served a mandatory two year military\nduty as required by the Taiwan government. He visited Applicant and her husband in the U.S. once\nin 2006 for a sight-seeing trip. She talks to him only once a year and exchanges cards on significant\ndays. He is married with a young son. As soon as Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law become citizens they\nintend to sponsor the family to come to the U.S. (Tr. 167). \nApplicant is highly regarded for her work in her job by her supervisors and colleagues who\nsubmitted statements on her behalf. She has an excellent reputation for honesty, work ethic and her\ntechnical engineering skills are superb. She carefully adheres to the rules of the company for all\nmatters and knows the security rules and requirements. She receives annual security briefings and\nknows that any possible breach would require immediate reporting to security officers (Exhs. A-G).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527\n\n4\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\n\u201cA security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family and other persons to whom\nhe or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States\nor may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that\ncould result in the compromise of classified information.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1. Having\nimmediate family members who are citizens of, and residing in a foreign country, may raise a\ndisqualifying security concern. Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1.\nCONCLUSION\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR: \nConditions under Foreign Influence Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close\nties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country. (E2.A2.1.2.1.) Based\non the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government established reasons\nto raise security concerns because of foreign influence. Having established such reasons, the\nApplicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates,\nor extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nPossible mitigating conditions that might be applicable to allegations relating to her family\nare a determination that the individuals in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position\nto be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty\nto the persons involved and the U.S.(E2.A2.1.3.1.), and contacts and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent. (E2.A2.1.3.3.) By definition parents and siblings are persons with\n\n5\nclose ties of affection. Thus, the specific mitigating conditions are not applicable.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security of the\nnation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant is a person of substance and veracity who has a responsible position of trust and\nis doing and has done a good job for her company for 13 years. She provided sincere and credible\ntestimony as to her family, motivations, and loyalty to the U.S. She is totally integrated into U.S.\nculture, and divorced from any cultural contact with her country of origin. The status of her parents\nin becoming U.S. citizens certainly lessens any likelihood of coercion or pressure from them\nadversely affecting security interests. Her brother has a low level job with a privatized company in\nTaiwan. She communicates with him infrequently and he may become a U.S. citizen if sponsorship\nby their parents becomes possible. \nWhile there is evidence that Taiwan has engaged in economic and military espionage, and\nthat the PRC may use it as a source of information as stated in official documents (Exhs. IV, and XI),\nthe U.S. consistently has supported Taiwan for its democratically elected government (Exh. II).\nApplicant shows no loyalty to Taiwan or the PRC and is a competent professional who has\ndemonstrated that she knows how to deal with any pressures that might be brought against her by\nan agent of a foreign government.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nclearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph l Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nAfter full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case,\n\n6\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Clearance is granted. \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July 29, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Conduct), Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n\nThe forensic psychiatrist concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201ccondition is no longer active.\u201d AE A at 4.\n1\nDecision at 2, n. 2.\n2\n2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 26, 2007, after\nthe hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge demonstrated bias against\nApplicant; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Between 1993 and 2002, Applicant\ndownloaded pornographic images onto his computer from the internet, amassing a collection of\naround 63,000.  A small number of these images, perhaps a hundred or less, depicted nude images\nunder the age of 18 and included \u201cvideo clips of adults engaging in sexual acts with minors.\u201d  On\nother occasions, Applicant used a radio scanner to listen to other persons\u2019 cordless telephone\nconversations, sometimes taping them for future listening.  He also took photographs of female\nrevelers baring their upper bodies during Mardi Gras in New Orleans, posting them on his website\nand offering them for sale.  These activities were discovered when Applicant underwent a \u201clifestyle\npolygraph\u201d pursuant to his employment with a government agency.  Applicant consulted a\npsychologist and, in preparation for the hearing, a forensic psychiatrist as well.  These persons\nconcluded that Applicant suffered from \u201ca sexual disorder not otherwise specified\u201d and that he was\nnot a security risk.   Applicant continues to view pornography on line about 1-2 hours a week.  The\n1\nJudge\u2019s findings include the following in a footnote: \u201cAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted to \u201cpeeping tom\u201d activity with binoculars, both in his neighborhood and while traveling on\nbusiness.\u201d    \n2\nApplicant\u2019s first assignment of error refers to a remark the Judge made during Applicant\u2019s\nclosing argument.  Applicant argues that comment indicates that the Judge did not believe the\nargument Applicant was making and that therefore the Judge\u2019s decision was not fair or impartial.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to rebut\nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App.\nBd. May 14, 2004).  The Board has noted that the issue is not whether Applicant believes the Judge\nwas biased or prejudiced against Applicant.  Rather, the issue is whether the record contains any\nindication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the\nfairness or impartiality of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 19,\n2001).  Assessing credibility is within the authority of a Judge, and adverse findings by a Judge do\nnot, by themselves, indicate bias.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09401 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).\nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the cited comment constitutes bias on the\npart of the Judge.  \nIn contending that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, Applicant\nraises two arguments.  The first is that the Judge committed error by failing to find that Applicant\u2019s\nbehavior was mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard lacks merit.  In his conclusions, the\nJudge discussed the record evidence and explained why Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  Moreover, the application of disqualifying and mitigating\n\nSee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A; Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002).\n3\n\u201cMy most serious crime is possession of child pornography.  I began collecting images from the internet in\n4\n1993 . . . In early April 2002 my digital image and video collection consisted of over 63,000 files, of which about 100\nwere nude photos of minors, mostly by famous photographers . . . and in my estimation, less than a dozen that would have\nmet the legal definition of child pornography.\u201d  GE 2 (Applicant statement to Defense Security Service) at 2.\n\u201c[Applicant] stated that he frequents various Internet newsgroups and automatically downloads a significant number of\npornographic pictures . . .although he did not originally intend to download child pornography . . .[o]n occasion he has\nput those files into a folder on his hard drive and saved them . . . [He] has viewed Internet pictures of naked children\nranging in age from 5 to 18.\u201d  GE 4 (Memo by Government Agency) at 1. \n3\nconditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts\nof a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of\nsome mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the facts, or an ability to argue for a difrerent interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-05439 at 2 (App. Bd. May 29,\n2007).\nApplicant also argues that the government failed to produce evidence that his use of the\nscanner and possession of photographs of minors was illegal.  On this latter point, he contends that\nthe government presented no evidence that these images were those of actual minors.   Therefore,\n3\nApplicant contends that the Judge should not have found against him on these matters insofar as they\nwere alleged under Guideline J.  The Board finds that the Judge\u2019s finding concerning child\npornography is based upon substantial evidence, sufficient to shift the burden of persuasion to\nApplicant.   Any error as to the legality of the scanner is harmless.  Furthermore, the Judge\u2019s\n4\ndecision, read in light of the record as a whole, articulates a rational connection between his findings\nand his adverse security clearance decision.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v.\nState Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  The record supports the conclusion that\nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly in the interests of national\nsecurity\u201d for him to have a clearance.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at\n2 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\n2\nMetz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\nApplicant contends essentially that the Judge erred in weighing the evidence in this case and\nthat his overall unfavorable decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.\nIn support of that contention, Applicant argues that he does not discuss his work with his father in\nIndia; his father is now retired; he is financially independent; he is not in a position to be exploited;\nand he has never been involved in activities against the United States. Applicant also emphasizes his\ncontacts with the United States including the fact that he has voted in U.S. elections, has served on\na jury, and pays taxes.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by his foreign ties and connections had not been mitigated.\nAlthough Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nnature and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant with respect to all but\none of the factual allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which\nthe Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited\nby Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\n\n3\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).

Mendez, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 2, 2005 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nApplicant chose to have his case resolved on the written record.  On October 31, 2006\nAdministrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr. granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s denial of his motion to amend the SOR by adding to allegations under Guideline E was error\nand whether such error warrants reversal of the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision.  We\nremand the Judge\u2019s decision with instructions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings and Ultimate Conclusions\nThis is an appeal that raises procedural, rather than substantive, issues.  A detailed review,\ndiscussion and analysis of the Judge\u2019s substantive findings and conclusions is therefore not\nnecessary.  Moreover, Department Counsel\u2019s brief concerns itself only with the issue of the Judge\u2019s\ndenial of his motion to expand the SOR by adding new allegations under a new Guideline.  The\nJudge\u2019s favorable findings and conclusions under Guideline F remain wholly unchallenged and, thus,\nstand.     \nThe June 2, 2005 SOR contained nine allegations under Guideline F.  Applicant submitted\nan answer to the SOR on June 24, 2005.  Allegation 1.c. of the SOR maintained that Applicant was\nindebted to a credit organization in the approximate amount of $23,000.00 after resale of an\nautomobile that had been repossessed.  The allegation stated that as of November 21, 2003, the debt\nhad not been satisfied.  Applicant denied allegation 1.c., stating that the account had been filed with\nthe bankruptcy courts (Applicant had filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in May 2001 that was quickly\nconverted to a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy), and that according to a more recent credit report, the account\nhad been closed.\nIn his June 24, 2005 answer, Applicant indicated that he wanted a hearing.  In anticipation\nof the hearing, on May 5, 2006, and May 11, 2006,  Department Counsel mailed documents he\nwould be offering at the hearing to Applicant (FORM Item 15).  These documents included an\nofficial memorandum from the Army and Applicant\u2019s Certificate of Release or Discharge from the\nArmy.  Together, these documents indicated  that Applicant was discharged from the Army due to\na personality disorder, and that the Army had raised the issue of Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability\nin the context of his ability to safeguard the national security.  On May 15, 2006, Applicant retracted\nhis request for a hearing and expressed his preference for the Judge to decide the case on the record.\nThis was due to the fact that Applicant was working overseas and he did not expect to return for a\nconsiderable length of time (FORM Item 4).  \nIn response to Applicant\u2019s retraction of his request for a hearing, Department Counsel\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) to Applicant on August 8, 2006.  The FORM\ncontained the official memorandum from the Army and Applicant\u2019s DD Form 214.  The FORM also\nincluded, as a preliminary matter, Department Counsel\u2019s Motion to Amend SOR.  Specifically,\nDepartment Counsel moved to add two allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The first\nproposed allegation asserted that Applicant falsified his answer to the original SOR (allegation 1.c.\n\n3\nas described in a previous paragraph) by indicating that he had included the $23,000.00 automobile\ndebt in his bankruptcy petition, when, in fact, he had not.  The second proposed allegation asserted\nthat Applicant had been discharged from the United States military in 2000 because of concerns\nregarding his judgment or reliability with regard to safeguarding classified national security\ninformation or special nuclear information or material.  \nApplicant responded to the FORM on September 18, 2006.  Regarding Department Counsel\u2019s\nMotion to Amend the SOR, Applicant responded in a portion of his submission entitled \u201cObjection\nto Amend Statement of Reasons.\u201d  His detailed responses were essentially denials of what was\nalleged in the proposed amendments.  Applicant then countered with his own motion to keep the\nSOR in its original configuration and for the Judge to enter findings based upon the non-amended\nallegation[s].     \nIn his decision, the Judge denied Department Counsel\u2019s Motion to Amend prior to his\nresolution of the case under Guideline F.  The Judge stated the following as his reasons for the\ndenial: (a) Applicant was not previously provided any notice that his personal conduct or the security\nconcerns posed under Guideline E were at issue; (b) the Guideline E concerns were raised for the\nfirst time after he chose to pursue a determination based solely on the written submissions, rather\nthan personally appear before the Department; (c) by now attempting to introduce an entirely\ndifferent litany of security concerns of which Applicant had no prior notice, Department Counsel has\npotentially abrogated Applicant\u2019s right to personally appear before the Department, as provided\nunder the Directive; (d) to have afforded the Applicant the opportunity to request a personal\nappearance would have posed little more administrative burden than did Department Counsel\u2019s\ninvitation to him to object to the motion at issue, and would have been in better keeping with both\nthe spirit of the Directive and the basic tenets of administrative justice; (e) of more practical concern,\nDepartment Counsel has not presented evidence making a prima facie case of falsification (under\nproposed additional allegation 2.a.).  \nRegarding the Judge\u2019s ruling on the motion, Department Counsel asserts the following on\nappeal: (i) the Judge denied Department Counsel\u2019s motion as to proposed additional allegation 2.a.\nbut did not consider and did not rule upon Department Counsel\u2019s motion as to proposed additional\nallegation 2.b.; (ii) the Directive and Appeal Board precedent envision broad latitude in granting\namendments to SORs and, in this case, the Judge erroneously failed to follow the Board\u2019s liberal\nmandate with regard to granting motions to amend; (iii) the Judge erroneously injected a requirement\nthat any amendment to the SOR have a nexus and relationship to the existing allegations; (iv) the\nJudge could have easily remedied his concerns about Applicant\u2019s due process rights by offering him\na further opportunity to request a hearing; (v) the Judge\u2019s denial of Department Counsel\u2019s Motion\nto Amend constituted reversible error.\nAdministrative Judges\u2019 rulings on motions, such as a motion to amend an SOR, are reviewed\nfor an abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-26115 at 2   (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 02-12199 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2007).  Department Counsel points out in his initial\nargument that the Judge fails to mention or discuss the merits of the Motion to Amend with regard\nto proposed allegations 2.b.  When dealing with a procedural motion such as the one before us, the\nBoard will not presume that the Judge considered an important component of that motion where the\nJudge\u2019s decision is silent as to it.  Clearly, a failure of the Judge to rule at all on specific matter that\n\nThe Judge\u2019s language in this part of his decision seems to indicate his belief that the offering of a choice of a\n1\nhearing to Applicant in the face of a Motion to Amend the SOR was the sole prerogative of Department Counsel. \n4\nhas been brought before him is an abuse of discretion.  For this reason alone, the Judge\u2019s ruling on\nthe motion cannot be sustained.\nDepartment Counsel correctly points out that a liberal mandate exists with regard to granting\nmotions to amend SORs.  The Board has recognized the proposition that administrative pleadings\nshould be liberally construed and easily amended.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0447 at 4 (App. Bd.\nJul. 25, 2000).  As long as there is fair notice to the affected party and the affected party has a\nreasonable opportunity to respond, a case should be adjudicated on the merits of relevant issues and\nnot concerned with pleading niceties.  See, e.g., Yellow Freight System Inc. v. Martin, 954 F.2d 353,\n358 (6  Cir. 1992).  The overall purposes of the industrial security program are not well-served by\nth\ninterpreting the Directive in a manner that emphasizes pleading formalities over a full and fair\nadjudication of cases on the merits. Cf. ISCR Case No. 98-0395 at 4 n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 1999)\n(Directive should be construed broadly in order to effectuate the purposes of the industrial security\nprogram).  The restrictive approach toward SOR amendments taken by the Judge in this case is an\nabuse of discretion and is not necessary to ensure that Applicant\u2019s rights under the Directive are\nrespected.\nIndeed, the Judge\u2019s overall rationale for denying the motion is flawed in that it presupposes\nthat Applicant\u2019s decision to forgo a hearing and proceed on a written record is a choice that cannot\nbe undone, even in the face of changed circumstances such as Department Counsel\u2019s request for an\namended SOR that involved the introduction of new security concerns under a different Guideline.\nThe Judge was rightly concerned about the potential denial of due process that would result from a\ngranting of Department Counsel\u2019s motion followed by the Judge\u2019s final adjudication of the case\nbased solely on the written record.  The fundamental shortcoming in his ruling on the motion was\nhis failure to affirmatively act upon that concern.  An administrative judge has the authority, under\nItems 10 and 17 of the Additional Procedural Guidance, to deal with a motion to amend the SOR in\na manner that reasonably balances the right of the government to have relevant and material\ninformation considered and the right of an applicant to receive fair notice and a reasonable\nopportunity to respond.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0447 at 6 (July 25, 2000).  In the instant case,\nthe Judge mentioned the appropriateness of affording Applicant the opportunity to request a hearing\non the additional and distinct allegations proffered by Department Counsel in his motion, but then\nfailed to recognize that it was within his authority to rule that Applicant be given the opportunity to\nrequest a hearing to respond to the new Guideline E allegations.   To restrict unduly a party\u2019s ability\n1\nto amend the SOR, through a failure to recognize or employ an ancillary remedy that would facilitate\namending the SOR while protecting the rights of the parties, was an abuse of discretion on the part\nof the Judge.\nIt should be noted that Department Counsel concedes in his brief that the Judge had the\npower to allay his own concerns about the motion by offering Applicant a further opportunity to\nrequest a hearing.  Department Counsel made this concession after arguing that it was not necessary\nto allow Applicant a further opportunity to request a hearing in this case.  On this latter point the\nBoard disagrees.  As pointed out by the Judge, the proposed amendments were not minor alterations\nto existing SOR allegations.  Rather, they were entirely new allegations brought under a Guideline\nnot previously alleged.  Proof of these allegations would require presentation of evidence wholly\n\nIn his appeal brief, Department Counsel asserts the Judge erred by creating an applicant\u2019s right to be given\n2\nanother opportunity to request a hearing whenever an SOR is amended.  Department Counsel reads the Judge\u2019s decision\ntoo broadly.  When commenting on Applicant\u2019s right to a hearing, the Judge repeatedly notes Department Counsel\u2019s\nattempt to expand the SOR with the addition of a \u201cnew and distinct guideline.\u201d  Thus, the Judge\u2019s remarks are confined\nto the facts of this case.  Similarly, Department Counsel argues that the Judge erroneously injected a requirement that\nany amendment to the SOR have a nexus and relationship to the existing allegations.  A fair reading of the Judge\u2019s\ndecision reveals that the statement was made strictly in the context of whether or not Applicant would be entitled to\nanother opportunity to elect a hearing, and was not intended to be a comment on a party\u2019s ability, generally, to amend\nthe SOR.     \n5\nseparate and apart from the evidence used to establish Department Counsel\u2019s case under the original\nSOR.  Under such circumstances, Applicant is entitled to an opportunity to request a hearing on the\nnew Guideline and the specific allegations brought thereunder.            \n2\nThe Judge concludes his remarks on the motion by indicating that as a matter of practical\nconcern, Department Counsel had not presented evidence establishing a prima facie case of\nfalsification (proposed additional allegation 2.a.).  The Judge went on to discuss and analyze the\nevidence relating to the falsification, indicated his conclusion that Department Counsel\u2019s view of the\nevidence was incorrect, and included his analysis of the falsification evidence as a reason for denying\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s Motion to Amend the SOR.  To do so was an abuse of discretion.  The Judge\nwas entitled to consider a number of factors when making a decision about a purely procedural\nrequest such as this one.  These might include (but are not limited to) the timing of the request, the\nnature of the request and the extent to which the moving party had an earlier opportunity to proffer\nthe proposed amendments.  However, an evaluation of the strength of the moving party\u2019s case under\nthe proposed additional allegation is not a proper matter for consideration when resolving a purely\nprocedural matter.  The substantive merits of Department Counsel\u2019s falsification case are irrelevant\nto consideration of whether his Motion to Amend should be granted.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-\n0018 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2000)(commenting upon the impropriety of considering substantive\naspects of a case to resolve a purely procedural issue).\nDepartment Counsel asks the Board to reverse the Judge\u2019s favorable decision in this case,\narguing that the unfavorable evidence under Guideline E that the Judge erroneously refused to\nconsider precludes granting Applicant a security clearance.  The Board cannot grant Department\nCounsel the relief he seeks.  By requesting reversal, Department Counsel is asking the Board to make\nfindings and conclusions unfavorable to Applicant on the yet unadjudicated Guideline E allegations.\nThe Board has no authority to step into the shoes of a Hearing Office Administrative Judge and make\nsuch findings and conclusions and then use them to determine the final outcome of a case on appeal.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2004).  Given the errors discussed earlier\nin this decision, remand is the proper remedy. \n Order\nThe Judge\u2019s formal findings under Guideline F are AFFIRMED inasmuch as they have not\nbeen challenged on appeal.  Regarding the Judge\u2019s ruling denying Department Counsel\u2019s Motion to\nAmend the SOR, the case is REMANDED with instructions to allow Department Counsel to submit\nthe SOR under Guideline E.  Applicant should then be afforded an opportunity to (a) formally\nanswer the new allegations, and (b) choose whether he desires a hearing on the new allegations.\nWhen providing these specific instructions on remand, the Board must take into account the fact that\n\n6\nthe Judge below has, in essence, already made findings and conclusions on one of Department\nCounsel\u2019s proposed additional allegations in the context of ruling on the Motion to Amend.  The\nevidence that the Judge reviewed was never formally incorporated into the record, and, when\ndiscussing and analyzing that evidence, the Judge resolved a matter that was not properly before him.\nThus, the Judge appears to have prejudged a portion of Department Counsel\u2019s case.  To preclude the\npossibility that this irregularity will prejudice the rights of one of the parties, the Board recommends\nthat the case be remanded to a new Judge who has no prior involvement in the case.  \nSigned: Michael Y.
