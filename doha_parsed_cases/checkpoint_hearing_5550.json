Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 1, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline J for criminal conduct.  \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nMarch 24, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 17, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on December 20, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled\non February 7, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was received on February 19, 2008.\nThe record was left open until February 21, 2008, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional documentary exhibits. Those matters were timely\nsubmitted and forwarded by department counsel who had no objections. The post-\nhearing matters are admitted as follows: (1) Exhibit B\u2013three character references; (2)\nExhibit C\u2013employee performance review; (3) Exhibit D\u2013court record; and (4) Exhibit\nE\u2013DD Form 214 (three pages). For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges Applicant was involved in three incidents of\ncriminal conduct in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and the first two incidents resulted in the\nArmy imposing nonjudicial punishment. In his Answer, Applicant admits the factual\nallegations in the SOR. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts\nare established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He works as a\nsupply technician. He has worked for his current employer since retiring from the Army\nin October 2005. \nApplicant has been married since 1985, although he and his spouse have lived\nseparately since about February 2006. He has not sought to divorce her as of yet so\nthat she has health insurance for medical problems.  \nApplicant served on active duty in the Army from 1985 to 2005 (Exhibit E). He\nserved as a unit supply specialist, retiring as a sergeant (pay grade E5). His discharge\npaperwork indicates extensive military education as well as numerous decorations,\nmedals, and badges, to include the following: (1) Army Achievement Medal (6  award),\nth\nArmy Commendation Medal (7  award), and Army Good Conduct Medal (6  award). He\nth\nth\nreceived an honorable discharge upon his retirement. \nIn 1998, Applicant was serving as a staff sergeant working in supply for a military\npolice unit. He underwent a random urinalysis, which tested positive for the presence of\ncocaine. As a result, Applicant\u2019s command initiated nonjudicial punishment under Article\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n3\n15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Applicant was found guilty of the offense\nof wrongful use of cocaine and the punishment included reduction from pay grade E6 to\nE5. Applicant maintains he did not use cocaine in the traditional way (snorting or\nsmoking), but admits that he was involved in a sexual encounter with his wife that\ninvolved cocaine (salacious details omitted here). \nIn 2003, Applicant was serving in Iraq when, as a married man, he engaged in a\nsexual relationship with a female soldier. As a result, Applicant\u2019s command initiated\nnonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ. Applicant was found guilty of adultery,\nwhich is an offense under military law. The punishment included reduction from pay\ngrade E5 to E4. Applicant was able to earn his sergeant\u2019s stripes back before his\nretirement in 2005, when he retired at the pay grade of E5. Applicant does not dispute\nthis misconduct. \nIn 2005, state law enforcement officials arrested Applicant for money laundering\n(Exhibits A, D, 2, 3, and 5). He was accused of laundering $1,200 of drug money for\nanother individual. In February 2005, a state grand jury indicted Applicant and the other\nindividual for one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering for conduct that took\nplace in April 2004 (Exhibit 2). The case moved slowly and was finally disposed of in\nAugust 2007, when the court granted the district attorney\u2019s motion to retire the case\nfrom the court\u2019s docket (Exhibit D). The court record indicates the retirement was with\nApplicant\u2019s consent and it was conditioned on his good behavior for one year (August\n2008). Retirement of a case is akin to a nolle prosequi or other termination of a\nprosecutorial action. Applicant maintains he was innocent of any wrongdoing and he\nsimply got mixed up with the wrong individual. \nConcerning his job performance, Applicant is a knowledgeable and solid\nperformer (Exhibits B and C). Two Army noncommissioned officers and a warrant officer\nvouched for Applicant\u2019s character, good duty performance, and trustworthiness. He\nreceived a very high rating on a recent employee performance review, which described\nhis performance as outstanding. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions for Guideline J). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n16\n DC 3 is \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\n17\nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n5\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the security concern is that \u201ccriminal\n14\nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\u201d  \n15\nTurning to the criminal conduct disqualifying conditions, both DC 1  and DC 3\n16\n17\napply based on the two Article 15 proceedings in 1998 and 2003 as well as Applicant\u2019s\narrest and indictment for a state felony offense in 2005. The totality of the disqualifying\ninformation calls into question Applicant\u2019s judgment as well as his ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions could mitigate the security\nconcern. The potentially relevant MC are:\n\u2022\n[S]o much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u2022\n[T]he person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n\u2022\n[E]vidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n\u2022\n[T]here is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nThe first MC applies, in part, to the two Article 15 proceedings. Applicant is no\nlonger on active military duty, both offenses involved his wife, and they are now living\nseparately with little chance of reconciliation. These circumstances suggest that similar\nincidents are unlikely to recur.  \nThe second MC does not apply. There is no evidence of pressure or coercion in\nany of the three incidents. \n\n6\nThe third MC applies, in part, because there is some evidence that Applicant is\ninnocent of the money laundering charge. He maintained his innocence in the state\ncourt proceedings and here as well. Moreover, the fact that the district attorney was\nwilling to retire the case, instead of prosecuting it, is some evidence that Applicant did\nnot commit the crime. \nThe fourth MC applies, in part, because there is some evidence of successful\nrehabilitation. Applicant was able to recover from the Article 15 proceedings and retire\nfrom the Army with an honorable discharge. In addition, he has a good employment\nrecord with his current employer. And there have been no further incidents of criminal\nconduct since his arrest in 2005. Undercutting the credit in mitigation, however, is that\nthe retirement of the state criminal case was conditioned on Applicant\u2019s good behavior\nuntil August 2008. Although this status is not the same as parole or probation, it\nindicates that the court kept open the possibility of restoring the case to the active\ndocket for trial or further proceedings (Exhibit D).   \nI have considered the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and\nunfavorable, and conclude that Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct raises doubt\nabout his  suitability for a security clearance. In particular, the conditional retirement of\nthe state criminal case militates against a favorable decision at this time. What\u2019s missing\nhere is a long-term track record of Applicant as a law-abiding person. Once he\ncompletes the period of good behavior in August 2008, time will tell if he will be able to\nestablish such a track record. \nDuring the proceeding, Applicant relied on his 20 years of honorable military\nservice as evidence of his suitability for a security clearance. I have given that\ncircumstance due consideration and weight, but also note that good soldiers do not get\ninvolved with cocaine and good soldiers do not commit adultery. In other words,\nApplicant\u2019s military service is insufficient by itself to overcome the case against him. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.c:\n \nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

In April 1998, Applicant married his current spouse (W2), and has two stepdaughters (ages 19 and 22) from this marriage. Applicant provides financial support for W2 and their children. While separated but still married to W1, Applicant encountered difficulties in meeting his marital debts without help from his estranged spouse and filed for Chapter 13 relief during the 1997 period (R.T., at 35, 61-62).

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn September 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 4, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 3, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nJanuary 30, 2008.  A hearing was held on January 30, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one\nMarch 31, 2008\n\n2\nexhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on February 7, 2008.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access classified\ninformation is denied.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\n         At the outset of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s request to convert his FORM into a\nhearing was approved.  Hearing was permitted to proceed. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of any information pertaining to the sale of his home\n(including the sale price of his foreclosed home) and an updated income and expense\nstatement.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement\nthe record.  In turn, the Government was granted three days to respond.  Within the\ntime permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with an updated earnings and\nexpense statement, but nothing pertaining to his home foreclosure.  His post-hearing\nexhibit was admitted as exhibit G and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 30 delinquent  debts\nexceeding $120,000.00.  Under Guideline E, he allegedly falsified his security clearance\napplication of August 8, 2005, by omitting his debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent,\nrespectively. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the alleged debts, without\nexplanation.  Responding to the falsification allegations covered by Guideline E,\nApplicant denied any intentional omission of the information called for in his security\nclearance application.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old warehouseman for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married his first wife (W1) in June 1987 and has one adopted son (age\n20) from this marriage (ex. 1).  Applicant divorced W1 in February 1998.  In April 1998,\nApplicant married his current spouse (W2), and has two stepdaughters (ages 19 and\n22) from this marriage.  Applicant provides financial support for W2 and their children. \nWhile separated but still married to W1, Applicant encountered difficulties in\nmeeting his marital debts without help from his estranged spouse and filed for Chapter\n13 relief during the 1997 period (R.T., at 35, 61-62).  Most of the covered debts were\ncredit cards, which Applicant acknowledges to be indicative of living beyond his means\n\n3\n(R.T., at 61-62). Applicant satisfactorily completed the Chapter 13 plan approved by the\nbankruptcy court and paid off all of his scheduled creditors. (R.T., at 61). \nSince his marriage to W2, Applicant and his spouse have accumulated numerous\nadditional debts (30 in all).  Most of these delinquent debts were accumulated between\n2002 and 2006, and primarily reflect medical co-pay debts associated with medical\nservices provided his wife and youngest daughter that were not picked up by their\nmedical insurance (R.T., at 43-44, 70-71).  Some, though, are consumer debts.  In the\naggregate they total about $6,000.00.  \nBy far, Applicant\u2019s largest listed debt is a mortgage debt of $114,000.00 on a\nhome purchased in January 2005 for $120,000.00 (R.T., at 51)  Applicant and W2\nfinanced his purchase of the home with a fixed rate mortgage and no down payment\n(R.T., at 51).  Whether Applicant and W2 obligated themselves on a purchase money\nmortgage to meet the down payment requirements of secondary lenders is not clear. \nFaced with mounting medical expenses associated with his daughter, he put the\nhome up for sale in May 2006 (R.T., at 45).  While the home was being marketed,\nApplicant and W2 stopped making mortgage payments (R.T., at 46).  Six months later\n(in December 2006), the lender foreclosed on the property (R.T.,at 47).  While Applicant\nbelieves the lender utilized non-judicial procedures to complete its foreclosure of the\nproperty, Applicant never opened the envelopes, and, accordingly, cannot be\ncompletely certain what kind of foreclosure procedures the lender utilized to schedule\nand complete the sale of the property (R.T., at 48-49).  Applicant has not received any\npost-sale bills or notices from the seller that he is aware of, and does not know whether\nor not the sale proceeds covered the mortgage obligation.\nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant and his wife have not been able to pay any of\ntheir admitted listed debts (R.T., at 64).  So far, they have confined their payment efforts\nto downsizing in their living arrangements, paying off Applicant\u2019s car loan, and several\nother debts (R.T., at 35, 69).  Currently, Applicant brings home $2,229.14 in net monthly\nincome (see ex. G).  Additionally, he receives child support from W1 for their son in the\namount of $300.00 a month and Social Security benefits for their youngest daughter in\nthe amount of $700.00 a month (R.T., at 66-67).   Together, Applicant and W2 currently\nreceive about $4,000.00 a month in income and benefits (R.T., at 68).  Applicant\u2019s net\nmonthly income promises to increase some when W2 returns to work in February 2008,\nas expected (see ex. G). \nSet off against Applicant\u2019s income are his current monthly expenses and debts:\nthey total approximately $2,050.00 in expenses and $85.00 in debts, based on his most\nrecent personal financial statement (see ex. G). This represents a considerable\ndeduction from the monthly expenses and debts he reported at hearing (R.T., at 68-69).\nJust on the basis of his last reported net monthly income and expenses/debts\n(excluding child support, Social Security benefits for Applicant\u2019s youngest daughter, and\nW2's anticipated income supplement), Applicant is left with a net positive remainder of\njust $94.00.a month in which to address his debts.\n\n4\nApplicant has sought no formal counseling regarding his finances. He assures he\nis not behind with any of his current bills, but could identify no source of emergency\nrelief to help him with his listed debts. \nAsked to complete a security clearance application (SF-86) in August 2005,\nApplicant omitted his debts over 80 and 90 days delinquent, respectively, when\nresponding to questions 38 and 39.  With his working two jobs, he consistently relied on\nW2 to pay their bills and did not realize he had debts over 180 or 90 days past due\nwhen he completed the security questionnaire (R.T., at 41-43, 73-74).  He attributed his\nomissions to his haste in completing the application without first checking his credit\nreport  for listed debts that had not been paid.  He assures he did not purposely omit his\ndelinquent debts (R.T., at 43, 74-75). \nSeveral months after completing his SF-86, Applicant was interviewed by an\nagent from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (R.T., at 38).  Applicant recalls\nreviewing his credit report with the agent and answering questions about certain debts\nlisted in the credit report (R.T., at 38-40). \nTo be sure, most of Applicant\u2019s omitted debts are medically-related and relatively\nsmall in amount.  Without a credit report or spouse to double-check the reported status\nof his debts, it is conceivable that he might not have known he had debts at the time\nthat had been or were 180 days delinquent, or were then over 90 days delinquent.  By\nthe accounts of his performance evaluations, Applicant has consistently been\ncharacterized as an industrious, reliable performer (see exs. B and C).  Friends who\nknow him, attest to his honesty and trustworthiness (see ex. A).  These are important\ncharacter gauges when assessing his overall disposition for honesty and integrity.\nConsidering all of the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s omissions, his claims of inadvertent\nomission are accepted as both plausible and credible.  Inferences warrant that\nApplicant\u2019s initial omissions were not deliberate, and not made with any intent to\nintentionally mislead the Government.  \nPolicies\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\n\n5\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure\nto cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversarial proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take into account cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a warehouseman for a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts (medical, consumer-related, and home-related) over a five-\nyear period spanning 2002 and 2006.  Considered together, and without resolution,\nthey raise  security significant concerns.  Security significant, too, are Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquent debt missions in the security clearance application he completed in 2005.\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d and place the\nperson \u201cat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and his past failure to address them warrant the\napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations: DC 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations follow an historical pattern.  Before encountering\nfinancial problems with his current spouse, he got into financial difficulty following his\nestrangement from his first spouse and filed for Chapter 13 relief.  Applicant\nsuccessfully completed his Chapter 13 plan, and by itself would be mitigated.  It bears\nconsideration, though, when assessing the security significance of his post-2002\nfinancial set backs. \n Of particular concern are the uncertain financial ramifications of his 2006 home\nforeclosure.  According to Applicant, he obtained 100 per cent financing of the house\nhe purchased in 2005 for $120,000.00.  Quite conceivably, the lender secured the\nmortgage loan with a first trust deed or combined first trust deed and purchase money\nmortgage on the property.  Were this to be the case, and the lender foreclosed non-\njudicially, Applicant quite likely would not have any deficiency liability to potentially\nconfront, regardless of what the home sold for in a foreclosure sale. \n Foreclosure law in Applicant\u2019s state does provide for an action to recover a\ndeficiency for any foreclosed security (by either judicial or non-judicial sale procedures)\nthat does not cover the loan balance at the time of the sale.  See \u00a751.002 of T Property\nCode (2007).  The State\u2019s deficiency statute is time sensitive and requires independent\nlegal actions by the claiming creditor within a specified period of time.  While there is no\nevidence that Applicant\u2019s lender has initiated any legal action to recover a claimed\ndeficiency, it still has ample time to do so. \n Without  any documentation from Applicant about his foreclosure , it is simply\nnot feasible to piece together all of the events associated with his lender\u2019s foreclosure\nto ascertain whether he is at any risk of a creditor action to recover any deficiency\nowing on the loan after crediting proceeds from the public sale of the property.  Absent\nclarifying documentation, Applicant is not well positioned to mitigate security concerns\nover his finances.\n Afforded an opportunity to provide post-hearing documentation about his home\nforeclosure, Applicant has not provided any paperwork covering the legal actions taken\nby the lender.  Nor has he provided any documented payment efforts with respect to\n\n7\nhis other listed creditors.  He provides no proof either of his seeking  financial\ncounseling to explore other ways of discharging his remaining  listed debts. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations of medical debts are plausible and reasonable to a\ndegree.  They certainly show how he incurred medical bills associated with treatment\nfor his wife and youngest daughter.   Extenuating circumstances sufficient to warrant\napplication of MC 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations are somewhat in evidence in this record. \nMitigation credit, though, is not available  to Applicant based on his proofs.\nWithout any credible demonstration of concrete steps (to include financial counseling)\nto absolve himself of any deficiency responsibility on his foreclosed home, and his\nremaining debts covered in the SOR, Applicant does is not in a position to take\nadvantage of any of the remaining  mitigating conditions.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations does not enable Applicant\nto surmount security concerns either.  Documented Applicant efforts to address the\nlisted debts and demonstrate extenuating circumstances, repayment efforts where\nwarranted, and good-faith disputes (if any) all could have had a bearing on Applicant\u2019s\ndemonstrated reliability and trustworthiness, but are not available in this evidentiary\nrecord.   Without more, it is difficult to draw convincing conclusions about Applicant\u2019s\noverall trustworthiness based on factors not covered in the mitigation conditions of the\nguideline for financial considerations.   \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\naccumulated debts, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to his proven\ndebt delinquencies.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.dd of the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s debt omissions\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s documented omitted\ndelinquent debts in the SF-86 he completed in August 2005.  He attributed his\nomissions to haste and his failure to double-check his bills before completing his SF-86\n\n8\nas evidence of his lack of any intent to deliberately mislead the Government.  His\nclaims have merit. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant presents as an essentially honest\nand hardworking applicant who failed to use due diligence in checking his bills to\ndetermine whether any of them fell into the 180 day and 90 day delinquency categories\ncovered in the SF-86.  His SF-86 omissions were not motivated by any deliberate intent\nto mislead the Government, and his omissions are not indicative of any overall trust\nproblem. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s accepted explanations, he may take full advantage of: MC\n17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d\nApplicant is credited with his successful refutation of the allegations of falsification in\nsub-paragraphs 2.a and 2.b of  the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.dd:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n \nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a and 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

In\n1975 at age 16, he was involved in a drug store robbery.  He was sentenced to 30 months and was\nincarcerated for 24 months.  This triggers the Smith Amendment, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1), which\nprohibits the issuance of a security clearance to anyone convicted, sentenced, and serving more than\n12 months incarceration.

I am denying or revoking his clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1).\nClearance is denied.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1, Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application, dated April 12, 2005.\n1\nTr. at 14, 17.\n2\nId. at 14.\n3\nId. at 14-16.\n4\nId. \n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 12, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The Defense Office of Hearings\n1\nand Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required\nby Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on October 6, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security\nconcerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD\nimplemented them effective September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is issued on or after September\n1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this case\nproceed under the new guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 8, 2006, and requested to have a\ndecision without a hearing.  On December 13, 2006, he faxed a letter to DOHA requesting a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on January 31, 2007.  I convened a hearing on February 22, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.  The government offered three exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-3.  Applicant offered one\nexhibit, marked as exhibit A.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 9, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR.  These admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 48-year-old telecommunications analyst employed by a federal contractor.2\nHe married in 1983 and has two teenage children.   He earned an associate\u2019s degree in electrical\n3\nengineering.   He has no prior military service, and he held a secret security clearance from 1996 to\n4\n2000.5\nOn May 31, 1975, at age 16, Applicant entered a drug store with another person.  Applicant\nemerged from the drugstore first, the other person came out, indicated they should leave, and\nApplicant drove his car away.  Applicant then realized a robbery had occurred.  A police cruiser\n\nId. at 25-27.\n6\nSOR, subparagraph 1.a.; and Government Exhibit 3 (FBI, Criminal Justice Record, dated August 26, 2005) at 3.\n7\nSOR, subparagraph 1.b.; and Government Exhibit 3, supra, note 6, at 3.\n8\nTr. at 19-20.\n9\nSOR\n10\nTr. at 20.\n11\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A (Letter from Project Manager, dated February 14, 2007) at 2.\n12\n4\npursued them with lights flashing, and Applicant did not promptly stop, as the passenger pulled a\ngun on him.  He drove off into the woods where the passenger fled.  Applicant stayed with the car.6\nThe police arrested Applicant and charged him with (1) robbery-business-gun-drug store and\n(2) weapon offense handgun, a felony.  It is unclear whether he was charged as a juvenile or adult.\nHe was convicted and sentenced to 30 months confinement.  He served approximately 2 years in a\nstate correctional training center.7\nApplicant was arrested on June 20, 1978, and charged with possession of a hypodermic\nsyringe.  He was fined $25 and $15 court costs.   Since 1978, he has had no arrests or criminal\n8\ncharges made against him.9\nWhen Applicant executed his questionnaire for national security positions (Standard Form\n86), on April 27, 1996, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201c23. Your police record a.\nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?  (Include those under Uniform\nCode of Military Justice).\u201d  He also answered \u201cNo\u201d on a SF 86, executed by him on April 12, 2005,\nwhen he answered the following question: \u201c21. Your police record - felony offenses  For this item,\nreport information regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise\nstricken from the court record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions\nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under\nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7844 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a73607.  Have you ever been charged with or convicted\nof any felony offense?\u201d  He failed to list information about his criminal convictions discussed in the\nprevious section.10\nApplicant answered these questions based on his understanding that because the incident\noccurred when he was 16 years old, his conviction was a juvenile offense.  He did not know that the\nincident would show up as a criminal record on his adult history.  He did not see the police report\nand never did a background check on himself to get any further information about it.11\nApplicant also received letters of support from his current project manager at an insurance\nagency.  She has known Applicant for over 20 years.  She told of his high degree of integrity,\nresponsibility , and ambition.  She recommended him as a team player with good judgement and a\nmature outlook.   Applicant also produced a letter of commendation from the president/CEO of a\n12\nformer employer for outstanding work provided to a government agency.  The CEO stated: \u201cI am\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A (Letter from President/CEO, dated December 2, 1997) at 6.\n13\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A (Pastor\u2019s Letter, dated January 26, 2007) at 1.\n14\nTr. at 30-35.\n15\nId. at 41-42.\n16\n5\nproud to have personnel of your caliber on the team in support of a customer with a very vital world\nwide national defense mission.\u201d13\nApplicant\u2019s pastor stated:\nI appointed him to be head deacon of the church.  He is responsible for the personal\nsupervision of twelve people and has direct responsibility over several other\nministries within the church.  He has proven to be very valuable asset in these\npositions.  The high integrity and dedication that he demonstrates in serving people\nhas dramatically increased his influence with those under his supervision.  His\nattention to details and organizational skills is enabled his areas of ministry to excel.\nI believe that he possesses qualities that make an outstanding leader and person,\nwhich include honesty, integrity, self-discipline, dependability, perseverance,\nconscientiousness, and a strong work ethic.14\nAfter prison, he attended college and received his associates degree.  He has had steady\nemployment, and has worked for a federal contractor the last 11 years without incident.  He started\na real estate development company on the side.  He volunteers with his children\u2019s schools, serving\nas a liaison between a school and a business helping to build a new school.  He donates time to\nnonprofit organizations teaching occupational skills.15\nHis wife also testified:\nThese things that he did in the past were not a hindrance in our life and it was not a\nhindrance in our decision to get married.  My husband is very communicable as far\nas people are concerned, he helps those that need help.  He goes out of his way for\npeople.  I don\u2019t see anything negative in his life that he is still carrying on those same\nold habits as a youth.\nWe do make mistakes when we\u2019re young, and we do regret them as we get older, but\nnot repeating those things that happened when we were young is the most important\nthing.  And to learn from them.  I believe my husband has learned from those\nmistakes that he did when he was younger and he is teaching other people how to not\nmake those mistakes.16\nPOLICIES\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n17\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n18\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n19\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n6\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each Guidelines, the Guidelines are\ndivided into Disqualifying Conditions and Mitigating Conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.  Guidelines \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.17\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n18\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n19\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n20\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n21\n7\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.20\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the Guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n21\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct\nGuidelines \u00b6 30. The Concern. Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nGuidelines \u00b6 31. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime, sentenced to\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less\nthan a year. \nApplicant admitted his criminal conduct, which includes a felony conviction and a minor\nmisdemeanor offense.  He also admitted that because of his felony conviction he was sentenced to\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year and was incarcerated as result of that sentence for more\nthan one year. \nGuidelines \u00b632. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n\n  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 (c) Persons Disqualified From Being Granted Security Clearances.\u2014 A person is described in this\n22\nsubsection if any of the following applies to that person: \n (1) The person has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment\nfor a term exceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year.\n8\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of\ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement; and\n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be mitigated unless, where\nmeritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries of the Military Departments or designee; or the\nDirectors of Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),\nNational Security Agency (NSA), Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) or designee, has\ngranted a waiver.\nApplicant\u2019s only serious crime occurred over 30 years ago when he was 16 years of age.\nThree years later, the court convicted and fined him for a misdemeanor offense.  For nearly 30 years,\nhe has complied with the law and lived a respectable life.  Since that time, he has had no arrests,\ncharges, or convictions.  He has been married to the same woman for 24 years.  He has two teenage\nchildren.\nSince his youthful criminal activity, he received an associate\u2019s degree and has worked for a\nfederal contractor for the past 11 years without incident.  He started a real estate development\ncompany.  He is involved his children\u2019s schools and he served as a liaison between school and a\nbusiness on building new school.  He donates time to nonprofit organizations.\nHis wife testified that his youthful indiscretions were not a hindrance in their decision to\nmarry.  She believes Applicant learned from his mistakes when he was young and he\u2019s teaching other\npeople not to make the same mistakes that he did.\nCharacter witnesses testified to his integrity, work ethic, and honesty.\nBased upon the foregoing evidence, he has successfully rehabilitated himself.  Mitigating\nconditions 32(a) and (d) are applicable.  However, because Applicant was incarcerated for more than\none year, 32(e) does not apply as the Smith Amendment disqualifies him from having a security\nclearance granted or a renewed by the Department of Defense.  I am, therefore, precluded from\ngranting Applicant a security clearance under 31(e) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7986(c)(1).22\n\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(d) Waiver Authority.\u2014 In a meritorious case, an exception to the prohibition in subsection (a) may\n23\nbe authorized for a person described in paragraph (1) or (4) of subsection (c) if there are mitigating factors.  Any such\nwaiver may be authorized only in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed by, or under the authority of,\nan Executive order or other guidance issued by the President.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App.\n24\nBd. Jun 9, 2004).\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n25\n9\nThat law also provides that in a meritorious case, the Secretary of Defense may authorize an\nexception to this prohibition.23\nPersonal Conduct\nGuidelines \u00b615. The Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuidelines \u00b616. Conditions that raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant denies that he deliberately falsified his answers to the questions on his SF 86,\narguing that the major criminal activity occurred when he was 16 years of age.  When a falsification\nallegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission,\nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission\noccurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind\nat the time the omission occurred.   The government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission,\n24\nconcealment, or falsification in his answers was deliberate.  Even though he was a juvenile, the\nrecord is not clear whether he was tried as an adult.  Based upon his experience, his belief that this\ncrime would not appear on records because he was a juvenile is a reasonable assumption for him to\nmake.  I find that his omissions are honest mistakes, and were not deliberately made with the intent\nto mislead the government.  I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n25\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\n\nId.\n26\nId.\n27\n10\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n26\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (48),\n27\nhis education, his employment, and his good record since 1978.  Even though he did not correctly\nanswers two security clearance applications, I find it was not deliberate.  His record since he was a\nteenager has been circumspect.  He has a stable marriage, he is actively involved with his children,\ntheir schools, and his church.  He has had stable employment.  \nI observed Applicant during the hearing, and especially during his testimony.  I find his\ntestimony to be believable and find him to be a sincere and credible witness, because he answered\nquestions directly, completely, and honestly.  The totality of the record raises no reasonable or\npersistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its\ninterests.\nI would grant Applicant a security clearance except for the prohibition stated in 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7986, which precludes me from doing so.  I am denying or revoking his clearance solely as a result\nof 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1).\nApplicant has requested a waiver pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(d).  I have no authority to grant\na waiver.  See DOHA OPERATING INSTRUCTION No. 64, dated September 12, 2006, at 1-3.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\n1\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on September 18, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security\nconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nof the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (RAG) on December 30, 2005.\nDoD implemented them effective September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the RAG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is issued on or after September\n1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this case\nproceed under the new guidelines.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 14, 2006,\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on\nDecember 18, 2006.  The Notice of Hearing, dated January 26, 2007, was issued to convene a\nhearing on February 14, 2007,   to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\n2\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The government offered five exhibits,\nmarked as exhibits 1-5, received without objection.  Applicant offered no exhibits.  DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 23, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all of the allegations contained in SOR except subparagraph 1.s.  Her\nadmission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact.  I make the following additional findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is a 58-year-old armed security officer employed by a federal contractor.   She has\n3\nbeen divorced since 1985, has three emancipated children, and is a high school graduate.   This is\n4\nher first application for a security clearance.5\nApplicant accumulated $35,383 of unpaid debt, which included $13,787 for a deficiency on\na repossessed automobile, and another debt of $11,569 which she does not recognize as her\n\nSOR\n6\nTr.  at 32.\n7\nId. at 33.\n8\nPreeclampsia is a disorder that occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period and affects both the mother and\n9\nthe unborn baby.

She also had a state tax lien of $2,854.  She indicated she would be contacting the\n6\ntaxing authority to make repayment arrangements.   The total delinquent debts were $38,237.\n7\nMany of the debts were incurred because of a daughter\u2019s serious illness.  After delivering a\nbaby, on January 14, 2004, Applicant\u2019s daughter lapsed into a coma lasting from January 16, 2004,\nto August 2006,  as a result of preeclampsia.   Also, her kidneys and liver shut down and her weight\n8\n9\ndropped from 145 pounds to 79 pounds after the baby was born.  Eighteen doctors provided care.\nApplicant was working 16, to sometimes 18 hours a day in one city, then driving back to her\nhometown to check on her daughter and granddaughter (a distance of about 130 miles each way).\nShe had no family that could provide financial assistance.  During this time her car was repossessed.\nAfter her daughter recovered, she helped provide living quarters for her daughter and granddaughter.\nShe made sure that her granddaughter had day care.  Her daughter now requires an occupational\nphysical therapist because of a stroke that put her into a coma and caused her left side to be\nparalyzed.   Applicant did what she thought was right and paid the bills she felt were most\n10\nimportant.  As a result of a denial of her security clearance, she lost her job.11\nOn November 14, 2006, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  She attended her\ndischarge hearing on December 20, 2006.   With the filing of her completion certificate for a\n12\nrequired financial management course on February 7, 2007, Applicant was waiting to receive her\ndischarge order canceling the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.r.13\nApplicant falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), executed by her on November 14, 2005.  Her response to question \u201c27: Your\nFinancial Record b.  In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any property\nrepossessed for any reason?\u201d, she answered \u201cNo.\u201d  She failed to list the repossession as set forth in\nSOR subparagraph 1.g.  \nOn the same form, Applicant listed only two but not all debts in response to question \u201c28.\nYour financial delinquencies b.  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?  She\n\nId. at 32.\n14\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n15\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n16\n5\nlisted the debts set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.o. and 1.p., but failed to disclose the delinquent\ndebts set forth in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.n, 1.q., and 1.r.  Applicant claimed she could not\nremember all of the debts and only listed the two that she could remember.14\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each Guidelines, the Guidelines are\ndivided into Disqualifying Conditions and Mitigating Conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guidelines \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.15\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n16\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n17\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n18\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n19\n6\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n17\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.18\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the Guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n19\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems.  \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\n\n7\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d \nTwo Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a\ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts,\u201d and \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 19(a) and (c).\nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline \u00b6 20(a), (c),\nand (e) do not apply.  The debts continued to be delinquent until recently, there is no evidence of\nApplicant seeking counseling, and there is no basis to dispute most of the indebtedness.  However,\nGuideline \u00b6 20 (b) and (d) are applicable.  The financial problems resulted from the serious and\ncontinuing illness and disability of her daughter and Applicant\u2019s need to assist her child and\ngrandchild with adequate living facilities.  Compounding the problem was the repossession of her\ncar during a time when she was commuting 130 miles each way to work.  An additional hardship\nwas caused by the loss of her job because of the denial of her security clearance.\nApplicant otherwise resolved her debts by filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  With the\ndebts eliminated in bankruptcy, she is left only with the state tax lien of $2854.  She indicated she\nwould make payment arrangements with the taxing authority, and I believe she will repay this\nobligation.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 15.\n20\n8\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 15, \u201cconduct involving...lack of candor [or] dishonesty...can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process....\u201d  One personal conduct disqualifying condition is particularly relevant\nand may be disqualifying in this case.  Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides, \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nThe concern under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is that conduct involving questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard sensitive\ninformation.\u201d   Applicant\u2019s SF 86 had incorrect answers to questions 27 and 28.  However,\n20\nApplicant denied that she intentionally falsified the answers by not including most of her delinquent\ndebts.  She claimed she did not remember them at the time she completed the application in\nNovember 2005. However, based on my review of the record, including her truthful disclosure of\nthe automobile repossession, two delinquent debts, and her comment in the Remarks section that the\ncredit report showed other debts were paid, in addition to her strong denial of the falsification\nallegation, I believe Applicant\u2019s omissions were negligent and not intentional.  Hence, the evidence\ndoes not establish deliberate falsification. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant has made progress resolving her debts and appears committed to paying the state tax lien.\nShe is 58 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her obligations.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and all of the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated the security concerns\npertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct.  I have no concerns about her reliability,\njudgment, and honesty.  The totality of the circumstances and her actions in light of the hardships\nshe encountered lead me to conclude she is a person of character.  This record raises no reasonable\nand persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect sensitive information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its\ninterests.  I find Guideline F and Guideline E for Applicant, and conclude it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue her security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n9\nParagraph 1.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nBobby L. Warren, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nIn 2002, while employed in a foreign country, Applicant engaged in an extramarital affair\nwith a foreign national prompting his reassignment to another position. He was not forthcoming\nabout the circumstances of the reassignment when interviewed by an investigative agent in 2006.\nThis creates personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns which he failed to mitigate at\nthe hearing. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1992, as amended. Applicant answered the SOR on December 20, 2006. On January 26, 2007,\nApplicant submitted an addendum to his Answer, requesting an administrative determination. On\nFebruary 8, 2007, the government requested a hearing. \nOn June 21, 2007, the case was assigned to me. On July 6, 2007, a hearing notice was issued,\nscheduling the hearing for July 31, 2007. At the hearing, I received four government exhibits and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on August 8, 2007. \nPROCEDURAL RULING\nThe government filed a motion to amend the SOR on June 6, 2007. The original SOR alleges\nApplicant failed to disclose the circumstances of his departure from a job in 2002. It contains one\nsubparagraph describing five allegation of employer misconduct set forth under five sub-allegations\nlisted as subparagraphs 1.a(1)(a) through 1.a(1)(e). Also, it is alleged under two adjudicative\nguidelines.\nThe proposed amended SOR alleges each act of employee misconduct separately under\nsubparagraph 1.b(1) through 1.b(5). Also, it alleges an additional personal conduct allegation\n(subparagraph 1.c), and eight additional criminal conduct allegations (subparagraphs 2.b through 2.i).\nApplicant did not object to the amendment, and I granted the motion. I ordered department\ncounsel to submit a new SOR consolidating the original SOR and the amendments. On August 6,\n2007, he did so. I used the Amended SOR throughout the decision when referencing the various\nallegations.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations except subparagraphs 1.a.(1)(a), 1.a.(1)(d), 1.b.(1),\nand 2.b.(4).These admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\n\nExhibit 4, Supervisor\u2019s E-mail Memorandum, dated August 17, 2003.\n1\n3\nApplicant is a 57-year-old  man who has been married for 30 years. He earned a GED in the\nearly 1970s, and has been working as a master plumber since approximately 1976. For the past 10\nyears, he has worked for several defense contractors on various overseas assignments where he has\nbeen involved in installing plumbing and building water treatment plants at military installations (Tr.\n36).\nWhile stationed on one assignment in the summer of 2002, Applicant grew romantically\ninvolved with a local woman. As the relationship progressed, he began meeting her for coffee during\nworking hours, socializing with her at establishments that his employer had explicitly designated as\n\u201coff limits\u201d (Answer; Tr. 43), and lavishing her with gifts including a stereo, a television, and other\nelectronic equipment (Tr. 45). Also, he found an apartment for her, and paid the rent (Answer; Tr.\n48).\nDuring the six months Applicant dated the foreign national, they went on vacation several\ntimes to a nearby country where they spent their time drinking and having \u201cfun\u201d at parties (Tr. 44).\nOn one occasion, Applicant and his mistress caroused naked with several other female foreign\nnationals from the other country, \u201cand there were several pictures taken.\u201d(Tr. 44). Shortly after\nApplicant and his mistress returned from vacation, they had an argument. He demanded that she\nreturn the electronic equipment he had purchased for her, and she refused (Id.). Then, he said, \u201cI bet\n[y]our brother sure would like to see some of these pictures\u201d (Tr. 45). The mistress \u201cwas a Muslim\ngirl,\u201d (Tr. 45), and if her family had known what she was doing \u201cit would have been kind of a\ndisgrace\u201d (Tr. 95).\nThe mistress then filed a complaint to the region\u2019s United Nations (UN) administrator who\n\u201ccalled [Applicant] in for a little counseling\u201d (Id.). The administrator cautioned Applicant that his\nstatement could be construed as extortion or blackmail, and ordered him to give him the pictures\n(Id.). \nIn February 2002, Applicant\u2019s employer terminated his assignment. The specific reasons were\nas follows:1\n1. Falsification of timesheet\n2. . . . fraternization with a local national female\n3. Violation of Project Policy #3: Visiting \u201cOff Limits\u201d establishments\n4. Violation of [Employer] and NATO policy: Alleged use of blackmail  . . . [and]\n5. Violation of Project Policy: Rented an off military installation apartment.\nApplicant was not allowed to return to this particular theater, but was allowed to work for his\nemployer anywhere else (Tr. 45). Approximately two years ago, after several successive jobs at\nvarious embassies, he returned to work for the employer with whom he had worked in 2002 (Tr. 51-\n55). He has not committed any additional workplace-related misconduct.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in July 2004. He answered \u201cNo\u201d in\nresponse to Question 20 (Your Employment Record   Has any of the following happened to you in\nthe past 7 years -Fired from job - Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired -Left a job by mutual\n\n4\nagreement following allegations of misconduct - Left a job by mutual agreement following\nallegations of unsatisfactory performance - Left a job for other reason under unfavorable\ncircumstances). In 2006, Applicant met with a security clearance investigator, and was asked about\nthe circumstances of his departure from the job in February 2002. He told the agent that it occurred\nbecause his employer was reducing its workload, and he was seen as a threat to his supervisor (Tr.\n16 - Answer to Amended SOR).\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct. In 1969, a domestic dispute with his then-wife\nled to an arrest and battery charge. Because he was arrested in a county other than where the alleged\nbattery occurred, he was charged as a foreign prisoner. The charge was later dismissed (Tr. 86).\nIn 1970, Applicant was charged and convicted of driving while intoxicated (DUI). He served\nfour days of a nine-month sentence to imprisonment and was released (Tr. 89).\nIn 1976, Applicant was in a car accident. Because several empty beer cans were in the car,\nhe was charged with DUI. He was later acquitted (Tr. 59).\nIn 1984, Applicant was confronted by the husband of a woman with whom he was having\nan affair (Tr. 66). The husband later pressed charges against him for sexual assault. At a subsequent\nhearing, Applicant pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of simple assault, and paid a fine (Tr. 66).\nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in 1990. He pleaded guilty, resulting in a fine\nand two years probation (Tr. 17 - Answer to Amended SOR). In 2002, he was arrested and charged\nwith DUI. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 days in jail, had his driver\u2019s license suspended\nfor one year, and was fined (Tr. 17 - Answer to Amended SOR). \nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2)the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n2\n5\nGuideline E -Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n2\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s extramarital relationship with a foreign national in 2002 while working overseas,\nhis comments to the mistress when the relationship began to deteriorate, and his corresponding\nemployment-related misconduct generate a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) 16 (e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. His omission of the\ncircumstances surrounding his departure from the 2002 position from his security clearance\napplication, and his mischaracterization of it to an investigative agent in 2006 raise the issue of\nwhether PC DC 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, and PC DC 16 (b): deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative, apply.\nApplicant did not leave the job in 2002. Instead, he left a particular project. His employer told\nhim he was welcome to work on projects anywhere other than the region from which he was being\nreassigned. PC 16(a) is not applicable, and I conclude he did not falsify Question 20 of the 2004\nsecurity clearance application.\n\n6\nConversely, when an investigative agent asked Applicant to explain the circumstances of his\ndeparture, he deliberately mischaracterized it. PC DC 16(b) applies without mitigation to the\nstatements made to the agent.\nApplicant\u2019s employment-related misconduct occurred more than five years ago. He has\nworked abroad on several successive occasions, and has not committed any similar infractions\ninvolving foreign nationals. These positive factors are substantially outweighed by the nature of the\nviolation and the subsequent failure to disclose it to an investigative agent. None of the mitigating\nconditions apply. Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security concern.\nCriminal Conduct\nFor the reasons set forth above, Applicant\u2019s response to Question 20 of the security clearance\napplication does not constitute criminal conduct under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001, and his response to the\nagent during the 2006 interview does constitute criminal conduct under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001.\nMost of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred more than 20 years ago. When considered in\nconjunction with the 2006 falsification to the agent and the 2002 DUI, it reflects a longstanding\npattern of criminal behavior that remains a security concern. Applicant has not mitigated the criminal\nconduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant engaged in an extramarital affair with a foreign national of a country where he was\nworking in 2002. During the course of the affair, he violated several company policies. Also, his\ncomments to her as the relationship deteriorated prompted a complaint to the country\u2019s UN\nadministrator.\nApplicant was 52 years old when this conduct occurred. Consequently, neither youth nor\nimmaturity are mitigating factors. This was not the first time an extramarital affair led to legal\nproblems. Therefore, although he has not been involved in similar conduct since the incident, an\nunacceptably high possibility of recurrence remains. Most importantly, he misled an investigative\nagent by failing to disclose this conduct when asked why  the 2002 job assignment was terminated.\nEvaluating this case in light of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant remains a security\nrisk. Clearance is denied. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force from 1987 through 1991. After his discharge, he worked for defense contractors and for a hospital staff, performing information systems implementation. In 1998 he started a consulting firm. Although adept at marketing his business and at customer service, Applicant was less so at managing his firm\u2019s finances and fell into debt. Since starting his business, his health coverage has been \u201csporadic\u201d and he has had difficulty distinguishing those bills that were the responsibility of his insurance provider and those that were to be paid by him.

Blank, Jr.,Esq.,  Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nGary A. Matthews, Esq., Arnold J.

On August 22, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n\nDecision at 3.  \n1\nDirective E2.A6.1.3.6.  \u201cThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n2\nresolve debts.\u201d  \nSee, e.g., the accountant\u2019s favorable opinion of the long range prospects for Applicant\u2019s business.  Tr. at 242.\n3\n2\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 18, 2007,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Guideline F mitigating conditions is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s favorable conclusions under Guidelines E and J are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nFinding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant served in the U.S. Air\nForce from 1987 through 1991.  After his discharge, he worked for defense contractors and for a\nhospital staff, performing information systems implementation.  In 1998 he started a consulting firm.\nAlthough adept at marketing his business and at customer service, Applicant was less so at managing\nhis firm\u2019s finances and fell into debt.  Since starting his business, his health coverage has been\n\u201csporadic\u201d and he has had difficulty distinguishing those bills that were the responsibility of his\ninsurance provider and those that were to be paid by him.   He also has owed a substantial amount\n1\nof money for state taxes.  When asked on his security clearance application (SCA) whether he had\ndelinquent debts of 180 days and 90 days respectively, Applicant answered in the negative.

The Judge noted that, while Applicant did not list his tax debt under\nquestions 38 and 39, he did list it in response to question 36, which inquired as to the existence of\nany liens against him.  Moreover, Applicant reasonably explained that he was confused as to which\nmedical bills were his responsibility and which were those of his insurance provider, which supports\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that his answers to the questions at issue were made in good faith, even if\nthey were erroneous.  The Board also notes that Applicant listed an unpaid judgement against him\nin response to question 37, which further supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was not\nintending to deceive.  Applicant\u2019s answers, viewed as a whole, do not demonstrate an intent to hide\nhis difficulties.

She has contacted\nother creditors and negotiated payment plans but did not provide proof that she has actually made\nany payments. Applicant received $18,000 in severance pay when she was honorably discharged\nfrom the Army in 2004. She did not use the money to repay her debts, and none of the severance pay\nremains. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 21, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nJanuary 4, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned\nto me on March 5, 2007. With the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on April 16, 2007, to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. The Government offered three exhibits that were marked as GE 1-3 and\nadmitted without objections. Applicant testified on her behalf and offered eight exhibits that were\nmarked as AE A-H and were admitted without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) on April 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 41 years old. She has worked as a librarian for a federal contractor since January\n2005. She served in the Army for more than 16 years.  She was released from the Army due to her\n1\nfailure to provide a family care plan.  This plan is a requirement for all dual active duty couples to\n2\nensure their children are properly cared for in the event both parents are deployed. Applicant did not\nprovide an explanation for why she and her husband did not execute a plan.  She was honorably\n3\ndischarged in the rank of sergeant, and received $18,000 in severance pay. Her husband remains on\n\nTr. 35.\n4\nTr. 41.\n5\nTr. 38.\n6\nTr. 39-40.\n7\nTr. 41-42.\n8\nId.\n9\nTr. 43.\n10\nAE A and B.\n11\nTr. 47.\n12\nTr. 47-48.\n13\nTr. 50.\n14\n3\nactive duty. Upon Applicant\u2019s release from active duty in March 2004, she was unemployed until\nJanuary 2005.  She lives on post in government housing. She operates a home business and earns\n4\napproximately $500 a month in income.5\nApplicant has a 14 year old son from a previous marriage and a six year old child with her\npresent husband. She and her husband were married in 2002. He deployed to South Korea in\nDecember 2003, has voluntarily extended his deployment, and remains overseas.  Applicant and her\n6\nhusband have been separated since 2004, and she is planning on obtaining a divorce. She does not\nreceive, nor has she not sought child support from him or assistance from his command to receive\nit. She has not sought military legal assistance to assist her in obtaining support from her husband.7\nShe has not sought any legal advice. Once she is divorced she will no longer be authorized\ngovernment housing. \nThe delinquent debts listed in SOR 1.a and 1.b are for credit cards that Applicant obtained\nin her own name prior to her marriage and are not held jointly.  Both debts were charged off in 2001,\n8\nwhile Applicant was still in the Army and receiving pay.  She did not have a reason for not paying\n9\nthe debts.  On March 28, 2007 and April 13, 2007,  she reached a settlement agreement on the\n10\n11\ndebts. She claimed she has made one payment so far on 1.a, but did not provide supporting\nverification.  She has not made any payments on 1.b, but stated she would begin with a $50 payment\n12\non April 18, 2007. The settlement calls for $146.66, but she stated that based on an oral agreement\nshe will make a $50 payment for a period of time.  \n13\nThe delinquent debt in SOR 1.c is for the deficiency on a car that she and her husband\npurchased jointly in May 2002.  The original loan was for $33,000. She and her husband defaulted\n14\non the loan and owe approximately $22,000. She stated when she was released from active duty in\nMarch 2004, she could not afford to make the car payments. She stated she contacted the creditor\nand requested they take the car back. She has not yet returned the car and still has it in her\n\nTr. 53.\n15\nTr. 55.\n16\nTr. 56, 6364\n17\nGE 1 at page 5. \n18\nTr. 65-66.\n19\nTr. 58-59.\n20\nTr. 60-61\n21\nTr. 68.\n22\nAE C.\n23\nTr. 69.\n24\nId.\n25\nTr. 61.\n26\nTr. 61-62.\n27\n4\npossession. She has not made a payment on it since December 2004.  She could not provide an\n15\nexplanation for why when she started work on January 2005, she did not resume car payments.  She\n16\nstated her intention was to contact the creditor and relinquish the car, but she has not. She received\na letter in January 2007 from the collection agency for the creditor, but she has not responded to\nthem either.  On her security clearance application (SCA) in response to question 38 requesting\n17\ninformation on any debts over 180 days, she indicated she incurred a car loan with the creditor on\nNovember 15, 2004, and it was satisfied on January 1, 2005 for $1,500.  She made no mention that\n18\nshe was actually delinquent in her payments and had actually defaulted on the loan. She did not have\nan explanation for why she put that information on her SCA and was evasive in her responses.19\nApplicant and her husband bought a second vehicle and she has made timely payments on it.  She\n20\npresently has two vehicles that she pays insurance on. She used part of her severance pay for a down\npayment on the second vehicle.21\nThe delinquent debt in SOR 1.d is for a computer Applicant purchased in 1995. She could\nnot recall when she defaulted on this debt.  On April 10, 2007, she reached a settlement agreement\n22\nwith the creditor to pay a lump sum of $2,000 to satisfy this debt.  She stated she is to pay $1,000\n23\non April 18, 2007 and $1,000 on May 18, 2007.  The settlement agreement does not reflect this\n24\npayment plan.25\nOf the $18,000 Applicant received in severance pay upon being discharged from the service,\nshe also put approximately $10,000 of it in savings at the time and also spent some of it on toys for\nher children and \u201cstupid stuff\u201d.  She did not use it to make her car payments.  While unemployed,\n26\n27\nApplicant and her husband bought a truck in April 2004. She pays $226 a month. Her husband does\nnot contribute to the payments. She used some of her severance pay for the down payment on the\n\nTr. 81-83.\n28\nTr. 83-84.\n29\nAE D and G.\n30\nAE D\n31\nAE E.\n32\nAE E and F.\n33\nAE H.\n34\nDepartment of the Navy v.

She received a $4,000 refund from her 2006 tax return. She\nloaned her sister $2,000. Her sister is supposed to begin repaying her $100 a month, but she has not\nreceived the first payment. Applicant has three credit cards and makes monthly payments on them.28\nOne card she owes approximately $6,000. She purchased appliances and two televisions, one for her\nroom and one for her child\u2019s room.  \n29\nApplicant\u2019s coworkers believe her to be \u201ctop notch.\u201d  She is considered trustworthy,\n30\ndependable and a worthy valued employee.  She is considered a \u201cself-starter\u201d who assumes\n31\nresponsibility for her projects ad completes tasks because they \u201cneed to be done.\u201d  She is believed\n32\nto have a strong work ethic and has excellent rapport with those whom she works.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n42\n6\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n40\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n41\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.42\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F-Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\n7\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or\nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt), and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has debts that have been delinquent for many years and\nshe has not taken any action on them until after she received her SOR. She had the means to resolve\nher delinquencies when she received $18,000 in severance pay after being discharged from service.\nShe admitted she spent the money irresponsibly on \u201cstupid stuff.\u201d One debt she has owed since 1995\nand was working when she incurred it. She has no plan for how she is going to repay the deficiency\non one of her cars.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nApplicant still owes the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. She has contacted some\ncreditors and negotiated payment plans, but has not provided proof that she has actually made\npayments. All of her actions were taken subsequent to receiving the SOR. One of her debts dates\nback to 1995 and others were charged off in 2001. I find FC MC 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant is separated from her husband and does not receive support. However, she incurred\nsome of the debts prior to her marriage and while employed with the Army. She also received a large\nseverance payment that she could have used responsibly, but admittedly did not. Her financial\nproblems were not created by conditions beyond her control. Therefore, I find FC MC 20(b) does\nnot apply. Applicant did not provide any information that she is receiving financial counseling. She\ndid provide some evidence that she has contacted some creditors to work out resolving her debts.\nThis action was taken only recently and she failed to show she has made payments on the plan. Her\nlargest debt remains unpaid and she has not contacted the creditor to resolve it. Based on all the\nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s spending habits, I do not find there are clear indications the problem\nis under control and Applicant has in good faith attempted to resolve all of her debts. I find FC MC\n20(c) and (d) do not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\n\n8\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. Applicant received high praises from her coworkers\nas a mature, dependable and trusty employee. She has a delinquent debt dating back to 1995 that\nremains unpaid. She incurred some of her debts while she was employed and received a large\nseverance payment that she spent irresponsibly. Applicant did not make any effort to resolve her\ndelinquent debts until her security clearance became an issue. She had the money in the past to repay\nmost of her debts, but chose to spend it on other things. After weighing the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns based on her financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended. (Directive).\nItem 5, Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated September 28, 2005, at 24.\n2\nId. at 9, 11.\n3\nItem 4, Answer, dated September 11, 2006, at 1.\n4\nId.\n5\n2\nBetween approximately 2002 and 2005, Applicant accrued two debts totaling\napproximately$25,000, which generates a security concern. Although circumstances beyond her\ncontrol contributed in part to these delinquencies, she failed to demonstrate that she has taken any\nconcrete steps to resolve them. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 25, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  Applicant answered it on September 15,\n1\n2006, admitting all of the allegations and electing to have the case decided on the written record.\nDepartment Counsel mailed the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant\non February 28, 2007. She received it on March 9, 2007, and neither objected to its contents nor\nsubmitted any materials in response to it. The case was assigned to me on April 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI have incorporated Applicants admissions into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old married woman with two children and two stepchildren, all of\nwhom are teenagers. She is a U.S. Army veteran who served from 1994 to 1996. She was honorably\ndischarged.  She has worked for her employer in the production support field since 2005, and has\n2\nbeen working toward a college degree since 2004.3\nApplicant\u2019s current spouse is her second husband. At or about the time they married in\nJanuary 2001, they lived in a mobile home. Upon moving to a larger home, they were unable to sell\nthe mobile home, and were compelled to rent it in order to pay the mortgage.  Two years later, the\n4\nrenters moved, Applicant fell behind on mortgage payments, and it was voluntarily repossessed.5\nCurrently, she owes approximately $22,099 on the delinquent mortgage.\n\nId.\n6\nId. at 2.\n7\n3\nIn June 2005, Applicant was laid off from her job.  Although she obtained a new job without\n6\nexperiencing an employment gap, it paid substantially less than the prior job. Consequently, she grew\ndelinquent on payments owed to a credit card company, as referenced in SOR subparagraph 1.b.\nCurrently, she owes $3,181. \nApplicant recently earned a promotion to a higher paying job, and intends to repay her debts\n\u201cas soon as possible.\u201d  She provided no evidence that she has made any payments or organized a\n7\npayment plan.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding\nwhether to deny or revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information\n(disqualifying conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an\nindividual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (mitigating conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, rules of law.\nInstead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in\nconjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2.,\nEnclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair,\ncommon sense decisions.\nBecause the entire process involves an evaluation of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The Adjudicative\nProcess factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature and seriousness of\nthe conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the\nage of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was\nnegligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or\npresence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or\nrecur in the future.\nI find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this\ncase:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\nSee Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2. \n8\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n8\nthat are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have\navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies, accrued between 2003 and 2005 trigger the applicability of\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).\nApplicant\u2019s inability to sell her mobile home after she relocated in 2001, and her reduced income after\na downsizing in 2005 were the principal cause of her delinquencies. Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation)) applies.\nAlthough Applicant asserted that her finances were improving, she provided no evidence.\nMoreover, because she has yet to make any debt repayments, her contention that she intends to repay\nthem in the future has little probative value. I have considered the other mitigating conditions and\nconclude none apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant deserves credit for her service to the country in the Army, and has demonstrated\ngood character by returning to college, later in life, to obtain a degree. Her financial problems were\nexacerbated by her inability to sell her mobile home upon relocating in 2001 and an employment\ndownsizing in 2005. Nevertheless, she had a responsibility to provide concrete evidence supporting\nher contention that these delinquencies will be satisfied in the future. She failed to do so. Absent such\n\nDirective \u00b6E2.2.1.6.\n9\nDirective \u00b6E2.2.1.9.\n10\n5\nevidence, the issue of rehabilitation  remains in doubt, and the likelihood of continuation or\n9\nrecurrence  remains unacceptably high. Clearance is denied.\n10\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not\nrehabilitate her finances in a manner necessary to justify the award of a DoD security clearance.\nShould she be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, and were to\narrange a satisfactory repayment plan with her creditors to repay the delinquent accounts, she may\nwell demonstrate persuasive evidence of security worthiness. That time has not yet arrived, however.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Le\u2019i, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has approximately $12,500.00 in unsecured debt that has been past-due for many\nyears. There is little to no chance she will be in a position to satisfy this debt anytime soon.\n\n2\nClearance is denied.\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 19, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992,  issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 3, 2006, and elected to have her case determined\non a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written\ncase (FORM) on or about November 13, 2006. Applicant filed a response to the FORM on or about\nDecember 1, 2006. The case was assigned to me on December 27, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 27 years of age. She has been with her current defense contractor employer since\nOctober 2005.\nSOR Allegation 1a: Applicant is indebted to Medcah, Inc. in the approximate amount of\n$400.00. This debt went delinquent and was referred for collection in about June 2003.\nSOR Allegation 1b: This $9.00 returned check fee debt was referred for collection in 2003.\nIt was recently satisfied.\nSOR Allegation 1c: Applicant is indebted to Bank of America in the approximate amount\nof $5,339.00. This debt went delinquent and was charged off in 2003.\nSOR Allegation 1d: Applicant is indebted to Target NB in the approximate amount of\n$511.00. This debt went delinquent and was charged off in 2003.\nSOR Allegation 1e: Applicant is indebted to Capital One Bank in the approximate amount\nof $871.00. This debt went delinquent and was charged off in 2003.\nSOR Allegation 1f: Applicant is indebted to GEMB/JC Penney in the approximate amount\nof $219.00. This account went delinquent and was charged off in 2004.\nSOR Allegation 1g: Applicant is indebted to Credit Service in the approximate amount of\n$921.00. This debt went delinquent and was referred for collection in about August 2005.\nSOR Allegation 1h: Applicant is indebted to Credit Systems, Inc. in the approximate amount\nof $2,727.00. This account went delinquent and was referred for collection in about September 2005.\n\nResponse to FORM.\n1\nResponse to FORM.\n2\nSeparation Agreement attached to Response to Form.\n3\n3\nSOR Allegation 1i: Applicant is indebted to AWA Collection in the approximate amount\nof $862.00. This debt originated with Nextel Partners, and was referred to AWA Collection by\nNextel Partners for collection in about October 2005.\nSOR Allegation 1j: Applicant is indebted to AFNI, Inc. in the approximate amount of\n$683.00. This debt originated with Nextel, and was referred to AFNI, Inc. by Nextel for collection\nin about May 2006. \nSOR Allegation 1k: Because the name of the creditor was not provided to applicant in the\nSOR, this allegation is found for applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in October 2002 when her husband walked out on her\nand her son. At the time she had \u201cno money no job and credit card debt in [her] name already.\u201d   She\n1\nhad no choice but to use her credit cards \u201cto get food and to cover everyday living expenses.\u201d  When\n2\nthey legally separated February 2003, he agreed to pay her $520.00 a month in support.  She received\n3\njust one payment from him.\nSince their separation, applicant has had periods of underemployment and unemployment,\nas well as medical problems, all of which contributed to her inability to satisfy her past-due financial\nobligations. She now believes she is in the position where she can begin to repay this past-due debt.\nShe intends to take care of all of her debts within the next year.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that (1) applicant has been experiencing significant financial\ndifficulties since 2003, (2) she is still indebted to numerous creditors for past-due debts in the\napproximate total amount of $12,500.00,  and (3) despite the optimism she expressed about her\nability to begin satisfying these past-due financial obligations, there is little to no chance she will be\nin a position to satisfy them anytime soon. Disqualifying Conditions 19a. (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and 19c.(a history of not meeting financial obligations) are applicable.\nApplicant offered credible evidence that her financial problems were caused by her marital\nseparation and her husband\u2019s refusal to honor his obligation to pay her monthly support.\nAccordingly, Mitigating Condition 20a. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control, e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances) is applicable.\nAt the present time, applicant is clearly experiencing significant financial difficulties.\n\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, Page 30, Paragraph 18, The Concern.\n4\n4\nAlthough factors beyond her control caused these financial difficulties, the fact remains her present\nsituation fits squarely within one of the primary concerns expressed in the Financial Considerations\nsection of the Directive, to wit: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.   Based on this fact, I have no choice but to conclude it is\n4\nnot now clearly consistent with the national interest for applicant to have access to classified\ninformation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On October 18, 2007, after reviewing the record,\nAdministrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn her appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge should have given more consideration to the\nmitigating evidence Applicant supplied as to her personal circumstances and her efforts to repay her\ndebts.  Applicant maintains that she submitted paperwork to an investigator in February 2006 which\nwas not included in the file of relevant material (FORM).\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant restates her personal circumstances at the time her financial\nproblems arose, but adds some personal information which was not part of the FORM, including\nmore recent efforts to pay off her debts.  The Board is unable to consider the additional personal and\nfinancial information that was not part of the FORM, because the Board cannot consider new\nevidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider information regarding payment plans\nbetween Applicant and her creditors, which Applicant submitted to the investigator in February\n2006.  The Judge\u2019s decision was based entirely on the FORM.  In August 2007, Applicant received\na copy of the FORM and had the opportunity to submit materials to further refute, extenuate, or\nmitigate the information in the FORM.  At that time, Applicant could have resubmitted any materials\nshe gave to the investigator which were not in the FORM when she received it.  Applicant did not\nrespond to the FORM.  Applicant has not demonstrated error on this issue.\nApplicant argues that the Judge should have concluded that her financial situation was\nmitigated.  However, the application of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-12032 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2007).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \n\n3\nIn her decision, the Judge refers to Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances and to the comments\nApplicant made about her financial situation in response to DOHA Interrogatories in October 2006.\nThe Judge explained why Applicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation was not sufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple   \nMichael D.

He\nalso committed criminal conduct during that period. Applicant has not used any illegal substance or\n\n2\nconsumed any alcoholic beverage since May 2004, and has no intention to in the future.   Mitigation\nhas been shown. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 24,  2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and\nmodified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons under\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether clearance should be granted or denied.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, notarized on  November 16, 2006, Applicant responded to\nthe SOR allegations (RSOR). He requested that his case be decided on a hearing record.\nOn February 7, 2007, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision, but it was reassigned to this Administrative Judge on March\n28, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on May 29, 2007, and the hearing was\nconducted on June 12, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Government\nExhibits 1 through 7) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered two documentary exhibits\n(Applicant Exhibits A and B), and offered his own testimony. Exhibit A was a series of three letters\nthat were on a disc and he was going to submit after the hearing All of the documents have been\nentered into evidence. The transcript (Tr) was received on June 21, 2007. The record was held open\nuntil June 26, 2007, to allow Applicant to offer additional documents, which he has done. None of\nthese additional documents have been objected to, and they have been marked collectively as Exhibit\nC and admitted into evidence. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the SOR.  The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a. and  1.b., under Guideline\nH (Drug Involvement), two allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and two\nallegation, 3.a. and 3.b., under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). In the RSOR Applicant\nadmitted all of the SOR allegations except 2.b. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \n\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. Applicant is not married,\nand he has two sons and one daughter.\nApplicant was in the United States Coast Guard from November 1988 through March 1994,\nwhen he received an Honorable Discharge. He also served in the United States Army National Guard\nin 1996 and 1997, from which he also received an Honorable Discharge.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has abused illegal substances. \n1.a. Applicant used amphetamines with varying frequency from approximately 1995 until at\nleast October 2003. \n1.b. Applicant attended an inpatient alcohol treatment program, first from December 2003\nuntil February 2004, and then from May 2004 until September 2004. The initial complaint of\ncondition was alcohol dependence and methamphetamine dependence.  \nApplicant testified that he began using drugs because of problems that he was having after\nhe left the military. He could not find decent employment, and when he tried to reenlist in the Coast\nGuard, he was turned down because he had Glaucoma. According to medical records, his history\nincluded 20 years of alcohol abuse and eight years of methamphetamine dependence (Exhibit 3). He\ntried to quit several times, but he was not able to quit, \u201cuntil he was ready.\u201d\nThe first time he left the in patient program early because he was attempting to reconcile with\nhis girlfriend, and because of other issues at the inpatient facility. He had not successfully overcome\nhis alcohol and drug addictions. When he entered the inpatient program on the second occasions on\nMay 2004, he was ready to quit.  According to his credible testimony, which has not been\ncontroverted, Applicant has not used any illegal substance or imbibed any alcoholic beverage since\nMay 2004. He left the program one or two weeks early because he had received a good employment\noffer, and he is still employed by that same company. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe committed three criminal acts. \n2.a. On January 31, 2004,  Applicant was arrested and charged with Battery. \n\n4\n2.b. On September 21, 2003 Applicant was arrested and charged with Annoying Phone Calls.\n2.c. On August 15, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with Inflicting Corporal Injury\non Spouse/Co-Habitant. He was found guilty and given 26 months probation, fined and ordered to\ncomplete 40 hours of community service. He violated his probation and was ordered to serve 180\ndays in jail beginning on September 29, 2005. \nApplicant testified that the arrest on January 2004,  listed above as 2.a., actually arose from\nthe 2002 incident, listed above as 2.c. As a result of his 2002 arrest for Corporal Injury of his\ngirlfriend, he was ordered to complete an anger management course. Because he failed to complete\nit, he ultimately was ordered to undergo four months of house arrest, which he did in 2005.\nAccording to Applicant this case was finally resolved to the courts satisfaction after he completed\nhis house arrest. \nIn both his RSOR and during his testimony, Applicant denied that he had been arrested for\nmaking Annoying Phone Calls, although he did concede that there was a period where he did call\nhis girlfriend frequently and ask her for help. \nThere is no evidence of any addition criminal acts by Applicant since his abstinence. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe engages in excessive alcohol consumption. \n3.a. Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1981 to at least 2004. \n3.b. The information that is alleged in subparagraph 1,b, above.\nAs stated above, Applicant testified credibly that he has not consumed any alcoholic beverage\nsince May 2004. No evidence has been introduced to dispute this contention. \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted three character letters, from his brother, a roommate and his former\nsupervisor (Exhibit A). All three acknowledged that Applicant had difficulties in his past, but that\nhe has turned his life around. He was described as \u201cdiligent and conscientious about his\nemployment\u201d and \u201ccapable of handling any situation with maturity.\u201d \nHe also submitted Honorable Discharge forms from both the United States Coast Guard and\nthe Army National Guard (Exhibit C). \nFinally, Applicant submitted two positive Performance Evaluations, one from the Coast\nGuard and the other from his private employment. He also enclosed two Letters of Commendation\nfrom the Coast Guard for excellent performance (Exhibit C).   \n\n5\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\n\n6\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper\nand illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and use of amphetamines, is of concern, especially\nin light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to\nhis illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) 25.\n(a) (any drug abuse), (c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution), and (f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program.\nBased on the fact that Applicant last used any illegal substance in May 2004, , I conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct comes within Mitigating Condition (MC) 26. (a) (the drug involvement\nhappened so long ago that it does not cast doubt about individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness\nand good judgement), and (b) also applies because of Applicant\u2019s demonstrated intention not to\ncontinue using drugs in the future.  \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nApplicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H. Applicant, on the other hand,\nhas introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to\novercome the Government's case against him.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 Guideline H of the SOR\nis concluded for Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nRegarding Guideline J, the Government has established Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct,\nApplicant\u2019s physical altercation with his girlfriend in 2002. Applicant's criminal conduct falls within\nCriminal Conduct DC 31. (a) a single serious crime. Based on all of the factors involved, I conclude\nthat MC 32. (d) applies, because there is sufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation including\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, and a good employment record.\nI find Paragraph 2 Guideline J of the SOR is concluded for Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)  \n\n7\nWith respect to Guideline G, the evidence establishes that Applicant consumed alcohol to\nexcess for many years. However, he was credible when he testified that he has not consumed any\nalcohol since May 2004, nor will he consume alcohol in the future. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline G,  I conclude that DC 22. (c) applies because\nApplicant has engaged in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment. MC 23. (b) applies because Applicant has acknowledged his alcoholism, and he has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence. I resolve Paragraph 3 Guideline G for Applicant.\nOn balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's information\nopposing his request for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nParagraph 2: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.: For Applicant\nParagraph 3: For APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.: For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nMartin H.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, a 38-year-old supply technician employed by a defense contractor, developed\nfinancial problems.  In April 2002 she lost her job.  Two months later she was in an automobile\naccident that totally incapacitated her cohabitant, the father of her two children.  She filed a Chapter\n7 bankruptcy petition in November 2002.  She obtained gainful employment in October 2004.  She\nfiled a Chapter 13 wage earner petition in 2006 to stop the foreclosure of her home.  In September\n2006, she received a personal injury settlement resulting from the accident.  All debt payments are\ncurrent.  She had minor alcohol-related incidents in 1995 and 2006.  She successfully mitigated the\nsecurity concerns about financial considerations and alcohol consumption.  Clearance is granted.\n\nItem 3 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated January 12, 2005).\n1\nId. at 1.\n2\nId. at 3, 5.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 12, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 10, 2006, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.\nPending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 3, 2006, and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of\nthe government\u2019s case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on March 14, 2007.  Applicant\nwas afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation by April 14, 2007.  She filed a response which was received by DOHA on April 12, 2007.\nThe case was assigned to me on July 26, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 38-year-old supply technician employed by a defense contractor.  She is\ndivorced and has two children.   She has no prior military service, and this is her first application for\n2\na security clearance.3\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant has two children, a daughter, age 9, and a son, age 5, that she is in raising on her\nown.  On April 5, 2002, she lost her job of 14 \u00bd years due to company downsizing.  On July 14,\n2002, she and the children\u2019s father were involved in an automobile accident that left him in a near\nvegetative state.  He cannot talk or walk and resides in a nursing home.  At the time of the accident,\nthe children were nine and one-half months and four.  Applicant was left with $10,000 in medical\nbills that her insurance did not cover, and she was also left without the second income that was used\n\nResponse to the FORM, dated April 2007, at 1.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s Answer, dated November 3, 2006, at 1-2.\n5\nItem 3, supra, note 1, at 5.\n6\nItem 7 (Docket Report, Bankruptcy Court, dated January 10, 2007) at 2-4.\n7\nItem 4 (Subject Interview, dated March 28, 2006) at 2.\n8\nId.\n9\nId.\n10\nId. at 1.\n11\n4\nto support the children.  Bankruptcy was the only option available at the time.  Following the\naccident, she spent every day with the children\u2019s father tried to rehabilitate him because he was not\ngetting medical rehabilitation.  She did this until January 2003, when she returned to school.  She\nenrolled in a local technical institute, to be a medical billing specialist.  She graduated with a 4.0\nGPA.  While she was in school, she received unemployment benefits.  She graduated in December\n2003, and continued to search for a job but was unable to get anything until March 2004.  She went\nto work for some doctors that she had interned for, but was paid nine dollars an hour, which was\ninsufficient to allow her to stay current with her bills.  She was hired by her current employer in\nOctober 2004.4\nIn 2002, Applicant filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.   Her delinquent debts\n5\ntotaled approximately $28,831.   These debts were originally discharged on April 10, 2003.  As a\n6\nresult of the car accident, Applicant received a settlement of $35,288.26.  Upon her motion, the\nChapter 7 bankruptcy case was reopened, and $10, 840.76 was paid to the trustee in bankruptcy.  She\nreceived $24,447.50 in September 2006.  The Chapter 7 case was closed on December 20, 2006.7\nIn March 2006, Applicant was about eight months behind on her mortgage payments. She\nfiled a voluntary petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on May 10, 2006.   Applicant\u2019s petition listed\n8\none creditor, a savings and loan home mortgage.  Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 plan was confirmed on\nOctober 5, 2006.  Applicant had paid the bankruptcy trustee $935.01, and was to pay $273.84 per\nmonth for 57 months starting in September 2006.  She owed about $11,964 in arrearage to the\nsavings and loan.   Applicant submitted a case report from the bankruptcy trustee that covered the\n9\nperiod May 10, 2006 to March 27, 2007.  That report shows monthly payments paid by Applicant\nand that her plan was current though the latter date.10\nAlcohol Consumption\nIn March 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with failed failure to stay in line and\ndriving under the influence of alcohol.  Her alcohol level was .07, under the legal limit.  She\nvoluntarily completed an alcohol education program.  The case was placed on the Stet docket and\nultimately dismissed.   On February 11, 2006, she was charged with public drunkenness.  She had\n11\nconsumed several beers and driven from a bar to a convenience store.  She fell asleep in the car and\n\nId.\n12\nId.\n13\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n14\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n5\nwas arrested by police.  She was fined $75 and paid $194.50 in court costs.   She stated that she\n12\ndoes not drink at home, rarely gets out to have a drink, does not keep alcoholic beverages in the\nhouse, and she\u2019s never had an alcohol-related problem with her employment.13\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n14\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\n\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s]\n15\nApplicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether\nApplicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July\n6, 2006).\n6\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).15\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nGuidelines \u00b618.  The Concern. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling\nis a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be\nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts\nGuidelines \u00b619.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nGuidelines \u00b6 20.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n\n7\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\nThe government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) Guidelines \u00b619 (a) (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC Guidelines \u00b619 (c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations) are applicable.  The\navailable information demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations\nfrom 2002 to 2006.  She filed bankruptcy in 2002 after losing her job, and after her children\u2019s father\nwas totally incapacitated in an automobile accident.  She was behind on her mortgage payments and\nfiled a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in 2006, pending receipt of her settlement.  The disqualifying\nconditions are applicable.\nOn the other hand, the conditions that led to these problems were largely beyond her control.\nApplicant lost her job, and the children\u2019s father, with whom she was cohabitating, was totally\nincapacitated in a 2002 automobile accident.  She was left without his income, $10,000 in medical\nbills not covered by insurance, and with two young children to raise.  This series of events was a\ntragic series of events that is not likely to recur.  When she finally received a settlement for her\ninjuries, she paid the chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee, and with the remainder, paid her delinquent debts,\nwith the exception of her mortgage arrearage, which she is paying through a Chapter 13 plan.  These\nevents were beyond her control, and she has acted responsibly, given the circumstances.  She has\nmade a good-faith effort to pay her bills and all evidence points to the fact that she now has her\nfinances under control and is current on all of her debts and bankruptcy plan payments.  Mitigating\nconditions Guidelines \u00b6 21 (a), (b), and (d) apply.  I conclude Guideline F for Applicant.\nAlcohol Consumption\nGuidelines \u00b6 21. The Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nGuidelines \u00b6 22. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\nGuidelines \u00b6 23. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n16\nId.\n17\nId.\n18\n8\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s 1995 alcohol incident was not  prosecuted, as her blood alcohol level was below\nthe minimum standard.  She voluntarily entered an alcohol education program.  In the 11 years until\nthe second alcohol incident in 2006, Applicant endured the hardships that were detailed in the\ndiscussion about financial considerations, supra.  I believe neither event casts doubt on her current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment..  She has never been found to be alcohol dependent\nor to suffer any disqualifying effects from alcohol.  She stated that she does not drink at home, rarely\ngets out to have a drink, does not keep alcoholic beverages in the house, and she has never had an\nalcohol-related problem with her employment.  Guidelines \u00b6 23 (a) applies and I conclude Guideline\nG for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n16\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\n17\nI also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests.   I considered her age (38), her unemployment, and what might\n18\ncause her to be in financial distress.  She availed herself of bankruptcy protection on two occasions.\nShe lost her job, then her cohabitant was incapacitated, causing loss of his income for the children.\nShe spent many months attempting to provide him with rehabilitation therapy.  She attended training\ncourses to improve her employability.  She started a lower-paying job in a medical practice before\nfinally get a good job with her current employer.  She has reached the point where all debts are\ncurrent, except for her mortgage arrearage, which she is paying through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy\ntrustee.  She has made a successful good-faith effort at resolving indebtedness. \n The alcohol incidents were years apart, are aberrant behavior, and do not cause me concern\nabout her trustworthiness or reliability.  What is important is that notwithstanding the crises in her\nlife, she has persevered and has her life under control.  Therefore, the totality of the record leads me\nto conclude that Applicant has the ability and the reliability to protect classified information, and can\nexercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government\nentrusts its interests.  I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant had seven delinquent debts totaling more than $12,000.  One debt for $878 was\nlegitimately disputed.  One debt for $420 was paid.  His federal tax refund of $2,380 was applied as\npartial payment on four delinquent student loans, leaving a balance of $7,877.  He intentionally\nfailed to disclose his delinquent debts on his security clearance application.  Security concerns based\non financial considerations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct are not mitigated.  Clearance is\ndenied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 5, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).  The\nSOR alleged security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), E (Personal\nConduct), and J (Criminal Conduct).  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 9, 2007 and elected to have the case\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s\nwritten case on March 9, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was\nprovided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to\nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on March\n19, 2007 and responded on April 3, 2007.  The case was assigned to me on April 18, 2007.  \nThe FORM reflected that Applicant received a copy of the Directive, but it did not reflect that\nhe received the Guidelines superseding Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, I ordered that\nApplicant be provided a copy of the Guidelines and given 30 days from date of receipt to file a\nsupplemental response.  A copy of the Guidelines was sent to Applicant on April 23, 2007, and\nreceived on April 26, 2007.  He did not file a supplemental response.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 24-year-old associate designer for a defense contractor, working at a naval\nshipyard.  After graduating from high school in June 2001, he attended a vocational school from\nSeptember 2001 to June 2002.  He has worked for his current employer since September 2004.  He\nwas married in March 2002, but is legally separated and living with his parents.  He has never held\na security clearance.\nOn February 6, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance, using an Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).  He answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 27b, asking if\nhe had wages garnished or property repossessed within the last seven years.  However, he answered\n\u201cno\u201d to question 28a, asking if he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt during the\nlast seven years.  He also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28b, asking if he was currently more than 90\ndays delinquent on any debts.  His credit report reflected three debts more than 180 days delinquent\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) and seven debts more than 90 days delinquent (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g).  The SOR alleges\nhe intentionally falsified his answers to questions 28a and 28b. \nApplicant admitted all the debts in his answer to the SOR.  He admitted the debt for computer\nequipment in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but his answers to DOHA interrogatories in October 2006 show that the\ndebt has been disputed since December 2003.  The documentation provided by Applicant in response\n\n4\nto DOHA interrogatories reflects that he was unhappy with a computer he had purchased, returned\nit in accordance with directions from the vendor, but continued to receive demands for payment.\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentary evidence that the debt alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 1.b was paid in full.  He also provided evidence that his federal tax refund of $2,380 was\napplied to his delinquent loans on February 9, 2007, leaving a balance due of about $7,877.  He\npromised to pay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c by April 1, 2007, but he has presented no evidence\nof payment.  \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement dated October 17, 2006, reflected net monthly\nincome of $1,426.70, expenses of $1,410, no debt payments, and a remainder of $16.70.  Child\nsupport payments are deducted from his pay and are reflected in the computation of his net monthly\nincome.\nApplicant denied falsifying his e-QIP, asserting he was unaware of the delinquent debts\nbecause he had not reviewed his credit report.  His credit report dated August 15, 2006, reflected that\nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were charged off as a bad debts in May 2003, and the debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was charged off in January 2005, almost a year before he executed his e-QIP.\nThe student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was referred for collection in March 2006, the month after he\nexecuted his e-QIP.  The student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g were all referred for\ncollection in May 2006.  All five student loans were at least 120 days past due when they were\nreferred for collection.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n19, 2002).  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed\nin the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\n\n5\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3; see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows:. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b618.\nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case.  Guidelines \u00b6 19(a) applies where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 19(c) applies when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d  These two disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR\nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 20(a).  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, frequent, and likely\nto recur because his obligations substantially exceed his income.  This mitigating condition is not\nestablished.\n\n6\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nApplicant presented no evidence of the circumstances giving rise to his financial situation. This\nmitigating condition is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 20(c).  This mitigating condition is not\nestablished because there is no evidence of counseling and the problem is not yet under control.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6\n20(d).  Applicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  He promised to pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c by April 1,\n2007, but has presented no proof of payment.  The partial payment of the student loans was an\ninvoluntary collection action, not a good faith effort by Applicant.  This mitigating condition is\nestablished only for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 20(e).  Applicant disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nHe presented documentary evidence showing that he returned the computer in accordance with the\nvendor\u2019s instructions but the vendor continued to bill him.  This mitigating condition is established\nfor the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 15.  The\nrelevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 16(a).\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the\nomission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind\nat the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n\n7\nApplicant claimed he was unaware of the seven debts omitted from his e-QIP.  His\naffirmative answer to question 27b on the e-QIP, pertaining to garnishments or foreclosures, appears\nto refer to the collection of child support from his pay.  He knew about the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a,\nbecause he had been negotiating with the vendor to resolve it since December 2003.  He knew he\nhad student loans, but he claimed he was unaware that they were delinquent, even though he had\nmade no payments for at least 120 days.  His claimed ignorance is neither plausible nor credible.\nI conclude the disqualifying condition in Guidelines \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to\nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance application\nmay be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 17(a).\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to correct his omissions were neither prompt nor in good faith.  He executed the\ne-QIP in February 2006 but did not admit or explain the debts until confronted with DOHA\ninterrogatories in October 2006.  This mitigating condition is not established, and no other\nenumerating mitigating conditions are applicable.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 30.  Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 31(a).\nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both, to\nknowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the\nUnited States.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  Security clearances are matters within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive branch of the government of the United States.  A deliberately false answer on a security\nclearance application is a serious crime within the meaning of Guideline J.  Applicant\u2019s false\nanswers on his e-QIP raise the disqualifying condition in Guidelines \u00b6 31(a), shifting the burden to\nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 32(a).  This mitigating condition is not established, because Applicant\u2019s\nfalsification was recent, did not happen under unusual circumstances, and casts doubt on his\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record,\nor constructive community involvement.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 32(d).  This mitigating condition is not\nestablished, because Applicant\u2019s falsification was recent, he has shown no remorse, and there is no\nevidence anything in his life has changed.\n\n8\nThe Whole Person\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines\n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant\u2019s falsification was serious misconduct.  Because he is financially overextended,\nhe is vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  His financial neglect and falsifications\nraise questions about his level of maturity.  Unless he changes his behavior, his financial problems\nare likely to recur.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, E, and J, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concerns based on financial considerations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.\nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2.

Applicant began using marijuana, which she knew to be illegal, when she was 14. She used marijuana approximately 50 times during high school and college. Her heaviest use of marijuana occurred in high school, when she sometimes used it twice a week. At other times, months would pass from one use to the next. In college, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana would follow a similar pattern. Sometimes she used the drug for two weekends in a row, and at other times several months would pass between uses. Applicant purchased marijuana twice in high school and once in college. She used marijuana for approximately three years after graduating from college. She has witnessed others in her social circle using marijuana within the last 6 to 12 months, and she has a close companion who uses marijuana. In her security clearance application (SF-86) executed on November 3, 2004, Applicant admitted using marijuana 50 times between October 1997 and July 2004, pointing out that most of her usage took place when she was in high school and college.

Facts\nThe Administrative Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:\nApplicant is 26 years old, and for the past two years has been employed as a financial analyst\nby a government contractor.  She was awarded a bachelor of arts degree in May 2002, and her\nacademic transcripts indicated that she earned mostly Bs and As.  Applicant began using marijuana,\nwhich she knew to be illegal, when she was 14.  She used marijuana approximately 50 times during\nhigh school and college.  Her heaviest use of marijuana occurred in high school, when she sometimes\nused it twice a week.  At other times, months would pass from one use to the next.  In college,\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana would follow a similar pattern.  Sometimes she used the drug for two\nweekends in a row, and at other times several months would pass between uses.  Applicant\npurchased marijuana twice in high school and once in college.  She used marijuana for\napproximately three years after graduating from college.  She has witnessed others in her social circle\nusing marijuana within the last 6 to 12 months, and she has a close companion who uses marijuana.\nIn her security clearance application (SF-86) executed on November 3, 2004, Applicant\nadmitted using marijuana 50 times between October 1997 and July 2004, pointing out that most of\nher usage took place when she was in high school and college.  In September 2005, Applicant was\ninterviewed by an authorized investigator of the Department of Defense and she admitted using\nmarijuana on three occasions after completing her SF-86, with a last use in February 2005.  When\nasked by the investigator whether she would use marijuana again, she said that she could not predict\nthe future but could not foresee herself using it again.  At the hearing, the Applicant  stated that she\nwas nervous when questioned by the investigator and did not come across as emphatically as she had\nhoped to, but that she had no intention in September 2005 or at the hearing of ever using marijuana\nagain. \nOn October 17, 2006, Applicant met with a clinical psychologist for substance abuse\nevaluation.  He evaluated her and issued a report (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  The report included\nApplicant\u2019s statement to the psychologist that \u201cshe has not smoked any marijuana in several years\n\n3\nand the last time she smoked \u2018it seemed stupid and I wanted to grow up.\u2019\u201d Based on his assessment\nof Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and a negative drug test, the psychologist concluded that Applicant\n\u201cdoes not have an ongoing substance abuse problem.\u201d  He made no recommendations for substance\nabuse education or treatment.   At her hearing, Applicant stated that the psychologist was inaccurate\nwhen he reported that she told him that she had not smoked marijuana in several years.  Nothing in\nthe record indicated Applicant had brought the alleged inaccuracy to the attention of the psychologist\nor had asked him to correct his report or, if necessary, revise his evaluation. \nApplicant does not believe that her marijuana use affected her academic performance, her\njudgment, or job performance.  She participates in a community service program to mentor\nunderprivileged high school students; her supervisor praised her professionalism and judgment; and\nher job appraisals indicated that she exceeded standards in many areas.  \nB. Discussion \nApplicant does not dispute the Judge\u2019s findings as such.  But, as indicated hereafter,\nApplicant does dispute the Judge\u2019s interpretation of some of the findings, the weight the Judge\nplaced on some of them, or the conclusions that the Judge drew from them.  Applicant believes that\nthe Judge erred in not discussing some favorable evidence, and offers some rebuttal evidence for the\nBoard\u2019s consideration.  \nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.31.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620\n(1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  \nApplicant disputes the weight and negative inferences that the Judge placed on the portion\nof the psychologist\u2019s report which stated that Applicant had told the psychologist in October 2006\nthat she \u201chad not smoked any marijuana in several years.\u201d Applicant denies that she reported to the\npsychologist that she had not smoked marijuana for several years.  She argues on appeal that she\nvoluntarily brought this inconsistency to the Judge\u2019s attention.  Applicant indicates that she thought\nthat she had a moral responsibility to do so.  She argues that she was prepared to explain why she\nhad not gotten the psychologist to address the discrepancy, but that neither the Department Counsel\nnor Judge pursued this issue.  \nThe Judge could have concluded that pointing out such a discrepancy within one\u2019s own\nexhibit before cross-examination is favorable to Applicant, and as Applicant indicated, she had a\nmoral duty to do so.  Applicant also had a legal duty to do so because she knew that a portion of her\nown exhibit was incorrect.  However, Applicant\u2019s initiative did not require the Judge, as a matter of\nlaw, to draw an inference on this issue in Applicant\u2019s favor.  Moreover, neither the Department\nCounsel nor the Judge were required to ask follow-up questions about the discrepancy and why\nApplicant had not pursued efforts to get the psychologist to correct the error and reconsider his\n\n4\nconclusions if necessary.  The burden of explanation was on the Applicant, not the Department\nCounsel.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant had introduced this issue in her direct examination, and\nthat would have been a proper place to offer further explanation.  The Judge, as an impartial trier of\nfact, has the discretion but is not required to conduct an examination of any witness.  The statement\nin Applicant\u2019s appeal brief that she did not approach the psychologist about clarifying the\ndiscrepancy in his report, and modify any recommendation if necessary, because she had inadequate\ntime to prepare after her attorney\u2019s withdrawal, is not persuasive.  At the beginning of the hearing,\nApplicant, who was then represented by a personal representative, was invited to address the\nconsequences of her attorney\u2019s late withdrawal, but she chose not to request a continuance on that\nbasis.  Applicant admitted that she had adequate notice and time to prepare.  Tr. at 9-10.  Under those\ncircumstances, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s failure to call the psychologist\nas a witness, or otherwise request him to clarify this discrepancy and modify his conclusions if\nnecessary, \u201ccast doubt on the reliability of the report and raised concerns about [Applicant\u2019s]\ncredibility.\u201d Decision at 6. \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred by not discussing favorable record evidence.  Examples\nof this include a letter from the corporate vice president of her employer who has no hesitation in\nrecommending Applicant for a position of trust notwithstanding her prior indiscretions (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit C).   Moreover, while the Judge mentioned Applicant\u2019s community service role as a mentor\nfor underprivileged high school students, Applicant argues that the Judge erred by not addressing\nher intention to continue with the program and the time and dedication that she invested in it\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge has considered all record evidence unless\nthe Judge specifically states otherwise.  Furthermore, the Judge was not required to discuss each and\nevery piece of evidence in her decision.  See ISCR Case No. 03-07412 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2007).\nThe corporate vice president\u2019s letter and evaluation as supervisor, along with prior evaluations by\nother supervisors, are all part of Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and the Judge cited this exhibit in her\ndecision.  Decision at 4.  The Judge\u2019s decision specifically cited Applicant\u2019s testimony (Tr. at 44-47)\nin which Applicant described her time and dedication to the mentor program and her commitment\nto the program for another year.  Decision at 4.  Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge failed to\nconsider this favorable evidence is not persuasive.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nThere is a presumption against granting a clearance.  Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399,\n1401 (9 Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government presents evidence\n\n\u201cThe drug involvement was not recent\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.1). \n2\n\u201cA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.3). \n3\n\u201cThe drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.2). \n4\n5\nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating\nconditions.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nApplicant contends that Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions 1  and 3  applied to her\n2\n3\ncircumstances, and that as a matter of law, based on record evidence, the Administrative Judge was\ncompelled to make formal findings in her favor.  While the Judge agreed that Applicant\u2019s drug\ninvolvement was not recent, she found that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, although sometimes sporadic\nand intermittent, was continual and spanned approximately eight years of her adolescence and young\nadulthood.  Decision at 5-6.  Thus, the Judge concluded that Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition\n2  did not apply because Applicant\u2019s \u201cdrug involvement was neither isolated nor aberrational and\n4\nrepresented a consistent and long-standing lifestyle choice.\u201d Decision at 6.  The Judge then\nconsidered Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3 and found that Applicant had no plan or\nrationale for abstaining from marijuana, and that she continues to associate with people who use it.\nIn that regard, the Judge\u2019s analysis highlighted the absence of a track record demonstrating\nabstinence.  Decision at 6.  Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision not to apply Mitigation\nCondition 3 was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because: in her testimony she provided the\nJudge her rationale for abstaining from future use; her hearing testimony about use of marijuana in\nher social circle shows that she has \u201cnot witnessed anybody use marijuana in quite a long time;\u201d she\nhas not used marijuana since February 2005; and the psychologist concluded that she did not have\nan ongoing substance abuse problem.      \nThe Judge\u2019s conclusions that Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3 did not apply and\nthat security concerns under Guideline H could not be mitigated, are sustainable.  Considering\nApplicant\u2019s long-standing use of marijuana, the Judge had reasonable concerns about whether\nApplicant\u2019s social circle would support her abstinence.  The Judge plausibly interpreted Applicant\u2019s\nhearing testimony to be that she continues to associate with people who use marijuana.  For example,\nregarding marijuana use by her \u201cgood friends\u201d at the time of the hearing, Applicant testified that \u201cI\nmay know a few people that still will casually use it, yes.\u201d Tr. at 51.  And while Applicant claims\nthat she had not witnessed anybody use marijuana \u201cin quite a long time,\u201d she also testified that\npeople who she socializes with used marijuana in front of her within the past two years.  Tr. at 58-59.\nThe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had not provided sufficient evidence to resolve the\ndiscrepancy in the psychologists\u2019s report is sustainable, and the Judge reasonably questioned whether\nthe discrepancy impeached a psychologist\u2019s evaluation that was facially predicated, in part, on\nApplicant having not smoked marijuana for several years.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence\n\n\u201cThe individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion,\n5\nexploitation, or duress\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.5).  \n\u201cAssociation with persons involved in criminal activities has ceased\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.7). \n6\n6\nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 03-07412 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2007).  \n \nApplicant claims that the security concerns under Guideline E must be mitigated under\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Conduct 5.   However, for the reasons explained in the previous\n5\nparagraph, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Mitigating Condition did not apply is sustainable.  There is\nplausible evidence that Applicant\u2019s still associates with persons who use marijuana socially.  Such\nactivity also supported the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 7  did not\n6\napply. \nFinally, the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is sustainable.  Viewed in its most positive light,\nall of Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, including her exemplary job performance and valuable\ncommunity service, did not compel the Judge to conclude that such evidence outweighed the security\nconcerns.   Evidence of an applicant\u2019s value to her employer or community is not the issue here; the\nissue is Applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 04-11893 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 25,\n2006).  The Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in\npersons granted access to classified information.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6\n(1980).  Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather are predictive judgments\nabout a person\u2019s security suitability in light of that person\u2019s past conduct and present circumstances.\nSee Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  An applicant with good or\nexemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security implications.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  A whole person analysis, by its very\nlanguage, is not confined to the workplace.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun.\n4, 2004).   Here the Judge explicitly considered the whole person factors described in Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.  While considering favorable record evidence for Applicant, the Judge also considered such\nunfavorable evidence as Applicant\u2019s continued association with persons who still use marijuana,\nApplicant\u2019s  knowledge even as a adolescent that marijuana use was illegal, and Applicant\u2019s use of\nmarijuana after she completed her SF-86.  The Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole\nand consider whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-13768 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, 2005).  In this case, the Judge reasonably\nconcluded that the weight of the unfavorable evidence was such that it was not clearly consistent\nwith the national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n\n7\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael D. Hipple           \nMichael D.

Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guidelines\nH and E.  Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On August 29, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and Department\n1\nof Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 15, 2006, and elected\nto have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on October 11, 2006.\nOn December 11, 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. At the hearing, the\nGovernment offered two exhibits, which were identified as Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2 and entered  in the\nrecord without objections.  Applicant testified on her own behalf and offered six  exhibits, identified\nas Ex. A through F, for admission to the record.  Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record\nwithout objections.  At the conclusion of the evidence, I left the record open so that Applicant could\nprovide a missing page from her Ex. C.

In May 2002, she was awarded a bachelor of arts degree with a\nmajor in psychology from a U.S. university. Her academic transcripts indicated she earned mostly Bs\nand As in her college studies.  (Ex. 1; Ex. B.)\n\n3\nApplicant began using marijuana, which she knew was illegal, when she was 14 years old.  She\nused marijuana approximately 50 times during her high school and college years.  Applicant\u2019s heaviest\nuse of marijuana occurred in high school, when she would sometimes use marijuana twice a week.\nAt other times, months might pass between one use and another.  As a college student, Applicant\u2019s use\nof marijuana followed a similar pattern.  Sometimes she used the drug for two weekends in a row, and\nat other times she might not use it for several months.  Applicant purchased marijuana twice in high\nschool and once in college.  She used marijuana for approximately three years after graduating from\ncollege.  She has witnessed others in her social circle using marijuana within the last 6 to 12 months.\nApplicant has a close companion who uses marijuana.  (Ex. 2; Tr. 30-31, 48, 51, 56, 58-59.)\nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) on November 3, 2004.  In\nresponse to Question 27 on the SF-86, she admitted using marijuana 50 times between approximately\nOctober 1997 and July 2004.  (Ex. 1, Ex. 2.)  Under the general remarks section of the SF-86,\nApplicant asserted she did not wish to excuse her use of marijuana, but she pointed out that most of\nher usage took place when she was in high school and college. (Ex. 2 at 7.)\nIn September 2005, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator of the Department\nof Defense.  The investigator asked her if she had used marijuana since completing her SF-86.  She\nadmitted using marijuana on three different occasions after executing and signing her SF-86.  She told\nthe investigator her last use of marijuana was in February 2005.  When the investigator asked her if\nshe would use marijuana in the future, she said she could not predict the future but could not foresee\nherself using marijuana in the future.  At her hearing, Applicant stated she was nervous when\nquestioned by the investigator.  She said her intention never to use marijuana again did not come\nacross as emphatically as she had hoped it would.  She said she had no intention in September 2005\nto use marijuana again when she was questioned by the investigator, and she had no present intention\nto ever use marijuana again.  (Tr. 34-37, 47.) \nOn October 17, 2006, Applicant met with a clinical psychologist for a substance abuse\nevaluation.  The clinical psychologist interviewed and evaluated Applicant.  He issued a report, which\nincluded the following paragraph:\nShe reported to me that she began to smoke marijuana at the age of 14.\nShe reported that she was caught with marijuana at summer camp and\nwas grounded by her parents.  She then stopped smoking for 18 months\nbecause she was involved with cheerleading and the debate team in\nhigh school and \u201cI didn\u2019t care for the people who were using it and it\nmakes you lazy.\u201d  After that time, she reported that she used it \u201conce\nevery couple of months\u201d during high school and occasionally during\ncollege.  She reported that she has not smoked any marijuana in several\nyears and the last time she smoked \u201cit seemed stupid and I wanted to\ngrow up.\u201d [Applicant] reports that she graduated from college with a\n3.75 GPA [Grade Point Average] and she subsequently attended law\nschool for a year.  She was polite and cooperative during the interview\nand responded openly to all questions.  (Ex. D at 1.)\nBased on his assessment of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and a negative drug test, the clinical\npsychologist concluded Applicant \u201cdoes not have an ongoing substance abuse problem\u201d and he made\n\n4\nno recommendations for substance abuse education or treatment.  (Ex. D at 1.)  At her hearing,\nApplicant stated the clinical psychologist was inaccurate when he reported she told him she had not\nsmoked any marijuana in several years.  (Tr. 43.)  Nothing in the record indicated Applicant had\nbrought the alleged inaccuracy to the attention of the clinical psychologist or had asked him to correct\nhis report or, if necessary, revise his evaluation. \nApplicant did not believe her marijuana use affected her academic performance, her judgment,\nor her job performance. (Tr. 31.)  She attributed her marijuana use to immaturity and irresponsibility.\n(Tr. 36, 56.)  For the past 13 months, Applicant has participated in a community service program as\na volunteer mentor and role model for an underprivileged high school student.  (Ex. F; Tr. 44-47.)\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor praised her professionalism and trustworthiness.  Her performance appraisals\nfor 2005 and 2006 indicated she exceeded her performance standards in many areas.  (Ex. C.)  \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20,\n1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-20700 at 3.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nSection 986(c)(2) of Title 10, United States Code, provides that the Department of Defense\nmay not grant or renew a security clearance for an employee of a contractor of the Department of\nDefense if the employee is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance as defined in\nsection 102 of the Controlled Substances Act.  (21 U.S.C. 802)  The allegations in this case require\nthat a determination be made regarding the applicability of Section 986(c)(2).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\n\nDC E2.A8.1.2.1 reads, in pertinent part: \u201cAny drug abuse.\u201d  DC E2.A8.1.2.2. reads: \u201cIllegal drug possession,\n3\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, and distribution.\u201d\n5\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying\nfrequency from about 1997 to at least February 2005 (\u00b6 1.a.); that she used marijuana after executing\na security clearance application on November 3, 2004(\u00b6 1.b.); that she could not say she would not use\nmarijuana in the future (\u00b6 1.c.); that she purchased marijuana  (\u00b6 1.d.); and that  the facts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a. and 1.c. disqualify Applicant under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 from having a security clearance granted or\nrenewed by the Department of Defense (\u00b6 1.e.)\nThe Government\u2019s concern with Guideline H conduct is that it raises questions regarding an\nindividual\u2019s ability or willingness to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may\nimpair social or occupational functioning, thereby increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure\nof classified information.  \u00b6 E2.A8.1.1.1.\nDrugs are defined under Guideline H as mood and behavior-altering substances, including\ndrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act\nof 1970, as amended, and inhalants and other similar substances. \u00b6\u00b6 E2.A8.1.1.2., E2.A8.1.1.2.1.,\nE2.A8.1.1.2.2.  Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates\nfrom approved medical direction.  \u00b6 E2.A8.1.1.3.  Marijuana, or cannabis, is identified and listed in\nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, as a controlled substance.  \nFrom Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government has established a prima facie case that she\npurchased and used marijuana intermittently but habitually for over eight years between 1997 and at\nleast February 2005, and that she used marijuana after executing a security clearance application in\nNovember 2004.  Applicant has admitted Guideline H drug involvement specified in the SOR and\nidentified as disqualifying under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. and DC E2.A8.1.2.2.3\nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana began when she was 14 years\nold and continued through her high school, college, and post-college years.  By her own estimate,\nApplicant used marijuana approximately 50 times in high school and college. She used marijuana three\ntimes after completing her security clearance application in November 2004. \n\nMC E2.A8.1.3.1. reads: \u201cThe drug involvement was not recent.\u201d  \n4\nMC E2.A8.1.3.2. reads: \u201cThe drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event.\u2019\n5\nMC E2.A8.1.3.3. reads: \u201cA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\u201d\n6\n6\nApplicant stated her last drug use occurred in February 2005, almost two years ago.  Thus, her\ndrug involvement was not recent, and, accordingly, Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A8.1.3.1.  applies.\n4\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, although sometimes sporadic and intermittent, was continual and\nspanned a period of approximately eight years of her adolescence and young adulthood.  Thus, her drug\ninvolvement was neither isolated nor aberrational and represented a consistent and long-standing\nlifestyle choice.  Therefore, MC E2.A8.1.3.2.  does not apply.\n5\nApplicant asserted several times at her hearing that she did not intend to use marijuana in the\nfuture.  While this assertion appeared credible, Applicant provided no plan or rationale for abstaining\nfrom the use of marijuana and she continues to associate with people who use marijuana.  Absent some\nclear demonstration of how she planned to abstain from marijuana use, and a measurable track record\nshowing abstinence, Applicant failed to show that MC E2.A8.1.3.3.  is applicable.\n6\nAccording to her testimony, Applicant is not presently using marijuana and has not used\nmarijuana since February 2005.  An assessment by a clinical psychologist concluded she is not\naddicted to marijuana and does not require treatment or substance abuse education.  Accordingly, she\nis neither at present an unlawful user nor addicted to a controlled substance as defined by section 102\nof the Controlled Substances Act, and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) is inapplicable.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct,\nwhen she used marijuana after executing a security clearance application in November 2004 and while\nknowing that the use of marijuana could affect her employment and clearance (\u00b6 2.a.).  DOHA also\nalleged Applicant, who was by then a college graduate, also used marijuana after remarking on her SF-\n86 that she did not wish to excuse her use of marijuana but wished to point out that most of her use\noccurred in her high school and college days (\u00b6 2.b.).  Guideline E conduct, which involves\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1.\nWith respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established\nits case.  The Government established, and Applicant admitted, that she used marijuana three times\nafter executing her security clearance application.  Knowing she was still using marijuana, Applicant\nasserted on her security clearance application that the majority of her usage occurred while in high\nschool and college.  At her hearing, Applicant stated she did not believe her use of marijuana affected\nher academic performance, her judgment, or her job performance, suggesting she was unaware of or\nignored the fact that illegal involvement with drugs raises legitimate questions about an individual\u2019s\nwillingness or ability to obey the law and to protect classified information.\n\nMC E2.A5.1.3.5. reads: \u201cThe individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate\n7\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  MC E2.A5.1.3.7. reads: \u201cAssociation with persons involved in\ncriminal activities has ceased.\u201d\n7\nAdditionally, at her hearing, Applicant stated the clinical psychologist\u2019s report of his interview\nwith her was inaccurate, and she denied telling him she had not used marijuana for several years.\nHowever, Applicant provided no evidence to resolve this discrepancy, which cast doubt on the\nreliability of the report and raised concerns about her credibility.  The clinical psychologist was not\ncalled as a witness to discuss his interview with Applicant.  Applicant\u2019s conduct raises concerns under\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of rule violation.  Her\nwillingness to break rules and violate laws in her marijuana use suggests that, under some\ncircumstances, she may put her interests before those of the Government.\nAs a young professional, Applicant continues to associate with individuals who use marijuana\nsocially, thus exposing herself to the possibility of coercion, exploitation, or duress and ignoring the\nreality that illegal drug use is criminal behavior.  Thus Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A5.1.3.5. and\nMC E2.A5.1.3.7.  are inapplicable.  No other Guideline E mitigating conditions apply.\n7\nWhole Person Analysis\nParagraph E2.2 of the Directive requires that the adjudicative process in a security clearance\ncase not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered\nin a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct (E2.2.1.1); the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation (E2.2.1.2); the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct (E2.2.1.3); the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct (E2.2.1.4.); the voluntariness of participation (E2.2.1.5.); the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes (E2.2.1.6); the motivation for the conduct\n(E2.2.1.7); the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (E2.2.1.8.); and, the likelihood\nfor continuation or recurrence (E2.2.1.9).\nApplicant voluntarily admitted her marijuana use in adolescence and college and after\ncompleting her security clearance application.  It is unclear how forthcoming she was with the clinical\npsychologist who assessed her drug use and recounted it in his report.  \nApplicant is now 26 years old, a college graduate, and employed in a professional position with\na defense contractor.  For the last 13 months, she has served as a mentor and role model for an\nunderprivileged high school student.  She testified she has been aware since adolescence that\nmarijuana use is illegal.  Even so, she continued her use of marijuana throughout high school and\ncollege.  She used marijuana after college, and she used marijuana while she knew she was under\ninvestigation for a security clearance.\nApplicant attempted to minimize her illegal conduct by asserting her use of marijuana did not\naffect her judgment, academic record, or job performance.  She testified she had not used marijuana\nsince February 2005 and had no intention to use illegal drugs in the future.  The report of the clinical\npsychologist tended to support her claims of abstinence.  However, Applicant had no plan in place to\nensure that she followed through on her intention.  Additionally, she continues to associate with\n\n8\nindividuals who use illegal drugs, thus raising a concern she may be vulnerable to coercive efforts by\nothers to cause her to use illegal drugs again.  \nI have reviewed and considered all of the evidence, and I have assessed Applicant\u2019s credibility\nand demeanor.  After weighing the applicable Guideline H and E disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, and after considering all relevant factors in the whole person analysis, I conclude Guideline\nH allegations 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d. against Applicant, and Guideline H allegations 1.c and 1.e. for the\nApplicant.  I conclude Guideline E allegations 2.a. and 2.b. against Applicant.  \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security\nclearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past\ntransgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common\nsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed,\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and\nomissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude Applicant\nshould not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the\nevidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of Defense\nDirective, 5220.6., as amended\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline H.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.\nGuideline E.: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2. a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on November 27, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security\nconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nof the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.\nDoD implemented them effective September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is issued on or after September\n1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this case\nproceed under the new guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 11, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February 1, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on February 16, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 1, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.  The government offered ten exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-10.  Applicant offered four\nexhibits, marked as exhibits A-D.  I kept the record open until March 20, 2007, and without\nobjection, extended it to March 30, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional documents.\nHe filed no documents.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 12, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.i.,\n1.k., and 1.n.  He denied all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon\ndue consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 41-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor.   He was\n2\ndivorced in 2001, and has four children   He is a high school graduate   He served in the United\n3\n4\nStates Army Reserve from 1984 to 2004.  He served in Kosova, and left active duty with the rank\nof sergeant  (E-4).

He filed his first chapter 13\nbankruptcy petition in May 2002.  The court dismissed his case in July 2002, because he had been\ndeployed to Kosova, and under the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act, he could defer payments during\nhis deployment.  When he returned in 2004, and upon his release from active duty, the mortgagor\nattempted to foreclose on his house.   He filed two Chapter 13 petitions in July and September 2004,\n8\nin an effort to stall the foreclosure, as he had the house listed for sale.  In September 2004, he sold\n\nId. at 30.\n9\nId. at 79-81.\n10\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D (Credit Report, dated September 26, 2006) at 1-9.\n11\nGovernment Exhibit 10 (Credit Report, dated March 1, 2007) at 1-2.\n12\nId.\n13\nId. at 51-52.\n14\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra, note 1, at 8.\n15\nId. at 47-49.\n16\n5\nthe house.   The closing agent used the sale proceeds to pay some of his debts.   Applicant was asked\n9\nto provide the government with a copy of the closing agreement, which he said was in storage.  He\ndid not do so.  \n10\nIn comparing the credit report of September 26, 2006,  and the credit report dated March 1,\n11\n2007,  remaining unpaid are those debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.i., 1.k., 1.n., and 1.p.  The\n12\nfirst involves a state tax deficiency, the second concerns a repossession for which he owes\napproximately $15,000, the third is a note in default which he co-signed, with a balance due of about\n$24,500, and the fourth is $365, to replace a bad check he gave an to an automobile dealer.13\nApplicant stated he had made arrangements to pay the two large debts, a debt consolidation plan, to\npay $621 per month.  He was asked to provide the government a copy of the agreement but did not\ndo so.14\nPersonal Conduct\nWhen Applicant executed his questionnaire for national security positions (Standard Form\n86), on July 8, 2004, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201cQuestion 33.  Your Financial\nRecord - Bankruptcy In the last 7 years, have you filed a petition under any chapter of the\nbankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?\u201d  He also answered \u201cNo\u201d on the same SF 86, when he\nanswered the following question: \u201c37.  Your Financial Record - Unpaid Judgments  In the last\n7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?  On that same SF 86, he\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to \u201cQuestion 38.  Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 days  In the last\n7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d   He failed to list information\n15\nabout his delinquent debts and bankruptcy filings as detailed in SOR subparagraph 1, and as\ndiscussed in the previous section.\nApplicant thought he had answered the questions correctly.  He believed that because he\navailed himself of the benefits of the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act, he didn\u2019t know that he should\nlist these debts on the SF 86.  He asked no questions about the form or about the questions on it.  He\nstated that he didn\u2019t recall what he answered.  \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to put \u201cno\u201d on there when I answered\nthem, and I told him that.  If I put no, that was a mistake on my part.\u201d16\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n17\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n18\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n19\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n6\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each Guidelines, the Guidelines are\ndivided into Disqualifying Conditions and Mitigating Conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.  Guidelines \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.17\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n18\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n19\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n20\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n21\n7\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.20\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the Guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n21\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nGuidelines \u00b6 18. The Concern. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nGuidelines \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts since at least 1999.  He adequately explained that\nthe Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions were used to stop the foreclosure of his home until he could get\nit sold.  He has made progress on either paying debts or getting the credit reporting agencies to\n\n8\nremove other debts that were not his.  However, he still owes about $40,000.  He did not provide a\ncopy of his consolidation agreement to substantiate his efforts to pay down these debts.\nGuidelines \u00b620. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\nApplicant\u2019s debts are continuing.  While he was deployed, payments he made to his wife to\npay bills were instead used by her to build her own home.  They divorced after he returned from that\ndeployment.  While the divorce itself did not create any unusual financial problem for him, the\ndeployment did because his wife did not pay his bills. There is no evidence that he sought\ncounseling.  He did initiate a good-faith effort to pay his bills, as evidenced by the bankruptcy\npetition, and payment of some debts from his house sale.  What is troubling is the $40,000 still\nunpaid.  His lack of documentation showing any effort to arrange terms with creditors, after telling\nthe government he would provide it, and after being given nearly a month after the hearing to do so,\nis problematic.  It casts doubt about the veracity of his testimony.  I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nGuidelines \u00b6 15. The Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuidelines \u00b616. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App.\n22\nBd. Jun 9, 2004).\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n23\nId.\n24\nId.\n25\n9\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nGuidelines \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising\nor instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and\ntruthfully.\nApplicant denies that he deliberately falsified his answers to the questions on his SF 86,\narguing that because he availed himself of the benefits of the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act, he\ndidn\u2019t know that he should list these debts on the SF 86.  When a falsification allegation is\ncontroverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone,\ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred.  An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is\ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the\nomission occurred.   The government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment, or\n22\nfalsification in his answers was deliberate.  Applicant thought he had answered the questions\ncorrectly, yet he asked no questions about the form or about the questions on it.  He stated that he\ndidn\u2019t recall what he answered.  Applicant has held a security clearance for over 20 years, he has\nnearly 20 years service in the Army Reserve, and he has a history of bad debt.  I do not believe his\nexplanations.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n23\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n24\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (48),\n25\nhis education, his employment, his military service, and what might motivate him to be less than\ntruthful.  Applicant supplied false answers on a security clearance application.  This is problematic\n\n10\nbecause candor with the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness\ndetermination.  If a person discloses their personal adverse information, then he or she is more likely\nto be trustworthy with confidential or classified information.  The totality of the record  raises\nreasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information and to\nexercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government\nentrusts its interests and secrets.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant incurred approximately $18,570 in delinquent debt, including many charged off\ncollection accounts.  Applicant owes approximately $6,000 for tax year 2003 to the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS). She provided no information concerning a structured plan to pay her creditors, and\nthus failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant's eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted eight items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 5 (Applicant\u2019s admission in Interrogatories).\n3\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn January 11, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on August 1, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant\nmaterial (FORM) on August 7, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.   Applicant did not submit any\n2\nadditional information. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2007. \nRULING ON PROCEDURE\nOn July 31, 2007, the government moved to amend the SOR by deleting and replacing the\nexisting allegation 1.d to conform to the record evidence, and adding the following allegation to the\nSOR as 1.f.\n1.d     You are indebted to Appl CD Bk/ Pinnacle Financial Group in the approximate amount\nof $2,730, for a delinquent account referred for collection by Cross Country in about July 2004. As\nof April 27, 2007, this debt has not been paid.\n1.f     You are indebted to the Internal Revenue Service in the approximate amount of $6,000\nfor the tax year 2003. As of October 20, 2006, this debt has not been paid.3\nThe Applicant did not object to the motion. I granted the government\u2019s motion to amend the\nSOR.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted  allegations in subparagraphs  1.a through 1.e in her SOR response under\nGuideline F.

She required chemotherapy and due to\nthe side effects was ordered by her physician to remain home and out of work. Applicant states she\nwas out of work for almost one year. During that year she worked approximately six weeks.6\nApplicant\u2019s debts in the SOR total approximately $18,570.    Multiple accounts were charged\n7\noff or placed for collection. Several of the debts have been in collection since 2002.  \n8\nApplicant provided some details about her financial status in her February 2006 investigative\ninterview.  She acknowledges that her credit is poor and that she has an inability to pay all her bills.\nShe wants to pay her debts, but has not developed a plan to resolve them. However, she stated that\nshe did contact the creditors and will get back to them to make arrangements to pay her bills. During\nthat interview, she noted that she owes $6,000 in taxes from 2003 to the IRS.9\nApplicant and her husband earn $3,395 in monthly net income.

She is not making any monthly payments to any creditors\nlisted in the SOR.10\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n11\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n12\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n13\n Id.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n18\n4\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n12\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n13\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n14\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.15\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n16\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n17\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n18\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n19\nISCR Case No. 99-0012 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)(citation omitted).\n20\n5\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.19\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of $18,570. She admits they are still outstanding debts. Her\n2007 credit report and answers to her interrogatories confirm all her alleged debts. Consequently,\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply because\nApplicant still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt. One collection account is from 2002.\nDespite steady employment, these numerous debts are delinquent. She provided no explanation of\nspecial circumstances that would apply.\nShe has been in her current position since 2002. She has not provided sufficient evidence or\nexplanation to support the FC MC AG \u00b620(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances).\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions. FC MC AG\u00b620(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem/and or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or under control); FC MC AG \u00b6 20 (d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts);FC MC AG \u00b620(e) (the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue) \nApplicant has not received financial counseling or developed a structured plan to resolve these\ndebts. Applicant's financial problems remain. It is unlikely they will be resolved in the near future.\nApplicant has not shown that she established a record of steady payments or financial stability.  Thus,\nI conclude that she has not made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts. Despite her promises to take\nactions in the future, however sincere, this is not a substitute for a documented track record of remedial\nactions. The Appeal Board has held that \u201ca promise to take remedial steps in the future is not evidence\nof reform or rehabilitation.\u201d20\n\n6\nThe issue is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of her outstanding debts,\nbut whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances\nto warrant a favorable security determination. Her remaining unpaid debt constitutes a security\nconcern.  She has been employed with her current employer since 2002. She has not been able to\nresolve her delinquent debts. Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline\nF.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in\nconduct that has negative implications or presents doubt about her judgment. Despite steady\nemployment, Applicant has accrued multiple delinquent accounts. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\n            Applicant is a 33 year-old naturalized United States citizen, born in the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC).  Applicant\u2019s grandmother and brother are citizens and residents of the PRC, but she\ndoes not have a close relationship with them, Her parents, with whom she has close and continuing\nrelationship, now reside in the United States, and her husband is a United States citizen. The\nevidence establishes that Applicant is not vulnerable to foreign influence. By mitigating these\nforeign influence security concerns, Applicant has demonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue her security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant filed a notarized Response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, dated December\n11, 2006, and she requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On February 8, 2007,\nthe case was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge, but it was then reassigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on February 20, 2007, to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice, dated\nMarch 2, 2007, a hearing was conducted on March 28, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered 10 documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits\n1- 10) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered four  documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-D)\nand offered her own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on April 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign\nresidency and/or citizenship of close family members and foreign travel. The SOR contains four\nallegations, 1.a., through 1.d., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The\nadmissions are incorporated herein as  findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 33 year old employee of a defense contractor that wants her to have a security\nclearance. She was born in the PRC and first came to the United States in 1991, at the age of 17. She\nbecame a naturalized United States citizen in 1995. \nApplicant\u2019s was married from 1991 to 1996, and she has been remarried since 2005. Her\ncurrent husband is a PRC born, naturalized, United States citizen. Applicant has no children.\n\n3\nApplicant  received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science in 1990 from United\nStates university, and she is working toward a Masters Degree. She maintains a 3.9 Grade Point\nAverage while working full time.  \n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has immediate\nfamily members or people to whom she may be bound by affection or obligation, who are not\ncitizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. \nApplicant's grandmother and brother are citizens and residents of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s\ngrandmother is 92 years old. She has never been employed outside of the home. Her brother is\nunemployed, he takes care of his grandmother, and he is studying English in preparation for\nimmigrating to the United States. Neither of them ever had any affiliation with the PRC\nGovernment. Applicant only talks to them by telephone one or two times a year. Her relationship\nis not close to them. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are PRC citizens. They both have resident alien status from the U. S.,\nand they reside here with Applicant. Her mother moved to the United States in 2005 and her father\nin 2006. Both parents are retired.  Applicant\u2019s  father was a high school math teacher and her mother\nwas a nurse. Neither of her parents ever worked for, or had any affiliation with, the PRC\nGovernment. Applicant\u2019s father receives a pension of approximately $300 a month and her mother\ngets $100 a month, which go to support her brother and grandmother.\nApplicant\u2019s mother petitioned the Government in October 2003, to allow her brother to\nimmigrate to the United States. \nSince Applicant came to the United States, she has traveled to the PRC on three occasions\n1993, 1997, and  her last visit in 2002.  The primary reason for these visits was to see her parents.\nApplicant was never employed in the PRC. She does not have any financial interest in the\nPRC. She is the sole owner of a condominium  in the United States. Applicant also testified that she\nhas voted in the last three U.S. elections since she became a citizen, and she plans to remain in the\nUnited States for the rest of her life. \nCurrent Status of the PRC\nSince Applicant's grandmother and brother are citizens and residents of the PRC, it is\nimportant to consider the status of the PRC at this time.\nThe PRC, the most populous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an\nimportant trading partner of the United States. It is run by the Communist Party which controls all\naspects of the PRC government. It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.\nAlthough there has been some cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the United\n\n4\nStates in the past. The PRC has an extremely large army, a sophisticated defense establishment, and\nspace capability. The PRC has launched satellites, has ballistic missiles, has nuclear arms, and\nnuclear bombs. Its diplomatic and military dispute with the Republic of China (Taiwan),\nforeshadows a possible military conflict, which the United States opposes as a resolution of the\nconflict. The PRC has an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary killings; detention\nor incarceration without notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; no\nright to a public, fair trial; a politically controlled judiciary; lack of due process; restrictions on free\nspeech, on religious freedom, on freedom of travel, on freedom of assembly; and no rights of privacy\n- family, home or correspondence. \nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an extensive network of\nbusinesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.\nOne approach is to covertly conduct espionage by personnel from government ministries,\ncommissions, institutes, and military industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services. This\nis believed to be the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States. It also tries to\nidentify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information, and\nsometimes is able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers (Exhibits 6\nand 8).\nPOLICIES\n           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\nan individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions\nraising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances\npresented. Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in\nEnclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or\nagainst clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect\nconsideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an\napplicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and\nconsideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the\nlikelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant\nhas a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As\nnoted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n\n5\n(1988), \"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, and having assessed the credibility of Applicant, I conclude the following with respect to\nGuideline B:\nBased on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny\nApplicant a security clearance under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), because Applicant\u2019s\ngrandmother and brother are citizens and residents of the PRC. The citizenship and residency of\nApplicant's family members creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure. As Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are citizens of and reside in the\nPRC, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States, Applicant has\na very heavy burden of showing that these family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case\nNo. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002.)  \nThe possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present\nevidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of persuasion that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her. This\nApplicant has done.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) I find that DC (a) applies, contact with\nforeign family members, who are citizens and residents in a foreign country, if that contact creates\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation pressure of coercion. \nI have reviewed the overall record and the totality of the evidence, and considered: the lack\nof PRC government involvement of Applicant\u2019s family, currently and in the past; the limited contact\nwith Applicant and her grandmother and brother; the fact that her parents now live in the United\nStates, and her husband is a United States citizen and resident; her history since coming to the\nUnited States and living here almost half of her life, attending two universities and receiving one\ndegree while working on a second one; and her strong feelings concerning this country. Based on\nthis, I have determined that her family members in the PRC do not constitute an unacceptable\nsecurity risk. Mitigating Condition (MC) (b), there is no conflict because the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest, applies to this case. MC (c) also applies\nbecause the contact with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that\nit could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline B , I conclude that the mitigating\nevidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and even in the unlikely event\npressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, she would resist it.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over Alcohol\n1\nConsumption (Guideline G) in paragraph 1, and Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) in paragraph 2\nbased on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines  issued on December 29, 2005, and\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant responded to\nthese SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on October 20, 2006, where he admitted all of the\nallegations with explanation in paragraph 1 and in paragraph 2.  He requested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on January 3, 2007, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The matter\nwas assigned to me on January 8, 2007. Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was\nagreed to.  A Notice of Hearing, issued on January 17, 2007, set the matter for February 5, 2007, at\na location near where Applicant works and lives. While Applicant did not receive the notice until\nJanuary 24, 2007, he believed he had sufficient notice to prepare and waived the 15-day notice\nrequirement.  (TR 13)\nAt the hearing the Government offered one exhibit  (Exhibit 1) which was admitted into\nevidence.  (TR 19-20) Applicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Exhibits A through C.\nGovernment\u2019s counsel indicated no objection, so the documents were admitted into evidence. (TR\n20-24)  The transcript (TR) was received on February 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\n  \nApplicant, 29 years old, has worked for a defense contractor in State #1 from May 2004 to\n\n3\npresent.  He completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in May 2004 and is seeking a top\nsecret clearance.  He was granted an interim security clearance.  Previously, he worked at a private\nsector company in 2003 until he was terminated.  He then returned to a state agency where he had\nworked earlier and worked for a state contractor from 2003 to 2004.  Initially, he had worked for the\nstate agency as an intern in 2002, and later was employed there in 2002 as a web applications\nprogrammer.  He attended community college from 1997 to 1999 where he received an associate of\nscience degree; he then attended college in State #1 from 2000 to 2002.  He received his Bachelor\nof Science (BS) degree in computer information systems  in May 2002.  (Exhibit 1; TR 8; 28-37; 49;\n68-69) Applicant is not married and has no children. (Exhibit 1; TR 39)\nAlcohol and Criminal Conduct\nApplicant began to drink in 1994 as a minor and was arrested twice in 1997 when he was 19:\nhis first arrest was for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) in March 1997 and his second was for\npossessing alcohol as a minor in August 1997 when he accepted a beer at a state fair. He pleaded\nguilty to both charges and had to pay fines and do community service; he also served six months on\nprobation.  The charges were dismissed when he completed the terms of probation. When he was\nin college his alcohol abuse was at its peak; \u201csince college, it has declined significantly.\u201d\nNevertheless, he was arrested again in January 2006 after he registered .132 on the Blood Alcohol\ntest and was charged with DUI and Illegal Turn. Initially, he went to a game with his girlfriend and\nlet her drive as he had consumed liquor; he decided to have her drive as he did not want to risk\ndrinking and driving while he had a security clearance.  However, later that evening  they decided\nto break up, so he drove home twenty miles even though he was intoxicated.  He pleaded guilty to\na reduced charge of Driving While Ability Impaired and was sentenced to one year probation, 20\nhours of community service and ordered to attend an alcohol awareness program, attend a Mothers\nAgainst Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting, and pay a fine of $528. One of the terms of probation was\nno alcohol consumption.  (Answer; Exhibit C; TR 18; 26-27; 38; 41-60) \nAt the time of the hearing in February 2007 Applicant was still on probation and still in\nalcohol treatment which he had entered in May 2006.  While he has had no diagnosis as an alcoholic,\nApplicant signed a document saying that he would abstain from drinking alcohol at the beginning\nof probation. He has kept that agreement.  Also, he has completed community service and all twelve\nof the required educational sessions.  He was unsure how long he would remain on probation as he\nneeded to complete level 2 therapy in group counseling. He has not yet attended a required\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) class.  ( Exhibit C; TR 18; 26-27; 38; 41-60) His intent is to continue\nto refrain from alcohol. As he is now dating a woman with a three-year old son,  he does not go to\nbars or clubs; he intends to ask her to marry him. .  (TR 63-65)\nUnder the terms of his current probation he is not allowed to drink and is subject to random\nurine tests and Breathalyzer tests when he attends class.  If he were to fail a test, he could have his\nprobation revoked and serve time in jail.  Consequently, he had not had any alcohol since March\n2006 when he went on probation.  He plans to refrain from drinking even after he completes\nprobation as he values his job.  (TR 63-65; 70-71; 73-74)  He has fourteen weeks left of therapy, so\nhe could remain on probation for four to six more months to June or August 2007.  (TR 73)\nIn August 2006, his counseling service reported that Applicant had completed all of the\nrequirements fo the Level II Education program but his counselor had concerns that he only shared\n\n4\nwhen prompted.  He started Level II therapy treatment thereafter and has completed 16 of the\nrequired 34 sessions.  In January 2007 the same counselor stated that Applicant was \u201ccomfortable\u201d\nin the group and was open about his previous alcohol use and arrests.  She concluded that since he\n\u201cseems quiet by nature\u201d that participating in therapy is a \u201cstruggle.\u201d However, she noted that  he does\nanswer questions and provide feedback \u201cwhen prompted.\u201d  (Exhibit C)\nReferences\nApplicant\u2019s project manager, who has a security clearance, testified and recommended\nApplicant for a security clearance as he has an excellent work ethic and makes a key contribution\nto the corporation. This manager has known Applicant for three years and has overseen his\nevaluations since March 2006.  Last year Applicant got a level \u201c4\" rating, the top rating on a four\npoint scale as his work reflected  \u201cfar exceeds expectations.\u201d  This year he is rated as a \u201c3\" as he is\nin a new position and level \u201c4\" ratings are limited to 10 to 20 per cent of the employees and are very\nrare.  Applicant plays two key roles in his new assignment.  This manager has traveled with\nApplicant to visit a customer and has never seen him drink alcohol.  The manager was aware of\nApplicant\u2019s past alcohol-related arrests, but understands that Applicant now abstains from drinking\nany alcohol.   He assessed Applicant as having good skills and has demonstrated what this manager\nis looking for in a long-term employee; he, also, is effective in the current project.  (TR 76-88)\nApplicant\u2019s first supervisor, who supervised him from May 2004 to March 2006, is aware\nof Applicant\u2019s 2006 arrest as he reported it immediately.  He observed that Applicant generally\ndemonstrated a high regard for security and was always very conscientious on security issues.  He\nrecommended Applicant for a security clearance.  (Exhibit A; TR 65-66)\nHis current supervisor since March 2006 recommended him for a security clearance.  She\nalso has known him since he began work at the company in 2004 as they worked on a project\ntogether. She also knew of the 2006 arrest.  She assessed him as \u201can energetic and talented engineer\nthat always brings a positive attitude to any task that he is assigned.\u201d  Overall, she viewed him as \u201ca\nhard working, conscientious employee.\u201d  She endorsed him for a security clearance.  (Exhibit B; TR\n66)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or absence\nof any adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole in evaluating this case, I weighed these relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines:\nGuideline G --Alcohol Consumption\n21. The Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\n\n     Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n3\n       22. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) alcohol-\n4\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.   (b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or\nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment,  regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent. (D) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or\npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; (f)\n5\njudgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n30.  The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations.\n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely\n3\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s problem drinking and his\nalcohol-related arrests in 1997 and 2006.  Thus, Applicant\u2019s conduct falls within disqualifying\nconditions (DC) (a) :  Alcohol-related incidents, such as driving under the influence. His first two\n4\n\nrelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of  an alcohol rehabilitation program;\n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence.  \n       23. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  (a) so much time has passed, or the\n5\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individuals current\u2019 reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement; (b) the\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken\nto overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible\nuse (if an alcohol abuser); (c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress; (d)\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired after-care requirements, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption\nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization, and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified  medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.\n6\narrests occurred in 1997 before he was working; indeed, he was an underage drinker.  He did\ncommunity service and served probation which he successfully completed, so the charges were\ndismissed. However, he continued intermittently to drink to excess, even to the point of intoxication.\nThis conduct led to an arrest in 2006 away from work.  He made a decision to drive home from his\ngirlfriend\u2019s home even though he was intoxicated.  Making an illegal turn, he was arrested and\ncharged with DUI.  His plea to a reduced charge of Driving while Ability Impaired led to a sentence\nof one year\u2019s probation and required alcohol education and therapy sessions as well as a fine of $518.\nApplicant has never been diagnosed with an alcohol abuse problem.  In 2006 he successfully\ncompleted the required alcohol education and has complied with the court-ordered condition that he\ncould not drink. He remains in court-ordered therapy and has completed 16 of the required 34\nsessions.  In January 2007 his counselor stated that Applicant was \u201ccomfortable\u201d in the group and\nwas open about his previous alcohol use and arrest.  She concluded that since he \u201cseems quiet by\nnature\u201d that participating in therapy is a \u201cstruggle.\u201d However, she noted that he does answer\nquestions and provides feedback \u201cwhen prompted.\u201d  \nSignificantly, Applicant promptly reported his 2006 arrest to his supervisors and has retained\ntheir confidence: three supervisors endorsed him for a security clearance and praised his work\nperformance and work ethics.  One manager observed that Applicant has abstained from any use of\nalcohol.  Consequently, I conclude that Applicant mitigated these alcohol-related security concerns\nas he provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he falls within mitigating conditions.     Under\n5\nMC (b), while not officially diagnosed, Applicant has acknowledged issues with alcohol abuse and\nprovided evidence of his actions taken to overcome this problem.  He has fully complied with the\ncourt orders to take an alcohol-awareness class and, equally significant, he established a pattern of\nabstinence from alcohol for over one year since March 2006.  While at the time of the hearing he\nremained on probation, he has fully complied with the court requirements with respect to a required\nalcohol-education course after his 2006 arrest and guilty plea.  He now is a court-required alcohol\ntherapy program where the counselor reports he is cooperating. \nEqually important, his supervisors view his work performance as  good.  His supervisors\n\n       31. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) a single\n6\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (d) individual is currently on parole or probation.\n       32. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (a) so much time has elapsed since the\n7\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individuals reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (b) the person was\npressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution,\njob training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement; \n7\nexpressed confidence in him, and recommended him for a security clearance.  Thus, I conclude he\nestablished MC (c), the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory\nprogress. As noted above, he has demonstrated positive changes in behavior and has complied with\nthe court ordered requirement that he demonstrate sobriety by his record of abstinence from alcohol\nsince March 2006.  \n After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule\nfor  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe government\u2019s security concerns under criminal conduct  parallel the concerns over\n6\nalcohol based on allegation 2.a. and include (a) his multiple lesser offenses and (d) his being\ncurrently on probation as he is in the process of completing his required court-ordered therapy\ntreatment.\nAs discussed above, Applicant provided sufficient evidence of mitigation : under MC (d),\n7\nApplicant demonstrated evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of over a year without recurrence of any criminal activity as there has been no additional\nalcohol-related arrest. Also he supplied evidence of his abstinence from alcohol which is an indicator\nhe will not re-offend.  In addition, there was almost a ten year gap between his youthful arrests and\nhis 2006 incident for which he demonstrated his remorse for this poor judgment in deciding to drive\nwhile impaired.  Given the substantial progress he has made in completing his alcohol education\nrequirement and his commitment to completing the alcohol therapy requirement, I feel confident that\nhis commitment to being alcohol free will lead to his successfully completing his probation\nrequirements.  He demonstrated his willingness to change his life style in order to exhibit his\nrenewed commitment to responsibility and trustworthiness.  Significantly, he persuasively\nestablished an excellent employment record with all of his three supervisors endorsing him for a\nsecurity clearance as discussed above. \nThus, after looking at the whole person and considering the Adjudicative Process factors and\nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 2.a. under SOR Paragraph 2.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

Upon leaving the bar intoxicated, he was arrested for being drunk in public.\n11\nOn August 8, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with being drunk in public. He was\nfound guilty and fined $92. He and former coworkers went to a picnic earlier, and he had five or six\nbeers.  After the picnic, he and his friends continued drinking at a bar to celebrate his birthday.  At\n12\n13\nthe bar, he had \u201ca couple beers and a bunch of shots, which turned out to be about four shots.\u201d  He\n14\nwas intoxicated when leaving the bar, stopped by the police, and arrested for being drunk in public.15\nIn an interview on February 21, 2006, with an authorized investigator for the Department of\nDefense, Applicant admitted driving while impaired or intoxicated from alcohol on an average of\ntwice yearly from about 1989 to at least the fall of 2005.

To date, Applicant continues to have a beer every now and\nthen.  He does not drink to get drunk.\n18\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n19\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n20\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n21\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n22\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n23\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n24\n6\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n24\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nAlcohol consumption is always a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption\noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. The Government has established a\nprima facie case for disqualification under Guideline G, alcohol consumption.\nBetween 1988 and 2004, Applicant had five infractions for either driving while intoxicated\nor being drunk in public. He had his driver\u2019s license suspended two different times, once for six\nmonths and then for two years. He admits driving while impaired or intoxicated from alcohol at least\nonce a year from 1989 to 2005. Thus, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) 22(a)\n(alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving, while under the influence, fighting, child\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuse or alcohol dependent) and AC DC 22(c) (habitual or\nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. The alcohol-related\narrests that occurred in 1988, 1989, and 1993 have not been mitigated by time because the behavior\nis not infrequent and it recurred, casting doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\njudgment. Thus, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) 23(a) (so much time has\npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests in 2000 and 2004, together\nwith the earlier ones, indicate a pattern of excessive drinking by Applicant over a 16-year period. His\ntwo DWI charges occurred in 1988 and 1989. Since 1989, there is no evidence in the record that he\nhas had any other DWI charges. Moreover, the arrests in 2000 and 2004 were for being drunk in\npublic. He was intoxicated to the point of being arrested, but he was not driving. In 2005, his\ngirlfriend was pregnant with his child. He had an epiphany and by December 2005 or January 2006,\n\n7\nhe changed his lifestyle, and drinking excessively was no longer a priority. He modified his drinking\nbehavior, including the quantity consumed. He continues to have a beer every now and then.\nAlthough he has taken credible and responsible steps to avoid further alcohol-related incidents, he\nwill, more likely than not, consume alcohol to excess in the future since he has not abstained from\ndrinking alcohol. Moreover, he has driven while impaired or intoxicated from alcohol at least once\na year from 1989 to 2005. Thus, AC MC 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism\nor issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser)\ndoes not apply. Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegations 1.a\nthrough 1.g of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. At 42,\nApplicant has matured and realized that his earlier behavior with arrests for drinking and driving and\nbeing drunk in public are not favorable character traits. He seemed earnest and credible at the hearing\nregarding his reformed behavior and his consumption of alcohol. He wants to get married, have a\nfamily, and have a career that will enable him to provide for his family. He is more interested in a\nfuture for himself and his family. He now moderates his alcohol consumption, but I cannot conclude\nthat he will not deviate from his moderate drinking and not become inebriated in the future. For the\nreasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption):  AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He has not\nmitigated the security concern under the financial considerations guideline. He did not falsify his\nanswers on his security application form.

Clearance\nis denied.\n\nApplicant's response to the SOR, dated April 2, 2007.\n1\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated January 3, 2006).\n2\nTr. 36.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 3, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On February 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense, effective September 1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on April 2, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 5, 2007. I scheduled a hearing\nfor August 7, 2007. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 7, 2007 to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted.  Applicant's exhibits (AE A-G) were admitted into\nthe record without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant and three witnesses on\nApplicant's behalf, as reflected in the hearing transcript (Tr.) received on August 23, 2007. I left the\nrecord open for Applicant to supplement the record. He timely submitted a packet of information\nwhich is marked as AE H. Department Counsel had no objection. The record closed on August 21,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b61.f, 1.g, and 1.i are incorporated\nherein. He denied all other allegations under subparagraphs 1 and 2 because he disputed he was\nliable.  In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the evidence and exhibits, I make the\n1\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 55-year-old who works for a defense contractor.  He graduated from high\n2\nschool in 1972.  He is married with one step daughter. Applicant has worked in the trucking business\n3\nsince 1979.

On January 3, 2006, he completed a security clearance\n4\napplication (SF 86).5\nApplicant's business career was thriving. He generated millions of dollars in revenue as an\nagent for his company, even earning a plaque for his endeavors. He was earning a significant amount\nof money and his credit was excellent. In or about 1995, Applicant agreed to form a business with\nhis accountant/ attorney after being approached by him. He also considered this man his friend. They\nincorporated for the purpose of entering a trucking business.   They had trucks leased to the large\n6\ncompany and hauled freight for the company. The partner received the money from the corporation\nprofits but did not pay its bills. Applicant learned this approximately one year after the start of the\nbusiness.7\nApplicant's business closed in or about 1997 or 1998.  He had many business debts on credit\n8\ncards issued for the company. He had a lawyer write to credit card companies to explain the\nsituation. Many accounts were charged off.  Applicant denied any  personal liability for the accounts\n9\nbecause they were incurred as part of his incorporated business.10\nAt the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that his brother advised against the corporation\nbecause the future partner did not have good credit and wanted to use Applicant's credit for the\nstartup of the business. He was very vague about the actual beginning and end of the business. In\nfact, at one point in answer to a question, he responded that he has always worked for the trucking\ncompany.  Applicant paid on some of the credit cards for a period of time but could not keep up the\n11\npayments. Applicant acknowledged that he would get calls from various credit card companies and\nthey would offer him credit. He accepted the credit card and after the business had ended, he tried\nto pay some of the debts. He also acknowledged that the credit was offered so that he could pay off\nother bills. It is not clear what business expenses the cards were used for.  \n12\nThe state filed a tax lien against Applicant in March 2005, in the amount of $4,774, which\nApplicant acknowledges. A second state tax lien, in the amount of $4,964, for nonpayment of taxes\nis also acknowledged. Applicant's credit reports reflected the two tax liens filed by the state. He\nthought they had been satisfied earlier, but it is apparent that he was referring to something in the\n\nTr. 57.\n13\nTr. 64.\n14\nTr. 78.\n15\n5\nearlier years.  His answers at the hearing were inconsistent with his admissions in his response to\n13\nthe SOR. He stated that he would look into the matter and if he owed, he would try to work it out.\nNo additional information was submitted on this matter. \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not filed tax returns for 2003 and 2004. He stated\nhe would like to mail them at the same time. He recently gave them to a CPA. Applicant stated that\nhe probably owes taxes on them.14\nApplicant completed a security clearance application on January 3, 2006. In response to\nSection 11, which requested information about employment activities, he did not disclose his joint\nownership in his corporation. Applicant explained that the corporation (a trucking concern) was not\nseparate in his mind from his work as an agent for the large company he worked for. He believed\nsince the endeavor with the corporation only did business with the trucking company and that his\nbusiness had closed, he did not have to list it under his employment.\nOn the same application, Applicant answered  \"no\" to Section 28: Your Financial\nDelinquencies - 180 Days. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)? Applicant stated he answered the questions to the best of his ability. Since he did not\nconsider that he was personally liable for the business debts, he answered \"no\" to the question. He\nexplained that he was not delinquent on any of his personal debts in the last 7 years.\nApplicant answered \"no\" to Section 28: (a) Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days, which\nasked if Applicant was more than 90 days delinquent on any debts. He answered \"no\" for the very\nsame reasons that are discussed above.\nApplicant explained at the hearing he has not been delinquent on his personal accounts. Thus,\nhe answered no the various questions on the security clearance. He thought it referred to a home loan\nor something along those lines. He admitted that he never had to fill out anything so detailed as the\nsecurity questionnaire and that he became very confused.\nAt the present time, Applicant is doing business as an agent for the large trucking company\nthat he represented earlier. His business is mainly with government contractors. He earned\napproximately $60,000 in commission last year. The prior year, he estimates he earned $49,000. His\nnet monthly pay is around $1,400.  He is current on his mortgage and other accounts.\n15\nApplicant's responses to all the debts alleged in the SOR were the same. He did not consider\nthem his own personal debts. He was adamant that because the corporation closed, the accounts were\nwritten off as a business loss. He did dispute the debt in 1.a as having been paid, but he had no\ndocumentation. He admitted there were tax liens and that the two returns in question were not yet\nfiled. Applicant submitted a post hearing document with a corporate credit card bill from 1999, but\n\nTestimony from three witnesses as reflected in Tr.\n16\nAE A-G.\n17\n6\nit was in his own name. He did not have any other evidence to support the fact that the charged off\naccounts were from the failed corporation.\nThe current status of Applicant's alleged debts listed in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nPhone\n         $72\nDisputed\nTr. 43.\n1.b\ncredit card                $30,030\nCharged off (2002)\nGE 4 and 5\n1.c\ncredit card                 $16,045\nCharged off (2003)\nTR. 52; GE 4 and 5\n1.d\ncredit card\n          $13,881\n  \nCharged off (2004)\nTr. 53\n1.e\ncredit card                 $5,094\nCollection (2004)\nTr. 53 \n1.f\nstate tax lien (2005)\nUnpaid\nGE 4, 5. \n1.g\nstate tax lien (2005)\nUnpaid\nsame as above\n1.h\ngas  b  i l l                        $129\nPaid\nTr. 65; GE 5 \n1.i\ntax returns  (2003-2004)\nNot filed\nTr. 58\nApplicant is highly recommended by his friends and social associates. His long time family\nfriends attest to his honesty and loyalty. Each witness praised Applicant as a family man. He is\nprofessional in his dealings with others.  He is honest and forthright. He is also involved in\n16\ncommunity activities and helped in a project after Hurricane Katrina. Applicant submitted seven\nletters of recommendation.17\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes.

Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n18\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n19\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n20\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n21\ndecision.22\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n23\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n24\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n25\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n26\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\n\n AG \u00b6 18.\n27\n8\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.27\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued delinquent\ndebts that are still outstanding debts. He also has two state tax liens from 2005 that have not been\npaid. He admits that he has not yet filed his taxes for several years. Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) FC DC, \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC, \u00b6 19(g) (failure\nto file annual Federal, state or local income tax returns) apply.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Applicant formed a\ncorporation with a partner, whom he described as a friend and his lawyer. The fact that his partner did\nnot pay the corporation's bills does not qualify as a condition beyond his control. Therefore, FC MC,\nAG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. \nThe tax liens are still not resolved. He has not filed his 2003 and 2004 tax returns. Therefore,\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC), \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not\napply.\nApplicant has not received financial counseling. Applicant has not shown that his problems\nare being resolved or are under control.  FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control) does not apply. \nApplicant denied any personal liability for the charged off accounts. He paid two bills listed\nin the SOR. He has not yet paid his tax liens and his taxes. This has been ongoing. He has not initiated\nany kind of repayment plan. Therefore, FC MC, \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.\nFC MC, AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) does not apply. Applicant has\npresented some documentation concerning his corporation. However, he has not presented sufficient\ndocumentation that the debts were business expenses. His one statement from 1999 from a corporate\ncredit card has his name on it, not the corporate name. Applicant did not meet his burden of proof in\nthe case.\n.\nPersonal Conduct.

Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.28\nIn response to Section 11: Your Employment Activities, Applicant listed only his employment\nwith the trucking company from 1985 to the present. He did not list the failed corporation. He\nexplained that he thought since the work was basically the same, he did not think of listing the\ncorporation. The question does not specifically mention any corporate endeavors or partnerships. He\nstated that he was a bit confused by the long, detailed security form. I find this credible and thus, I do\nnot find that this was an intentional misrepresentation. \nOn January 3, 2006, Applicant, in response to Section 28: Your Financial Delinquencies -\n180 Days answered \"no.\" When he responded to the question, he believed it referred to his personal\ncredit under his own social security number. Since he had none (except the tax liens) he answered\n\"no.\" He answered \"no\" also to the question concerning 90 days delinquent for the same reason.\nUnder DC 16 (a), the government established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his\nanswer to Section 28. He denies however that he deliberately falsified his answer to this question.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof\nof an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an Applicant's intent or state of mind when\nthe omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence regarding an Applicant's intent or state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC 16 (a)  (deliberate omission, concealment, or\n29\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from an personnel security questionnaire . . .) to apply,\nthe government must establish that Applicant' omission, concealment or falsification in his answer\nwas deliberate. I do not find that this was a deliberate falsification. I find in favor of Applicant for\npersonal conduct.\nWhole Person\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis an earnest, trusting individual who has worked hard all his life. However, he did not take the\nnecessary financial vigilance in his corporation. He has not been financially responsible with the tax\nliens or the filing of his taxes. He has an excellent reputation in his community, however that does\nnot absolve him from meeting his financial responsibilities.\nApplicant has two unpaid tax liens. He also has not filed his tax returns. He has not persuaded\nme that the delinquent debts are for the corporation. He submitted information that he used a credit\ncard in 1999 but that is not sufficient to overcome the government's case. He plans to have his CPA\nfile his taxes when he gets the paperwork together. His failure to pay his state tax debt is not\noutweighed by the favorable findings. Accordingly for the reasons stated, I find that it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.\n\n See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n30\n10\nIn weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances,\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining\nto financial considerations.\nSubstantial evidence does not support Applicant's eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. I take this position based on the law, my \"careful consideration of the whole person\nfactors\"  and supporting evidence, as well as my application of the pertinent factors under the\n30\nAdjudicative Process and my interpretation of my responsibilities. For the reasons stated, I conclude\nApplicant is not eligible for his security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant\u2019s actions represent a pattern of criminal conduct for which too little\ntime has elapsed to mitigate security concerns.

Based on his debt accumulations and lack of tangible progress in addressing them, he fails\nto  mitigate financial concerns.  Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 20, 2006, and requested a hearing.  The case\nwas assigned to me on February 5, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on March 27, 2007.  The\nhearing was rescheduled for April 3, 2007.  A hearing was April 3, 2007, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of five\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and seven exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was\nreceived on April 11, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record open to permit\nhim the opportunity to supplement the record with payment information regarding one of his\ncreditors.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  The\nGovernment, in turn was allowed three days to respond.  Applicant did not supplement the record.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested on multiple occasions between\nJuly 1980 and February 2003 for assorted charges, and convicted in connection with three of the\ncharged offenses.  Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated eight delinquent\ndebts in excess of $11,000.00.\n\n3\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the alleged debts, with explanations.\nHe denied only his being arrested in April 2001 for discharging a firearm in city limits.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nApplicant is a 44 year-old computer operator for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant was first married in 1981.   He divorced his first wife (W1) in January 1986, and\nmarried his second wife (W2) in June 1989 (see ex. 1).  His second marriage lasted four years.\nFollowing their divorce in January 1993, he married for the third time in May 1994 to W3.\nApplicant and W3 dissolved their marriage in February 2002.  He has no children from any of his\nfirst three marriage (R.T., at 49), but has a daughter (age 20) from another woman (born in 1986);\nhe pays no current child support for this daughter (R.T., at 49).  Applicant married his current wife\n(W4) in November 2005.  She has two children from another marriage, who reside with  her and\nApplicant.  Applicant is the sole source of income for his family (R.T., at 44); albeit WR receives\nchild support from one of the children\u2019s father in the amount of $300.00 a month (R.T., at 49-50).\nApplicant\u2019s arrest record\nBetween 1980 and 1990, Applicant was twice arrested: once in July 1980 (while 17 years of\nage) for receiving stolen things and again in April 1990 for driving under the influence (DuI).\nCharges were dropped on the receiving stolen things charges (involving a watch which he pawned\nfor his girlfriend at the time).\nOver the course of the ensuing 10 years, Applicant was able to avoid any problems with law\nenforcement authorities.  However, in April 1990, he was arrested and charged with DuI.  He\npleaded guilty and was placed on one year of probation.  \nIn October 1997, Applicant was arrested for DuI and possession of a controlled substance\n(less than 2 to 8 grams).  He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of DuI and the possession charge was\ndropped (R.T., at 40-41, 65-66).  He was then sentenced to two years probation and fined $1,000.00.\nWhen he was arrested again for DuI in February 1999, his probation was revoked, and he was\nrequired to serve his full 90 days in jail (R.T., at 69-79).  Applicant actually served just 45 days of\nhis 90-day sentence.  Initially, Applicant attributed his probation revocation to a drug test he failed\nat work (R.T., at 80), before acknowledging that it was his February 1999 DuI offense that resulted\nin his probation revocation.\nIn May 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly\nweapon.  Claiming the incident did not happen as W3 reported the incident, he contested the charges.\nWhen W3 determined not to press the charges, they were dismissed (R.T., at 39-40).  Applicant\nadmits, though, to brandishing a loaded gun in the presence of his wife during a heated argument\nwith her (R.T., at 66-68).\n\n4\nApplicant was charged with discharging a firearm in the city in April 2001.  Applicant\nassures he was unloading a 9 mm handgun in his home when the pistol accidentally discharged\n(R.T., at 42-43).  He was subsequently found guilty and fined $150.00.  Applicant no longer owns\nthe pistol, or any other  handguns (R.T., at 81).  On the day following his firearm arrest, Applicant\nwas arrested again: this time  for alleged telephone harassment following a heated argument he had\nwith his brother.  After Applicant spent the first 72 hours following his arrest in jail, his brother\ndropped the charges, and the charges were dismissed (R.T., at 42).  No inferences of wrongdoing dan\nbe drawn against Appellant based just on his reported exchange with his brother and his brother\u2019s\nfiling a report with the police.\nIn February 2003, Applicant pleaded guilty to obtaining prescription drugs by fraud (by\naltering a prescription for 15 codeine pills to 75 pills).  The court accepted Applicant\u2019s guilty plea\nand entered a conviction for the offense (a felony).  At his sentencing hearing in September 2003,\nthe court sentenced him to three years probation.  He received a first offender pardon covering this\nconviction in September 2006 upon his documented showing he completed his probation conditions\n(ex. E).  His pardon does not include the right to receive, possess or transport a firearm, or constitute\na waiver of any unpaid fines and fees, due and owing.  However, there do not appear to be any\nunpaid fines or fees.\nBoth in court and at this hearing, Appellant accepted responsibility for his 2003 conviction\nfor altering a  prescription form.  Both in his 2004 security clearance application (SF-86) and answer\nhe attributed the actual alteration to a friend, while he accepted responsibility for it in court (see ex.\n1).  He did not mention his conviction or probation, however, in his answers to questions 21 and 24\nBoth in his answer and hearing testimony, he acknowledged both.  He also identified the friend who\naltered his prescription form in his hearing testimony (on the assumption confidentiality) as W4\n(R.T., at 89-91).  W4 did not testify at either proceeding and has never publicly acknowledged\nresponsibility for the offense.\nWhile Applicant appears sincere in his assigning the actual altering of the prescription form\nto W4, he provides no oral or written corroboration from W4.  Conceivably, this information might\nprovide cause for reopening the case concerning his February 2003 offense.  Collateral estoppel\nprinciples do not enable an ancillary body like this one, though, to undo Applicant\u2019s guilty\nconviction.  At most, his testimony might warrant some extenuation consideration.  Both raised\nconcerns about his initial credibility on his account of his 2003 conviction and probation (associated\nwith his failure to acknowledge his probation status in his 2004 SF-86) and the absence of oral or\nwritten corroboration from W4 preclude acceptance of his attribution claims based solely on his\nstatements.  \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nApplicant accumulated a number of consumer-related debts before consummating his\nmarriage to W4 in November 2005. He attributed his financial problems to periodic periods of\nunemployment over a number of years spanning 1997 and 2003 (R.T., at 56).   Altogether, Applicant\naccumulated eight debts, exceeding $11,000.00, which he permitted to become delinquent.  He\nclaims to have satisfied one of these debts (his debt to creditor 1.d), but provides no documentation.\nHe disputes his creditor 1.g debt, too: He claims this debt represents a deficiency on his vehicle that\nwas repossessed in 2001.  This repossession deficiency is listed in his 2005 credit report (ex. 5).\n\n5\nWhile he claims the repossessed vehicle was almost paid for and should have brought more than the\namount owing at public sale of the vehicle (R.T., at 60-61, 92-93), he provides no evidence of any\nfollow-up clarification demands from the creditor after obtaining his creditor report.  Nor does he\nprovide any documented information about his identity theft claims (see ex. F).\nIn his 2004 SF-86, Applicant committed to contact his creditors and try to make\narrangements to correct his outstanding debts (see ex. 1).  To date, though, he has neither paid nor\ncontacted any of the other seven creditors (R.T., at 54, 63-64) and doesn\u2019t know when he will be able\nto do so (given the uncertainty of his current job status).  He has received no financial counseling\nand has no identified plan to repay any of his remaining creditors at this time.\nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors and colleagues and documents excellent\nperformance evaluations (see exs. A and D).  He has received several certificates of training and\nappreciation (exs. B and C), as well as some very positive customer responses for the services he has\ndelivered in behalf of his employer (see ex. G).  \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead\n\n6\nto financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a meritorious computer operator who has been involved in a number of\ncriminally-related incidents between 1980 and 2003, five of which resulted in convictions for assorted\noffenses (DuI, discharging a firearm and most recently, altering a drug prescription form, a felony).\nSecurity concerns are also raised over Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts: specifically, eight debts\nthat exceed $11,000.00 in the aggregate.  Unable to address his debt delinquencies heretofore,\nApplicant does not know when he will be able to pay on his debts. \nCriminal conduct issues\nFollowing his 1980 arrest for receiving stolen things, Applicant avoided any confrontations\nwith law enforcement for almost a decade.  This all changed in October 1997 when he was arrested\nand convicted of DuI.  He experienced five additional arrests between October 1997 and February\n2003.  Four of these arrests resulted in convictions (i.e., his 1997 and 1999 DuI arrests, his 2001\ndischarging a firearm arrest, and his 2003 obtaining medication by false pretenses arrest.  While the\ncharges relating to his May 1998 aggravated assault arrest were dismissed, Applicant admits to\nbrandishing the weapon in from of the W3.  As a result, some criminal conduct on Applicant\u2019s part\n\n7\nis evidenced.  No inferences of criminal conduct are associated with his 2001 firearm arrest, which\nalso resulted in dismissed charges.   \nApplicant\u2019s reported criminal offenses (six supported by convictions)  warrant the application\nof two disqualifying conditions of the  Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: DC a (A single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses), DC c (Allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged) and DC e (Violation of parole or probation,\nor failure to complete a court-mandated  rehabilitation program).  Applicant\u2019s 1990 DuI arrest and\n1980 receiving stolen things arrest are separated by almost two years, as Applicant correctly claims.\nHis most recent arrests reflect a considerable pattern of illicit activity, however, beginning with his\n1997 DuI arrest/conviction and culminating 16 years later with his arrest/conviction for receiving\nmedication by false prescription. \nCollateral estoppel principles preclude any reconsideration of Applicant\u2019s 2003 conviction\nin light of his hearing claims attributing the altering of the prescription drug form at issue to his wife.\nOur Appeal Board has consistently held that an applicant is estopped from contending that he or she\ndid not engage in the criminal acts for which he or she was convicted.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-\n0116 (May 1, 2000), at p. 2; ISCR Case No. 96-0587 (March 24, 1997), at p. 2; ISCR Case No. 95-\n0817 (February 21, 1997, at p. 3.  Collateral estoppel applies to a criminal conviction whether the\nconviction is based on a verdict after trial or is based on a guilty plea (as here).  See ISCR Case No.\n94-1213 (June 7, 1996), at p.3.  Due process observed in the courts and in DOHA hearings simply\ndoes not permit an applicant the right to relitigate matters that have been adjudicated in a prior due\nprocess proceeding.  See, e.g., Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153-54 (1979).  While\nApplicant might find sufficient cause to warrant reopening of his case with evidence of another\u2019s\nculpability, our jurisdiction does not permit passing judgment on the proceedings and decisions in\ncriminal cases conducted by Federal and state courts.  \nTo be fair, Applicant\u2019s belated attribution of the prescription alteration underlying his 2003\nconviction could merit some extenuation.  However, Applicant declined to develop the facts in any\nfurther detail out of respect for his wife.  This is very understandable.  Absent any more details of her\ninvolvement and corroboration from W4 herself in the face of some raised challenges to his own\ncredibility associated with his failure to mention his probation status in his completed security\nclearance application, no meaningful extenuating value may be assigned to Applicant\u2019s attribution\nof responsibility to W4.  \nAmong the eight criminal offenses Applicant was cited for over a 23-year period, he was\nconvicted on six occasions.  Two of the cases were dismissed based on complaining witnesses\ndeclining to prosecute; of these two cases, only one is free of any Applicant culpability. The pattern\nof criminal conduct reflected in his string of arrests spanning 23 years is significant and is still\nrelatively recent.  The first offender pardon he received in 2006 recites his completion of his probation\nterms and is probative of his efforts to comply with the conditions set by the court.   Besides meeting\nhis probation conditions, he has also exhibited commendable efforts in caring for his family and\nfulfilling his professional responsibilities.   These efforts reflect positively on his character.  \nStill, Applicant\u2019s actions and efforts to date are insufficient to warrant the application of any\nof the mitigation conditions at this time.  For Applicant\u2019s cited conduct was neither aged nor isolated.\nAnd his restorative efforts, while commendable and encouraging, are still not sufficient at this time\n\n8\nto warrant conclusions of clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.   Taking  into account all of the\nfacts and circumstances developed in the record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c through 1.h of the SOR.  Sub-paragraph 1.b warrants\nfavorable conclusions.\nFinancial issues\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual appellant is so financially overextended as to indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\nraise questions about an the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAppellant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his failure to document payments on any of his\nlisted debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations: DC a (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and DC c (A history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\n Applicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to periods of unemployment.  Since commencing\nhis current employment in 2004, however, he has made little tangible headway in addressing his\nidentified delinquent debts.  His debt accumulations are cumulative, factually undisputed, and still\nunresolved.  His current wife\u2019s health problems, while difficult for him to cope with, were not\ncausally linked to the debt delinquencies that accrued before their marriage.  Finally, Applicant has\nnot taken advantage of any counseling and consolidation program to assist him in resolving his debts.\nSo, while his debts are partially extenuated by his employment circumstances and entitle to some\nbenefit from MC b (The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances),  his\nsubsequent failures to responsibly address his debts and seek counseling precluded him from taking\nadvantage of any of the other mitigating conditions of the financial considerations guideline. \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.   Financial stability in a person cleared\nto access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of\nthe clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties\nis vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases\n(as here) and bring into play security concerns covered by both the financial consideration and\npersonal conduct guidelines.  \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt\naccumulations and minimal documented steps he has taken to resolve them, Applicant fails to\nmitigate security concerns related to his longstanding debt delinquencies and judgment lapses\nassociated therein.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-\nparagraphs 2.a through 2.h of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E\n2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of the\nFINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.e: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.h:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s failure to mitigate his excessive alcohol consumption raises security\nconcerns.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On October 16, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and Department\n1\nof Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under revised Adjudicative Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\npromulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs issued as of\nSeptember 1, 2006, and thereafter.  With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy of the\nDirective and the applicable revised Adjudicative Guideline.  Applicant executed a written response\nto the SOR on November 2, 2006.  He requested his case be determined on the record in lieu of a\nhearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 27, 2006.\nThe FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 6.  On December 29,2006, a copy of\nthe FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or\nobjections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on January 22, 2007.  He did not\nsubmit any information within 30 days after receiving a copy of the FORM.  On March 28, 2007, the\ncase was assigned to me for a decision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline G, Alcohol\nConsumption.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all six allegations.  His admissions are\nincorporated as findings of fact.\nApplicant is 50 years old and employed as a supervisory machinist by a defense contractor.\nHe was married for the first time in 1977 and divorced in 1979.  He married again in 1987 and remains\nmarried to his second wife.  He is the father of an adult child.  (Item 5.)\nApplicant admits consuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1973 to at least February 2006.  Between 1983 and 1987, he was arrested three times\nand charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI).  After each of those arrests, he attended an\nAlcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP).  (Item 1; Item 4.)\n\nAccordingly, I find no merit in the Government\u2019s assertion that DC 22 (f) applies.  (FORM, Argument at 3.)\n3\n3\nIn June 2003, Applicant was again arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated.   He\nwas given first offender status.  He pled guilty to the charge and was fined approximately $250.  He\nwas sentenced to 30 days in jail, sentence suspended,.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended for 12\nmonths, and he was ordered to attend ASAP.  (Item 1; Item 6.)\nApplicant completed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on December 3, 2004.\nQuestion 30 on the SF-86 asks: \u201cYour Use of Alcohol.  In the last 7 years has your use of alcoholic\nbeverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as\nfor alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 30 and listed ASAP\ntreatment from October to December 2003.  In his answer to the SOR, he acknowledged he received\nprofessional counseling in 2003 for his alcohol consumption in a program set up through his employer.\nNothing in the record sustains a finding that Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent or an\nalcohol abuser.   While Applicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in the past, he no longer does\n3\nso.  However, he retains contact information for AA in case his future alcohol consumption should get\nout of control.  Applicant prefers that people at his workplace not know about  his alcohol-related\narrests and his alcohol consumption.  (Item 1; Item 6.)  \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20,\n1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-20700 at 3.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol Consumption\n\nDC 22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, child\n4\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  DC 22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \n4\nApplicant\u2019s admitted consumption of alcohol to excess and at times to intoxication spans a\nperiod of  approximately 33 years.  Excessive alcohol consumption raises security concerns because\nit often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, thus raising\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  Guideline G 21. \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions show he was arrested three times between\n1983 and 1987 and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol.  After each arrest he was\ndirected to enroll in an alcohol safety awareness program.  In 2003, he was arrested for and pled guilty\nto driving under the influence of alcohol again.  He was fined, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for\none year, and he was again ordered to attend ASAP.  Applicant subsequently received counseling for\nhis alcohol consumption in an employee assistance program sponsored by his employer.  In his\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted a connection with AA.  However, he did not participate in\nthe program but kept a contact number to call if his drinking were to get out of control.  He did not\nwant those who worked with him to know about his alcohol consumption and his alcohol-related\narrests.\nThe alcohol-related conduct alleged in the SOR and admitted by Applicant raises concerns\nunder Disqualifying Condition (DC) 22(a) and  DC 22(c).   His four alcohol arrests away from work\n4\nraise concerns under DC 22(a).  His admitted habitual consumption of alcohol to excess and\nsometimes to the point of intoxication for more than 30 years raises concerns under DC 22 (c). \nApplicant provided no evidence to rebut or mitigate the allegations of disqualifying conduct\nin the SOR.  After a review of the Guideline G mitigating conditions, I find that none apply to the facts\nof this case. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, an\nadministrative judge must thoroughly consider and review of all available reliable information about\nthe appellant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.  DoD\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, describes this process of scrutiny and evaluation as \u201cthe whole\nperson concept.\u201d  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant began consuming alcohol to excess when he was approximately seventeen years old.\nHe has continued his excessive consumption of alcohol for over 30 years.  He has received alcohol\ncounseling four times after arrests for driving under the influence, and after the counseling, he returned\nto the excessive use of alcohol, suggesting that rehabilitation was not achieved.  His concern that his\n\n5\nuse of alcohol and his alcohol-related arrests should not be made known to the people he works with\nmay suggest he has not acknowledged his problems with alcohol. \nIn ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec.27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states that an\nadministrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust consider the record as a\nwhole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.\u201d  I have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s\nconduct under the whole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that Applicant has neither\nrebutted nor mitigated the security concerns raised by the allegations in the SOR, and he has not\ndemonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline G.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nR. Burl McCoy, Esq.\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 26, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 24, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nWith regard to Guideline E, Applicant argues that the government did not prove that\nApplicant falsified his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) by deliberately failing to disclose a\nSeptember 2004  mental evaluation at a state hospital. The Board agrees that the Judge\u2019s finding that\nApplicant falsified his SF 86 was error.  The Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\nis limited to determining if they are supported by substantial record evidence\u2013such relevant evidence\nas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3. 1.32.1.  In this case, the weight of the record\nevidence that runs contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding of falsification is of sufficient magnitude to render\nthat finding unsustainable.\nApplicant had a domestic dispute with his wife in September 2004.  During that incident,\naccording to his wife, Applicant talked about hurting himself.  Applicant\u2019s wife called the police.\nThe police obtained a mental detention warrant and proceeded to Applicant\u2019s residence.  Upon\narrival at the residence, an officer informed Applicant that he possessed a court order stating that\nApplicant had to go to a local hospital for a mental evaluation.  Applicant, who was expecting the\narrival of his parents from out of town, asked the officer, \u201ccould we do it later?\u201d  The officer replied\nin the negative and Applicant went with the police without being handcuffed.  Once at the hospital,\nApplicant spent 15 minutes with a physician.  They discussed Applicant\u2019s marital problems and the\ndoctor recommended marriage counseling.  They discussed an anti-depressant that Applicant was\ntaking at the time and the doctor suggested to Applicant that he might want to double the dose and\nget follow-up therapy.  The doctor then told Applicant that he was fine and to go home.  The police\ntook Applicant home without further incident and told him to have a nice day.\nQuestion 21 of the SF 86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you consulted with a mental health\nprofessional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with another health\ncare provider about a mental health related condition?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d and provided the\ndates, location, and the name of the therapist/doctor for a regimen of mental health treatment that\ntook place between January and February 2005 (he also listed this treatment when answering\nQuestion 25 relating to alcohol treatment).  In the \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d section of the SF 86,\nApplicant also listed a voluntary (not mandated or court-instructed) alcohol rehabilitation treatment\nprogram he participated in between June 7 and June 12, 2004.\nThe record evidence indicates, therefore, that Applicant freely revealed two other interactions\nof significant duration he had with mental health professionals.  On the facts of this case, these\ndisclosures, standing alone, significantly undercut any notion that Applicant had a motive to conceal\nhis mental health history from the government.  These interactions were initiated by the voluntary\nactions of Applicant (the 2005 regimen had been suggested to him by health care providers who were\n\n3\naware of his problems with alcohol\u2013the submission to the June 2004 treatment was purely voluntary\non Applicant\u2019s part).  By contrast, the September 2004 incident was an involuntary interaction that\nfollowed a domestic incident, involved the police, and was of very short duration (Applicant spent\napproximately 15 minutes with a mental health professional who spent a significant part of that time\ndiscussing Applicant\u2019s marital problems).  Applicant testified at the hearing that at the time he\ncompleted Question 21 on the SF 86, it never dawned on him that the September 2004 incident\nshould be listed.  This expression of his state of mind at the time he answered Question 21 is strongly\nsupported by the disclosures he made on the SF 86 and by other record evidence.\nViewed objectively, Question 21 arguably encompasses the type of interaction that took place\nin September 2004.  However, it is not a precise fit.  The question speaks in terms of \u201cconsultations\u201d\nwith mental health professionals.  Being taken involuntarily by the police after a domestic incident\nto a court-ordered emergency mental health referral that lasted only a few minutes might not qualify\nas a mental health consultation in the minds of many.  The fact that the scenario presented by this\ncase is less than clearly contemplated by the question is a significant factor to be considered when\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s state of mind.  Indeed, Applicant\u2019s other experiences with mental health\nprofessionals, which he readily listed on his SF 86, differed markedly in circumstance from his brief\nencounter in September 2004.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations as to why he did not list the September 2004 incident are consistent\nand express a recurring theme.  Applicant reveals that although it was his understanding that he had\nnot been arrested, he was taken involuntarily to the hospital by the police.  His statements, taken as\na whole, indicate that he viewed the episode as a law enforcement incident as opposed to an instance\nof mental health treatment.  In his answer to the SOR on the falsification allegation, he did not admit\nthe allegation, and, by way of explanation, he indicated that he did not think he had been arrested.\nDuring his hearing testimony, when offering an explanation as to why he did not include the\nSeptember 2004 incident on the SF 86, Applicant stated, \u201cI was very forthcoming from beginning\nto end with it as far as arrests and any other issues with the law.  There was no reason for me not to\nhave included that if I had known I was arrested.\u201d  This focus on the September 2004 incident as\nprimarily a law enforcement matter continued during questioning of the Applicant by the Judge.\nWith reference to Question 21, the Judge asked, \u201c. . . why didn\u2019t you think that it [the incident with\nthe police] was a consultation with a mental health professional?\u201d  Applicant answered, \u201cYour\nHonor, it just did not dawn on me.  I don\u2019t know why.  But if the arrest\u2013I didn\u2019t know I was arrested,\nand I\u2019m not sure I actually was.  May be it\u2019s a generic form that the county uses for a mental health\npickup.\u201d  After stating to Applicant that he didn\u2019t think whether Applicant was or was not arrested\nwas pertinent to the question, the Judge asked him, \u201cIf you walked in voluntarily and talked to this\nguy for 15 minutes and walked out voluntarily, would you have disclosed it then?\u201d Applicant\nanswered, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s unwavering focus on the law enforcement component of the\nincident, along with its involuntary nature provides strong evidence that his state of mind was such\nthat it honestly never occurred to him that the September 2004 incident fit the question.            \nGiven the totality of the circumstantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s state of mind, the Judge\u2019s\nfinding that Applicant stated he did not include the incident on the SF 86 because \u201cit slipped his\nmind\u201d is not an accurate characterization of the evidence.  Additionally, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant \u201chad no persuasive explanation why he did not disclose it when it occurred in the midst\nof his other rehabilitation programs and later DUI arrest\u201d fails to take into consideration significant\nrecord evidence such as that discussed in preceding paragraphs.  The record, considered as a whole,\n\n\u201cThe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions\n1\ntaken to overcome his problems, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use\n(if an alcohol abuser)\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.23(b).\n4\ndoes not provide a reasonable basis for the Judge\u2019s finding of falsification.  However, this error is\nultimately harmless in that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Guideline G are sustainable.\nWith regard to Guideline G, Applicant argues that the Judge should have found Applicant\u2019s\nconduct mitigated.  Applicant cites two Hearing Office decisions in other cases he considers similar\nto his in which the Hearing Office Judges granted clearances.  Applicant argues that the Judge should\nhave applied Mitigating Condition (MC) 23(b).  \n1\n Applicant\u2019s reliance on the two other Hearing Office decisions is misplaced.  Hearing Office\ndecisions in other cases constitute authority, but are not binding on the Board or on Hearing Office\nJudges in other cases.  They are not indicative of error on the part of Hearing Office Judges in other\ndecisions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-15003 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2005). \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 05-05439 at 2 (App. Bd. May 29, 2007).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance.  As the trier of\nfact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence\noutweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge properly considered the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s\nalcohol consumption.  He reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct.  The Judge considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and explained why their application was not warranted.  He cited such factors as\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol until 2005, a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, his continued drinking\nafter a December 2004 DUI arrest and after his participation in alcohol rehabilitation programs in\n2004 and 2005, his removal from the 2004 outpatient program when he came to a session with\nalcohol on his breath, his conflicting statements about his completion of the AA 12-step program,\nand his lack of clarity about when he became abstinent.  These factors, upon which the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that the mitigating factors did not apply is based, are supported by substantial record\nevidence.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline G is sustainable.\n\n5\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\n \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Applicant is a structural mechanic for a defense contractor.  He voluntarily entered an\nalcohol rehabilitation program in 2004, but did not complete the out-patient program because he had\nalcohol odor on his breath one day at a session.  Subsequently, he drove while drunk with a blood\nalcohol content of .24%.  He failed to disclose a mental detention warrant and transport to a state\nhospital for psychiatric evaluation.  Applicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption and personal\nconduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On September 26, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive\u2019s Revised Guidelines\nimplemented September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 16, 2006,\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on\nFebruary 27, 2007.  On April 4, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The\nGovernment and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 16, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 44 years old, married though separated from his wife, and has a 12-year-old son.\nApplicant works for a defense contractor as an structural aircraft mechanic.  Formerly, he worked\nfor a pharmaceutical company as a sales representative.  He resigned that position in March 2005\nto become an aircraft mechanic and to reduce his stress.  He is an Army veteran. (Tr. 17, 23, 24, 34-\n36; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant consumed alcohol to excess and to intoxication from time to time from 1978 until\nat least October 25, 2005.  In 1978 Applicant was 15 years old.  From that point until April 2006,\nhe  consumed it less frequently.  He admitted in his November 2006, Answer that he had one or two\ndrinks per year.  He now claims he does not drink alcohol. (Tr. 20, 35-37, 46-48; Answer)\nApplicant was arrested in March 1982, at the age of 19, for being drunk in public and\nresisting arrest.  He was found guilty and sentenced to 100 hours of community service.  His next\narrest involving alcohol was in February 1987, when the charge was disorderly intoxication.  He was\nfound guilty and fined $100.  In November 2004, while on a family trip with relatives, his 14 year\nold niece accused him of inappropriately touching her breast.  Applicant claims he was asleep in the\nsecond row of the minivan seating on the right side.  His niece was asleep leaning against his left\nside.  Another person was asleep on the niece\u2019s left side.  Applicant\u2019s left arm was around his niece\u2019s\nshoulder and his hand touched her breast.  He denies touching her on her breast because he had been\ndrinking with the other family members at a family party, and was asleep on the way home in the car.\nThe family members did not inform the police authorities and no criminal action was taken against\nApplicant.  Next, on December 12, 2004, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DUI)\nwith a blood alcohol content of .24%.  He pled guilty and was sentenced to four days in jail, and\n\n4\nordered to pay $660.50 in fines and court costs.  He had his driving privileges suspended for 45 days\nand was ordered to attend an alcohol and drug education course.  He completed the course and\nregained his driving privileges. (Tr. 15-17, 27, 38, 39, 51-53, 59; Exhibits 1, 2, B)\nApplicant attended voluntarily an in-patient detoxification program from June 17, 2004, to\nJune 22, 2004.  He then transferred to an out-patient program and went to Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA).  He was removed from that program by the counselors because he came to a session on August\n5, 2004, with the odor of alcohol on his breath.  He had been drinking, but denies being intoxicated.\nThe program discharged him on August 12, 2004, when he refused to sign a relapse agreement,\nwhich would have required him to participate in a 30-day in-patient program because of his alcohol\nuse during the out-patient program.  Applicant did not complete the out-patient program because he\nfound his church group and AA sessions more effective for him.  They were focused on alcohol\nproblems, whereas Applicant thought the drug users in the out-patient program decreased his sense\nof value in that program.  Applicant did not produce any documentation related to his prognosis\nregarding his alcohol problem, or his participation in the in-patient program. (Tr. 18-21, 26, 29-33,\n40-51, 59; Answer)\nOn September 2, 2004, the county sheriff served on Applicant a mental detention warrant and\ntook him to a state mental hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.  Applicant did not understand that\nhe was arrested by the sheriff when served with the warrant.  The sheriff\u2019s deputy transported him\nto and from the state hospital for the consultation the same day.  He did not disclose that incident on\nhis July 12, 2005, electronic security questionnaire (SCA), Question 21 (Mental Record; mental\nhealth consultations in the past seven years).  Applicant disclosed his January 2005, to March 2005,\nevaluations , and also disclosed his June 2004, alcohol rehabilitation in the \u201cadditional comments\u201d\nsection of the SCA.  He claims it \u201cslipped his mind\u201d to list the September 2004 visit.  Applicant told\nthe physician who interviewed him that his wife complained to the police that he would hurt himself\nafter having a dispute with her.  He denied to the physician that he would take such action.  The\nphysician recommended an increase in his medication and made an initial prognosis of an adjustment\ndisorder with a follow up for mental therapy.  Applicant also consulted with a clinical psychologist\nfrom December 2004, to February 2005, who diagnosed Applicant as having alcohol dependence.\nApplicant considers himself an alcoholic, recognizes alcoholism is a disease, and knows he should\nnot consume alcohol if he wants to participate in his son\u2019s upbringing. (Tr. 18-21, 26, 29-33, 35, 36,\n44, 54-58; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant claimed that in AA he had a sponsor, \u201cwent through the 12 step program, about\neight months.\u201d  Then Applicant testified he did not complete all 12 steps, and he does not think a\nperson in the AA program has to complete all 12 steps in order.  He could not recite the AA 12 steps.\nIf Applicant feels he has the urge to drink alcohol, he claims he goes to AA for support.  He does not\ndo anything else to maintain his sobriety.  When he continued to drink alcohol after his arrests and\nparticipation in the rehabilitation programs, he would drink \u201coff and on\u201d, which he described as not\ndrinking for two weeks and then drinking five or six beers on a weekend.  The 2004 court-imposed\npost-DUI alcohol education program required Applicant to maintain sobriety during in the aftercare\nprogram as part of his effort to regain his driving privileges.  Applicant signed the after-care program\nsheet in May 2005.  Applicant did not comply with those recommendations. (Tr. 18, 46-50, 59;\nExhibit B)\nPOLICIES\n\n5\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\n\n6\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption: The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often\nleads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Para. 21\nGuideline E:Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. Para. 15\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions each of the\nallegations in the SOR.  Applicant has the burden of proof and persuasion that the Mitigating\nConditions in each guideline should apply.  His credibility is also an issue in his explanations of why\nhe failed to disclose his September 2004, mandatory consultation with a state physician, and his\nclaimed abstinence and treatment program participation.  Any doubt must be resolved against\nApplicant and in favor of the national security.\nAlcohol Consumption: Disqualifying Conditions (DC) are those that raise a security concern.\nApplicant has a history of alcohol consumption, with three incidents between 1982 and 2004, plus\nthe inappropriate touching incident with his niece.  The December 2004, DUI occurred after he\nvoluntarily admitted himself to in-patient and out-patient treatment programs, demonstrating he did\nnot change his behavior after those programs.  DC 22 (a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence), DC 22 (c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to\nthe point of impaired judgment, regardless of any diagnosis of alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependence), DC 22 (e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical\nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program), and DC 22 (f)\n(relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram) apply.  Applying these DC to the facts, I conclude Applicant has several alcohol-related\nincidents away from work.  He admitted he drank to excess and to the point of intoxication from\n1978 to October 2005, constituting habitual consumption of alcohol.  Applicant admitted his\ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence as alleged in the SOR, and then admitted at the hearing he\n\n7\nconsidered himself an alcoholic.  Yet he continued to drink alcohol after his DUI arrest and his\nparticipation in the 2004 and 2005 alcohol rehabilitation programs.  Therefore, all the DC criteria\nare met.\nHis purported abstinence, if true, has not been of sufficient duration to support his claim of\nabstinence.  Furthermore, his credibility is diminished substantially by his conflicting statements\nabout his completion of the AA 12-step program.  His credibility about his commitment to\nabstinence is also diminished by his removal from the outpatient program in 2004 when he came to\na session with alcohol on his breath, along with his lack of clarity as to when he became abstinent.\nHe has made too many conflicting statements, thereby raising substantial doubts.  Those doubts are\nresolved in favor of national security and against Applicant.  He demonstrated repeatedly that he\ndoes not have control over alcohol.  I do not believe his explanations about his abstinence\nmaintenance attempts,\nBased on the totality of the evidence, I conclude no Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply.\nApplicant has not persuaded me that he recognizes his alcohol problem significantly enough to\nbecome and remain abstinent, or that he meets any of the MC criteria.  The burden of proof is on\nhim, and he did not meet it.\nPersonal Conduct: The next issue is whether he deliberately falsified his answer to Question\n21 on his SCA by failing to disclose the September 2, 2004, mental detention warrant and his\nconsultation with the state physician.  He did not disclose the consultation with the physician at the\nstate hospital, and had no persuasive explanation why he did not disclose it when it occurred in the\nmidst of his other rehabilitation programs and later DUI arrest.  DC 16 (a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personal security questionnaire used to\nconduct investigations or determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness) applies\nNone of the MC in Paragraph 17 under this guideline apply.  Considering the first three MC,\nApplicant did not correct the admission before being confronted with the facts, he did not get bad\nadvice from legal counsel not to disclose it, nor was the offense minor and unlikely to recur based\non Applicant\u2019s problems with alcohol.  None of the remaining four MC apply on their facts.  I am\nnot persuaded by Applicant\u2019s explanation that he did not deliberately fail to disclose this incident.\n\u201cWhole Person Concept\u201d: Applicant\u2019s alcohol incidents are serious events and show a\npattern of alcohol abuse.  His DUI occurred at age 41, so he was mature enough to know what he\nwas doing, particularly after he had attended an alcohol rehabilitation program voluntarily.  There\nis little or no evidence of rehabilitation except his self-serving statement that he does not drink\nanymore.  He did not submit any objective or professional information to support his assertions.\nGiven his purported recognition of his alcohol problem, and the absence of participation in an\nongoing program for maintaining sobriety, there is a strong likelihood that he will resume the\nconsumption of alcohol.  He has not presented any persuasive evidence that he has taken\npreventative or therapeutic measures to protect himself from his past problems.\nFurthermore, the areas of concern about Applicant are whether he actually completed any part\nof the AA 12-step program, and when he became abstinent, if at all.  He continued to drink alcohol\nafter his rehabilitation programs ended with recommendations he not drink alcohol, and what is his\nprognosis and how he addresses the recommendations.  His DUI blood alcohol content of .24% is\n\n8\nabout three times greater than the minimum intoxication level allowed by law, so Applicant had a\nhigher tolerance for alcohol than he me to believe he now had at the hearing. \nTherefore, I do not find Applicant is credible, persuasive, or has met his burden of proof.

Ambrose, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 23 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor.  He and a friend\ncreated at least four counterfeit county fair tickets in 2004.  He pled guilty to attempted forgery in\n\n2\n2006, after he completed his security clearance application.  Applicant mitigated the criminal\nconduct and personal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 4, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.  Applicant answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 20, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2007.  With the consent of the parties, I convened\na hearing on June 7, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nJune 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 23 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor.  He started working\nfor the defense contractor on September 12, 2005, after graduating from junior college.  He\ncompleted a security clearance application (SCA) on that date.  Question 23 (Your Police Record)\nin subsection Question 23.f. inquires if Applicant had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted\nof any offenses not listed in the other subsections of Question 23.  Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d (Tr. 51,\n52; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant and a friend with whom he no longer associates prepared several counterfeit county\nfair tickets in August 2004.  The county fair board raised prices, and Applicant did not have much\nmoney then, so he and his friend used Applicant\u2019s computer to prepare the tickets.  Applicant\nattempted to sell one ticket for $5.00, but it was to a sheriff\u2019s office undercover operative.  Applicant\nthought if he were caught making any sale, he would be warned and told to stop doing it.  He thought\nof himself then as being young and stupid. (Tr. 18, 19, 39, 49)\nApplicant voluntarily went to the sheriff\u2019s office in his county on August 14, 2004, to answer\nquestions.  He was not arrested.  The sheriff\u2019s investigator told him he was not under arrest.  The\nsheriff\u2019s jail division records show Applicant has not been arrested in that county nor was he ever\nincarcerated there.  Applicant thought when he heard nothing from the sheriff or local prosecutor\nafter August 2004, that he was \u201chome free.\u201d  The court clerk\u2019s office found no felony record in the\ncourt records pertaining to Applicant. (Tr. 20, 21, 33, 37, 44; Exhibit A)\n\n3\nAfter speaking to that investigator, Applicant returned home and never heard from the sheriff\nor local prosecutor until December 2005.  His attorney originally told Applicant to continue with his\nlife and he would contact Applicant if there were any developments in the case.  In December 2005,\nthe local prosecutor contacted Applicant\u2019s attorney to resolve the case before the end of 2005.  The\nattorney did not agree with that request.  The prosecutor issued a misdemeanor complaint for\nattempted forgery, a misdemeanor of the first degree under state law.  On July 11, 2006, Applicant\npled guilty to the attempted forgery.  The state court judge fined him $500 plus court costs of $83.74.\nApplicant paid that amount.  Applicant also received a suspended jail sentence of 180 days, 100\nhours of community service, forfeiture of his 2004 computer equipment the sheriff seized in August\n2004, ordered to remain out of trouble for one year, and was further ordered to cooperate with the\nsheriff and prosecutor on any investigation and prosecution involving the counterfeit fair tickets.\nOn July 16, 2006, the state court reduced the community service time to 60 hours to be equal to what\nhis friend received in his sentence.  Applicant completed the community service successfully.  He\nworked at the county fairgrounds picking up trash.  The \u201ctraffic docket\u201d for July 11, 2006, shows a\nconviction for forgery, but the actual court findings shows the offense was \u201cattempted forgery,\u201d a\nmisdemeanor. (Tr. 22-28; Exhibits 2, A-C, F)\nApplicant spoke with a Government investigator about his SCA before June 2006.  The\ninvestigator spoke with him once, and then returned after she had talked to his neighbors and was\ntold about the counterfeit county fair tickets.  He disclosed everything to her that had happened up\nto that time, which was before he had been charged in the misdemeanor complaint.  Page 2 of the\nSCA, under \u201cYour Personal Interview,\u201d states the interview allows the Applicant the opportunity to\n\u201cupdate, clarify, and explain information on your form more completely . . .\u201d  Applicant updated and\nclarified his situation regarding this incident for which he had not been charged until June 13, 2006.\n(Tr. 42, 50; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant received acceptable ratings on his first employee evaluation from December 2004\nto December 2005.  In the January to December 2006 evaluation he increased his ratings in five of\neight categories to the \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d rating.  His supervisor considers Applicant competent,\ntrustworthy, a fast learner, not a disciplinary problem, and a good team player. (Tr. 54-63; Exhibits\nD, E)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\n\n4\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In\nevaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the\nadjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and\nthe Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\n\n5\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \u00b630\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \u00b615\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct  Applicant and his friend counterfeited county fair tickets\nin 2004.  Applicant had four tickets, and tried to sell only one of them.  The county sheriff caught\nhim immediately.  Applicant\u2019s actions were a single serious crime (\u00b6 31.a), and involve allegations\nor admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted (\u00b6 31.c).  Applicant had a one year probation expiring July 11, 2007, which\nhe was currently serving at the time of the hearing in June 2007. (\u00b6 31.d).  These are the\nDisqualifying Conditions that apply to these facts.\nHowever, the SOR alleges Applicant was arrested on August 2, 2004, but the evidence shows\nhe was never arrested then or ever for this violation of state law.  The SOR also alleges Applicant\n\u201cfaced Fourth Degree Felony-Forgery charges\u201d, but the evidence shows he only faced a misdemeanor\ncharge in June 2006.\nThe Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable are that \u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened that it is unlikely to recur and it does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d (\u00b6 32.a), and \u2018there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation, including but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, remorse or restitution, higher education, or a good employment record\u201d(\u00b6 32.d).  Applicant\nwas 19 years old when he made the tickets with a friend.  He is now three years older, married, and\nhas responsible employment.  His performance evaluations from his supervisor are very good, and\nthe supervisor finds him to be a valuable employee.  This incident was a one time occurrence that\nwas stopped by the local sheriff that will not recur because Applicant is now gainfully employed, as\nis his wife, so they can afford tickets to the county fair.  He does not associate with the friend\ninvolved with him in the incident.  \nApplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time was that this counterfeit ticket production was harmless\nand he would be told to stop by the authorities of caught.  The minimal cost of each ticket, and his\nlack of success in selling the four he had, made him think it was a truly minor offense, if any at all.\nApplicant admitted he was young, poor, and foolish at the time.  He also thought that nothing would\nhappen from it because after his August 2004, discussion with the sheriff\u2019s office, he heard nothing\nagain from any law enforcement official.  Neither he nor his attorney heard anything until December\n\n6\n2005.  He thought it had gone away and he was \u201chome free.\u201d  He later discovered he was wrong, and\nhis actions resulted in a misdemeanor conviction.\nThis incident was not disclosed on his SCA, but Applicant had not been arrested nor charged\nfor the offense until nine months after he completed his SCA.  In addition, he fully disclosed the\nincident to the Government investigator before June 2006.  There was not a knowing and willful\nmaking of a false statement to a government agency.  No felony under 18 U.S.C. 1001 was\ncommitted.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct  Applicant did not disclose in SCA Question 23.f. that he\nhad been arrested, charged, or convicted of the counterfeit county fair offense.  That non-disclosure\nwas accurate because the county records show he was never arrested for that offense, was not\ncharged with any offense until June 13, 2006, nine months after the September 12, 2005, completion\nof the SCA, and was not convicted of a misdemeanor attempted forgery until July 11, 2006.\nTherefore, his answer was accurate and not a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification on\nthe SCA under Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 16.a.  The adverse information on this incident does\nnot meet the criteria of DC \u00b6 16.c. because there is only one adjudicative issue area, criminal\nconduct, involved.  Nor does DC \u00b6 16.d. or the following DCs apply on the facts or their criteria. \nApplicant disclosed to the Government investigator the facts involved in this incident,\nthereby making an update of his original SCA.  Mitigating Condition (MC) \u00b6 17.c. would apply\nbecause the one-timeoffense was minor, it happened three years ago, it is unlikely to recur, and the\nunique circumstances were Applicant\u2019s lack of maturity, minimal finances, increased fair ticket cost\noccurring at that time, and Applicant succumbing to his friends suggestion.  That friend is no longer\nin Applicant\u2019s circle.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nUnder this concept, I considered the one-time and minor nature of this offense.  The local\nprosecutor thought it only warranted a misdemeanor charge nearly two years later.  Applicant is\ngainfully employed and married now, no longer without income to buy fair tickets and not subject\nto the importuning of his friend.  Applicant was three years younger then.  There is no likelihood of\nrecurrence of this incident.  He served his probation conditions successfully.  The month remaining\non his probation term is not significant.  Considering all the evidence, this incident was obviously\na stupid and youthful action that Applicant now regrets.\n\n7\nTherefore, I conclude the criminal conduct security concern for Applicant.  I conclude the\npersonal conduct security concern for Applicant.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d for\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, particularly considering Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 31-year-old information technology senior auditor working for a defense contractor. In 1997, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in management of information systems. He completed his masters in business administration GE 3 and GE 6-8 (respectively). 3 (marketing) in October 2006 (Tr. 5, GE 1). He married his spouse in 2005, and they have a baby born in March 2007 (Tr. 54). From 1993 to 1997, Applicant attended college and worked part-time for a government agency where he held a security clearance. Since 1998, he has been continuously employed by four different employers, including three government contractors (GE 1). In 2002, while working for a government contractor (not his current employer), he submitted a security clearance application and underwent a background interview with a government investigator. During that interview, Applicant was confronted about his financial problems and made aware of the government\u2019s financial considerations concerns (GE 5). In December 2004, he was hired by his current employer, a government contractor. He requires access to classified information to retain his job. On May 3",

As of the date of the hearing, he had 11 accounts, owing\napproximately $29,400, which had been delinquent for many years. His evidence is\ninsufficient to show that he is in control of his finances, is not overextended, and has\na track record of financial responsibility. More importantly, he failed to disclose his\ndebts and a lien in his security clearance application. Clearance is denied\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 31, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF\n86). On April 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging facts and security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The\nSOR informed Applicant that based on information available to the Government,\nDOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified\ninformation and submitted the case to an administrative judge for a security\nclearance determination.  On May 7, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer),\n1\nand requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 24, 2007. On May 29, 2007, a Notice of\n \nHearing was issued convening a hearing on June 21, 2007. The hearing was\nconvened as scheduled. The government presented eight exhibits, marked GE 1-8, to\nsupport the SOR. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented 10 exhibits,\nmarked AE 1-10.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 3, 2007.\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m with explanations.\nHe denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g-1.i, 1.l, and 2.a-2.c. His admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, particularly\nconsidering Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is a 31-year-old information technology senior auditor working for\na defense contractor. In 1997, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in management of\ninformation systems. He completed his masters in business administration\n\n  GE 3 and GE 6-8 (respectively).\n3\n(marketing) in October 2006 (Tr. 5, GE 1). He married his spouse in 2005, and they\nhave a baby born in March 2007 (Tr. 54). \nFrom 1993 to 1997, Applicant attended college and worked part-time for a\ngovernment agency where he held a security clearance. Since 1998, he has been\ncontinuously employed by four different employers, including three government\ncontractors (GE 1). In 2002, while working for a government contractor (not his\ncurrent employer), he submitted a security clearance application and underwent a\nbackground interview with a government investigator. During that interview,\nApplicant was confronted about his financial problems and made aware of the\ngovernment\u2019s financial considerations concerns (GE 5). In December 2004, he was\nhired by his current employer, a government contractor. He requires access to\nclassified information to retain his job.\nOn May 31, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (GE\n1). In response to question 36 (asking whether in the last seven years he had a lien\nplaced against him), he answered \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose a $3,239 state tax lien\nfiled against him in 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nApplicant explained he believed the state had lifted the lien. He called the\nstate\u2019s collections department in 2002, and told them he had changed employers. He\nclaimed he was informed the lien would be lifted and that the debt would be\ncollected by garnishing his federal income tax returns. AE 11 shows Applicant paid\nthe $3,239 he owed; there is no information to corroborate when the payment was\nmade. Applicant still owes $129 to the state resulting from penalties he did not know\nabout until May 2007 (Tr. 34-35). \nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 38 and 39 (asking whether in the last seven\nyears he had been 180 days delinquent on any debts, and whether he was currently 90\ndays delinquent on any debts (respectively)). He failed to disclose, however, the\ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, and 1.h through 1.l. Applicant explained he\ndid not disclose the delinquent debts because he believed there were mistakes in the\naccounts and he did not want to admit something he was not certain about (Tr. 63). \nApplicant averred that he never intended to falsify or mislead the government.\nIn his response to question 43 of the security clearance application, he stated that in\n2002 during a prior background investigation, he provided a government investigator\nwith the details of his financial history, and offered to make his 2002 statement\navailable (GE 5). \nApplicant\u2019s current background investigation addressed his financial situation\nand included the review of credit bureau reports (CBRs) from April 2002, September\n2005, September 2006, and March 2007.  Consistent with his 2002 statement,\n3\nApplicant testified his financial problems started around 1998 when he was a\n\n  AE  5 shows Ap plicant paid $1 26  in June 200 7.

In 1998, he was involved in an\naccident and totaled the car. After the insurance settlement, he still had a $10,872\ndeficiency on his car loan, no means of transportation, and many other financial\nobligations. Following his attorney\u2019s advice, he filed for bankruptcy protection.\nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy documents show that in 1998 he was discharged of\n$28,917 in liabilities. He had assets totaling $3,445 (GE 2).\nIn 1998, within months of his bankruptcy discharge, Applicant purchased a\n1996 car, and acquired a $31,000 car note. In January 2001, Applicant was involved\nin another car accident and totaled the car. The vehicle was not insured, and\nApplicant acquired the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. In June 2004, the creditor obtained\na $16,475 judgment against Applicant, along with 9% interest accruing from May\n2001, and $1,500 in attorney\u2019s fees (AE 8). In 2004, Applicant offered the creditor\nto pay .05 cents on the dollar to settle the debt. He received no response. Other than\nmaking this offer, Applicant has made no effort to pay or resolve this debt since\n2001. \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent/charged off accounts owing approximately\n$32,578. Except for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, owing $3,239, and SOR \u00b6 1.i,\nowing $26,476, the remainder 10 delinquencies could be considered small debts (for\nless than $1,000 each), and they total $2,863. Many of these debts have been\ndelinquent since 2000-2003. Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant established he paid all\nthe debt, except for $129 (AE 11). There is no evidence as to when the account was\npaid. \nThe debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.j, were paid on July 5, 2007 (AE 11).\nApplicant acknowledged that the following debts are still outstanding, \u00b6\u00b6 1.c,  1.e,\n4\n1.i, 1.k, and 1.l.  He has not paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.h. He\n5\nexplained that he does not recognize the creditors, and wants to verify the debts\nbefore he begins budgeting to pay for them. \nApplicant claimed mitigating circumstances that prevented him from paying\nhis debts, i.e., the two car accidents, and deaths and illnesses in his family that\nrequired him to provide financial assistance to his relatives. He presented no\nevidence, other than his testimony, to corroborate his claims of circumstances\nbeyond his control, to show how his family medical problems affected his financial\nsituation, and the extent of the financial support he provided.\n\n  Directive, Section 6.3. \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination\n6\nbased upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy\nin enclosure 2 . . .\u201d\nIn 2006, Applicant retained the services of the Lexington Law Firm to assist\nhim to verify/dispute some of the debts reflected in his CBRs. The Lexington Law\nFirm however, did not provide him with financial counseling. They merely assisted\nhim to verify and contest some of CBR entries. Other than retaining the Lexington\nLaw Firm for a period of time during 2006, Applicant presented no evidence of any\ncounseling or other measures he has taken to avoid future financial difficulties.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is employed. He and his wife clear approximately $7,000 a\nmonth. After paying their living expenses and current debts, they have a $1,500\nremainder. Applicant claimed his wife contributes to the household finances, helps\nhim to pay his debts, and prepares the family financial budget. He provided no\nevidence to corroborate any of these claims. Applicant claimed he has been placing a\nlot of effort to resolve his financial situation and that he is making strides. He\nprovided little or no evidence to show or corroborate the progress he has made to\nresolve his financial problems since 2002. \nApplicant and his wife bought a home sometime after 2005; their mortgage\npayment is $2,500 a month (Tr. 77). They bought the home in her name because of\nhis credit rating. Applicant owns a 1997 Infinity QX4 SUV. His wife\u2019s car is a 2005\nAcura MDX. Applicant carries four credit cards with low credit. He stated he is\nusing the credit cards to reestablish his credit. Applicant owes a substantial amount\nof debt in student loans. Payments on his student loans are deferred until March\n2008 (Tr. 94).\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost\nare the Disqualifying and Mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are\nnot viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common\nsense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the\n6\n\n  Directive \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\n7\nwhole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nshould be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d\n  See Department of the Navy v.

Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I\n7\nconclude Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) are the applicable relevant adjudicative guidelines.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the initial burden of proving\n8\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must\nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.  The responsibility then shifts\n9\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of\npersuasion.  \n10\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.11\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd.\n12\nMay 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the government\u2019s concern is\nthat an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18.\nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back\nto the late 1990s. In 1998, he filed for bankruptcy protection and was discharged of\n$28,917 in debt. Since 1998, he accumulated at least 12 delinquent/charged off debts\nand/or judgments totaling approximately $32,578. Except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.i, all of\nthe delinquent accounts could be considered small debts (for less than $1,000);\nhowever, many have been delinquent for many years. \nIn 2002, Applicant was confronted about his financial problems by a\ngovernment investigator and indicated he would make efforts to resolve his debts.\nHe presented little evidence to show he took any action to resolve his debts prior to\nhis receipt of the SOR. SOR \u00b6 1.a was collected by the state garnishing his federal\nincome tax return, and he still owes $129. As of the hearing date, he was still\ncarrying the same 11 outstanding delinquent/charged off debts alleged in the SOR.\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial\nobligations; apply in this case. \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,  I conclude that none of the\n12\nmitigating conditions apply. In 2006, Applicant retained the services of the\nLexington Law Firm efforts to verify/dispute some of his debts. He paid four debts\nafter receipt of the SOR; one three days before his hearing, the other three on July 5,\n2007. Notwithstanding, his recent efforts to resolve his debts fall short of showing\ngood faith efforts to resolve his delinquencies, or that Applicant has a track record\nof financial responsibility. \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC)\n\u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances, and conclude it applies, but only to a limited\nextent. \nApplicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony fails to establish mitigating factors that\nmay be considered as circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability\nto pay his debts. He was involved in two car accidents, and immediate family\nmembers passed away and/or suffered illnesses which required Applicant to provide\nthem with financial assistance. These claims demonstrate circumstances beyond his\n\ncontrol however, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt\nresponsibly with his financial obligations. His financial problems appear to be the\nresult of his spending beyond his means and poor financial management/judgment.\nHe presented little evidence to show he dealt responsibly with his financial\nobligations before, or after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements,\ndocumented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial assistance/counseling).\nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a\nfinding that he has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he\nhas taken control of his financial situation. Therefore, his financial problems are\nlikely to be a concern in the future. Moreover, his financial problems are recent, not\nisolated, and ongoing. \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG & 15.\nThe government\u2019s evidence established Applicant failed to disclose relevant\ninformation in his answers to questions 36, 38, and 39 of his security clearance\napplication. Considering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant\ndeliberately failed to disclose the information. Numerous factors weighed in my\nanalysis to reach that conclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his level of education,\nhis employment history, his demeanor and testimony, the number and amount of his\ndebts, his long term disregard of the debts, his experience with the security clearance\napplication process, and the lack of credibility of his excuses. He knew the\nimportance of accurate completion of his security clearance application, and\nnevertheless failed to provide information that was material to making an informed\nsecurity decision. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire . . ., and DC \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct or concealment of information\nabout one=s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress . . ., apply.\nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (MC) and\nconclude that none apply. Applicant=s falsification is recent, and his favorable\ninformation is not sufficient to apply any of the MCs. Additionally, for the same\nreasons outlined under the discussions of Guideline F, incorporated herein, I\nconclude Applicant=s behavior shows questionable judgment, lack of reliability, and\nuntrustworthiness. \nApplicant=s recent falsification brings to the forefront the financial\nconsiderations concerns raised by his behavior. I am required to consider Applicant=s\n\n  ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 ( App. Bd. May 19, 2006).\n13\noverall questionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged\nin the SOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his behavior is recent;\nthe likelihood of recurrence; Applicant=s explanations concerning the circumstances\nof the incidents alleged; and his rehabilitation.13\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I\napplied the whole person concept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s age,\neducation, maturity, his years working for defense contractors, and his demeanor and\ntestimony. Considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances, he demonstrated a\nlack of judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial affairs.\nFurthermore, his falsifications raise serious security concerns regarding his honesty\nand willingness to comply with rules and regulations. He has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised by his overall behavior. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, & 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.e, 1.h,\n   1.i, 1.k-1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

Subject explained that he had just returned from\na business trip . . . and had subsequently consumed a 12 pack of 12 OZ\nbeers while watching a football game, when he lost control. When the\nteam he followed lost, subject became upset. Subject related that he did\nnot have exact recall of the incident or sequence of events, but he did\nadmit to having slapped his young daughter, having pushed and slapped\nhis wife on the top of the head, having thrown household items, having\npunched a hole in the wall and having broken a drawer, while inside the\ncondo. Subject conveyed that the verbal and physical abuse towards his\nwife continued outside the condo, when a neighbor witnessed the incident,\nhe immediately contacted the police. Subject related when the . . . police\narrived, he walked out the back door of his condo and hid in a densely\nwooded area behind the condominium complex . . . . Sometime later that\nevening subject returned to the condo where the arresting officers awaited\nand took him into custody. . . . Subject stated that the charges against him\nwere eventually nolled in DEC 03 because his spouse did not want to\npursue further criminal action against him.\nAlthough the charges were dropped, applicant spent about a week in custody\nfollowing his arrest and missed about two weeks of work due to the incident.\nFollowing this last incident, applicant began treatment with a psychotherapist who\ndescribes himself as a \u201cDoctor of Addictive Disorders.\u201d In an October 2007 letter, the\npsychotherapist stated (1) applicant was under his clinical care from 10/25/2003 through\n12/15/2003, (2) applicant\u2019s diagnosis is \u201cAlcohol Dependence Disorder,\u201d and (3) in spite\nof applicant\u2019s diagnosis, he should not be of any concern as long as he remains sober\n[and] attends AA meetings regularly.\u201d \n\n3\nApplicant abstained from the use of alcohol for three to four months following the\n2003 incident. However, he eventually resumed its use, and continues to consume it\ntoday. He states, however, that he has not consumed it to the point of intoxication since\nthe October 2003 incident (Exhibit 8).\nApplicant attended AA meetings from the time of his arrest until February 2004.\nHe stopped attending AA in February 2004 because he felt it didn\u2019t help. Although he\nadmits to previously perceiving himself as having an alcohol problem, he does not\nbelieve he currently has such a problem.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in Paragraph 21 of the\nAG, and is as follows:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise a security concern. Under\nParagraph 22.a., \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 22.c., \u201chabitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 22.d., \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional\n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s history of consuming alcohol to excess\nand involvement in alcohol-related incidents requires application of the first two\ndisqualifying conditions. The fact he was diagnosed with \u201calcohol dependence disorder\u201d\nby his psychotherapist requires application of the last disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 23 of the AG sets out potentially mitigating conditions. Under\nParagraph 23.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Although it has been over four years since applicant\u2019s last alcohol-\nrelated incident, given his long history of alcohol abuse, his unwillingness to participate\nin an AA type program (as his psychotherapist recommended), and his continued\nconsumption of alcohol, I cannot conclude a recurrence of his alcohol-related poor\njudgment is unlikely. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is not applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\n\n5\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although applicant began abusing\nalcohol while a teenager, he continued to abuse it well into adulthood. The October\n2003 incident should have been a wake up call for him, and for a short period of time he\nacted as though it was. By abstaining from the use of alcohol, seeking counseling and\nregularly attending AA, applicant seemed to have acknowledged he had a serious\nproblem that needed a serious solution. However, shortly after the charges against him\nwere dropped, he stopped attending counseling and AA, and resumed drinking. In light\nof his alcohol dependence diagnosis, this conduct precludes a finding that future\nalcohol-related incidents are unlikely. For this reason, Guideline G is found against\napplicant.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On March 30, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  The SOR was subsequently amended to add allegations\nunder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  On December 31, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Roger C. Wesley granted Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Department\nCounsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ntrustworthiness determination is sustainable.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact:  Applicant is a 40-year-old office assistant\nfor a defense contractor.  She has approximately two years of college training and has worked for\nher current employer since September 2004, save for an extended period of disability that included\nmultiple hospital admissions.  She estimates to have received disability payments of around 50 per\ncent of her salary while out of work on disability in 2007.  \nSince 2000, Applicant has accumulated a number of debts,  most of them health-related.  She\nhas encountered difficulties in tracking down some of the medical debts with credit reporting\nagencies and medical providers and cannot identify them by name.  One of her larger medical bills\nis the $9,362.00 hospital debt at SOR paragraph 1(b).  Believing this hospital debt was covered by\ninsurance, she has not been able to make any headway in eliciting debt details with the collection\nagency holding this debt.  Her most recent e-mail and telephone exchanges with the creditor have\nyielded no results, and the status of this debt remains unclear.  Considering that she was employed\nby this hospital at the time of her hospitalization, her understanding that her hospital stay was\ninsurance covered is plausible.  Her dispute of this debt is entitled to an inference of good faith\nquestioning of the debt.  \nApplicant questions two of the other medical debts listed in the SOR.  They are relatively\nsmall in amounts and may very well represent missed co-pays.  She has had no success in obtaining\n\n3\nfinancial information from these listed creditors with health-related debts. Without information about\nthese debts, she cannot affirm whether they are legitimate or not.  \nBesides her medical debts, Applicant is indebted to a landlord on an apartment she rented in\n1999 from a co-worker on a month-to-month basis for about two months time.  This landlord\nobtained a judgment against her in October 1999 in the sum of $1,411.00.  Applicant is certain she\npaid some of the judgment in 2001 through a garnishment, but can provide no documentation.  She\nestimates to owe maybe half of the judgment, but has received no correspondence of any kind from\nthe judgment holder.\nApplicant\u2019s largest debt, by far, is a deficiency balance on a car she purchased in 1999 for\nabout $24,000.00.  She made monthly payments of around $500.00 on the car for about six months\nbefore defaulting on her payments.  The car was repossessed in 2001 and reportedly sold at a public\nauction.  After being advised by the creditor of a $17,000.00 deficiency balance, she made payment\narrangements with the creditor and made one payment before suspending payments.  She does not\nknow whether the $16,000.00 figure listed in her credit report is correct or not.  Without more\ninformation about the condition of the car and sale documentation from the lender, it is not possible\nto assess whether or not Applicant was adequately credited by the lender. \nApplicant attributes most of her debts to a rough period between 2000 and 2004 when she\nwas unhappy at work, drinking a lot, and experiencing medical issues requiring hospitalization.  Her\nwork and medical problems were compounded by a January 2000 accident she was involved in while\ndriving a rental car.  She had been drinking prior to her accident, and hit a pole beside the highway.\nAn ambulance arrived at the scene and transported her to a local hospital.  While in the hospital, a\nsheriff\u2019s officer came to the hospital and took a blood sample.  She was subsequently charged with\none count of driving under the influence (DUI) and three counts of endangerment (a class 6 felony).\nIn court, she was convicted of all the charges and sentenced to probation and ordered to pay\n$9,362.00 in restitution for the damage caused to the rental car (not insured) and $2,342.50 in fees.\nApplicant did not initially report to her probation department as ordered by the court, and\nshe was arrested (in March 2004) for failing complete all of the terms of her probation.  At hearing,\nthe court reinstated and extended her probationary period by three years and ordered her to complete\na community service requirement, pay restitution, and attend an alcohol class.  Because of a\nremaining restitution balance in April 2007 (estimated to be about $9,000.00), the court extended\nher probation for an additional three years.  Applicant\u2019s probation officer describes her as compliant\nwith her probation conditions.  She credits her with making restitution payments and maintaining\nfull-time employment and a stable residence.  Applicant currently sends her probation department\nsomething every month on her restitution balance.  She does not know what will happen if, at the\nend of the remaining three years of her probation, she has still not discharged the remaining\nrestitution balance. \nApplicant disputes each of the listed medical debts, which she believes should have been\ndischarged long ago by her medical insurance.  She is barely able to pay her current bills with her\n\n4\ncurrent take home pay (estimated to be around $1,700.00) and living expenses, and is considering\nbankruptcy. \nNot much is known about Applicant\u2019s work performance or trust and confidence in which\nshe is held by her supervisors and coworkers. She did not provide any documentation of her\nperformance evaluations, character references, or achievement certificates. \nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nTo the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings are relevant to the assigned error, they will be\ndiscussed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nAppeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s trustworthiness determination if it is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of  the Directive or other applicable\nfederal law.  See ADP Case No. 06-12901 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2007).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable trustworthiness determination under\nGuideline F should be reversed because it fails to articulate satisfactory explanations for material\n\n5\nconclusions, offers explanations that run contrary to the record evidence, and fails to consider\nimportant aspects of the case.  The Board finds Department Counsel\u2019s arguments persuasive.  \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that she has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006).  All that is required is that an\napplicant demonstrate that she has \u201c . . . established a plan to resolve [her] financial problems and\ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJul. 6, 2006).  The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand her actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of her\noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic.  See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a).  \nIn this case, a review of the record indicates that although the debts in question have been\nin existence for a considerable period of time, Applicant has taken no effective action to resolve\nthem, has no cogent plan to due so, and knows little about their actual status.  The Judge found that\nApplicant \u201c . . .  has not sought financial counseling or initiated constructive steps . . . to discharge\nor otherwise resolve her debts.\u201d  Decision at 7.  With respect to a number of her debts, the Judge\nnoted that Applicant \u201c . . . cannot identify them by name.\u201d  Id. at 3.  As to her $9,362 hospital debt,\nthe Judge found that Applicant \u201c . . . has not been able to make any headway in eliciting debt details\nwith the collection agency\u201d and \u201c[h]er most recent e-mail and telephone exchanges with the creditor\nhave yielded no results, and the status of the debt remains unclear.\u201d Id.  With respect to two other\nmedically-related debts the Judge found Applicant \u201c . . . had no success in obtaining financial\ninformation from [the] listed creditors\u201d and \u201c[w]ithout information about these debts she cannot\naffirm whether they are legitimate or not.\u201d  Id.  As for her largest debt, a deficiency balance on a car\npurchased in 1999, the Judge found that Applicant \u201c . . . does not know whether the $16,000.00\nfigure listed in her credit report is incorrect or not\u201d and \u201c[w]ithout more information about the\ncondition of the car and sale documentation from the lender, it is not possible to assess whether or\nnot Applicant was adequately credited by the lender.\u201d  Id. at 3-4.  With respect to a $1,411 judgment\nobtained by a landlord on an apartment Applicant had rented, the Judge stated that Applicant \u201c . . .\ncan provide no documentation\u201d and that \u201c[s]he estimates to owe maybe half the judgment . . . but\nhas received no correspondence of any kind . . . .\u201d  Id. at 3.\nApplicant had the burden of establishing mitigation of the trustworthiness concerns raised\nby her financial situation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Yet at the hearing she offered no independent\nwitnesses and provided no documented proof which would substantiate the basis for her disputes or\ncorroborate her actions to resolve the established concerns.  Applicant\u2019s only documentary exhibit\nwas a post-hearing submission\u2014a single page e-mail exchange with a creditor that occurred five\ndays after the hearing.\nThe fact that Applicant may be insulated from collection actions with respect to a number\nof her debts due to the running of her state\u2019s statute of limitations is of little mitigative value.  The\nBoard has previously noted that reliance on a statute of limitations does not constitute a good faith\neffort to resolve financial difficulties.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20,\n2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).\n\n6\nMoreover, the record as to Applicant\u2019s current circumstances does not suggest that she has\nsuccessfully put her financial difficulties behind her.  On the contrary, the Judge found that Applicant\n\u201c . . . is barely able to pay her current bills with her current take home pay . . . and living expenses\n. . . and is considering bankruptcy.  Decision at 4.  As a result, the Judge concluded that \u201c . . . she has\nhad difficulty making individual or collective progress . . . on her listed debt.\u201d  Id. at 7.\nFinally, the record is otherwise devoid of evidence to support a favorable assessment of\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness in a whole-person context aside from her financial difficulties.  As to\nthat aspect of the case, the Judge noted in his decision: \u201cNot much is known about Applicant\u2019s work\nperformance or trust and confidence in which she is held by her supervisors and coworkers.  She did\nnot provide any documentation of her performance evaluations, character references, or achievement\ncertificates.\u201d  Id. at 4.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Judge\u2019s decision, and the briefs of the parties, the Board\nconcludes that Department Counsel has met its burden of establishing that the Judge\u2019s overall\nfavorable trustworthiness determination under Guideline F is not sustainable and should be reversed.\nIn light of the forgoing, the Board need not reach the issues raised by Department Counsel as to the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions under Guideline J. \nOrder\n \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable trustworthiness determination is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jean E.

WESLEY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts that stem mostly from a car repossession,\nrestitution that was court-ordered in connection with an alcohol-related conviction, and medical\ndebts associated with a series of hospitalizations in which she had difficulties making the co-pay\nrequirements of her health insurance.  Applicant disputes most of the debts, and all but the judgment\ndebt and ordered restitution appeared to be barred by the controlling statute of limitations in any\ncase.  Applicant establishes both extenuation and mitigation with respect to the financial concerns\nassociated with her debts.  Favorable conclusions are warranted with respect to raised financial and\ncriminal conduct concerns.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of Applicant\neligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a trustworthiness determination clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 17, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on September 20, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on November 1, 2007.  A\nhearing was convened on November 1, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s\napplication for a public trust position.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of eight exhibits.\nApplicant relied on one witness (herself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on\nNovember 9, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nIn July 2007,  Department counsel moved to amend the SOR to add three additional\nallegations under Guideline J.  Specifically, Department counsel requested leave to add allegations\nthat Applicant (a) was arrested for driving under the influence (DuI) and endangerment in January\n2000, for which she was convicted, sentenced to probation, and ordered $9,381.00 in restitution and\n$2,342.50 in fees, (b) was arrested in March 2004 for violating the terms of her probation, for which\nthe court reinstated and extended her probationary period by three years, and ordered her to complete\na community service requirement, pay restitution, and attend an alcohol education class, and \u00a9) is\ncurrently on probation due to her still outstanding restitution. \nApplicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend, and for good cause\nshown, Department Counsel\u2019s amendment motion was granted.   Asked how she wished to plead to\nthe amended allegations, Applicant admitted them. \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts: She is\nalleged to have incurred one judgment for $1,200.00 and 11 delinquent debts altogether, which\nexceed $27,000.00 in total.  \nFor her response to the SOR,  Applicant admitted two of the debt-related allegations (i.e., the\njudgment and deficiency related to an auto repossession), but denied the remaining allegations\nwithout explanations (save for claiming some monies were paid on the listed judgment).  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nApplicant is a 40-year-old office assistant of a defense contractor who seeks a trustworthiness\ndetermination.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated\nherein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant has approximately two years of college training and has worked for her current\nemployer since September 2004 (ex. 1; R.T., at 55), save for an extended period of disability that\nincluded multiple hospital admissions, including three this year alone (R.T., at 59).  She estimates\nto have received disability payments of around 50 per cent of her salary while out of work on\ndisability in 2007 (RT., at 59).  \nSince 2000, Applicant has accumulated a number of debts,  most of them medical-related.\nShe has encountered difficulties in tracking down some of the medical debts with credit reporting\nagencies and medical providers and cannot identify them by name (see ex. 8: R.T., at 31).  One of\nher larger medical bills is the $9,362.00 hospital debt covered by creditor 1.b, with whom she was\nemployed at the time of her hospitalization.  Believing this hospital debt was covered by insurance,\nshe has not been able to make any headway in eliciting debt details with the collection agency\nholding this debt (see ex. A; R.T., at 33-38).  Her most recent e-mail and telephone exchanges with\nthe creditor have yielded no results, and the status of this debt remains unclear.  Considering that she\nwas employed by this hospital at the time of her hospitalization, her understanding that her hospital\nstay was insurance covered I is plausible.  The debt is much too large to attribute solely to a missed\nco-payment.   Her dispute of this debt is at the very least entitled to an inference of good faith\nquestioning of the debt of creditor 1.b.  \nApplicant questions, too the other medical debts listed in the SOR.  They are relatively small\nin amounts and may very well represent missed co-pays.  As with her creditor 1.b debt, she has had\nno success in obtaining financial information from these listed creditors with medically-related debts.\nWithout information about these debts she cannot affirm whether they are legitimate or not.  \n                                                                                                                                              \nBesides her medical debts, Applicant is indebted to a landlord on an apartment she rented in\n1999 from a co-worker on a month-to-month basis for about two months time.  This landlord\n(Creditor 1.a) obtained a judgment against her in October 1999 in the sum of $1,411.00 (R.T., at 56).\nApplicant is certain she paid some of the judgment in 2001 through garnishment while employed for\ncreditor 1.b (ex. 8),  but can provide no documentation (R.T., at 56-57).  She estimates to owe maybe\nhalf of the judgment (R.T.,at  56), but has received no correspondence of any kind from the judgment\nholder.\nApplicant\u2019s largest debt, by far,  is a deficiency balance on a car she purchased in 1999 for\nabout $24,000.00 (R.T., at 45-46).  She made monthly payments of around $500.00 on the car for\nabout six months before defaulting in her payments (see ex. 8).  The car was repossessed in 2001 and\nreportedly sold at public auction.  After being advised by the creditor of a $17,000.00 deficiency\nbalance, she made payment arrangements with the creditor and made one payment before suspending\npayments altogether (ex. 8).  She does not know whether the $16,000.00 figure listed in her credit\nreport is correct or not (R.T., at 47-48).  Without more information about the condition of the car and\nsale documentation from the lender, it is not possible to assess whether or not Applicant was\nadequately credited by the lender. \n\n4\nApplicant attributes most of her debts to a rough period between 2000 and 2004 when she\nwas unhappy at work, drinking a lot, and experiencing medical issues requiring hospitalization (see\nex. 8).  Her work and medical problems were compounded by a January 2000 accident she was\ninvolved in while driving a rental car (R.T., at 62).  She had been drinking prior to her accident, and\nhit a pole beside the highway (see ex. 8).  An ambulance arrived at the scene and transported he to\na local hospital. While in the hospital, a sheriff\u2019s officer came to the hospital and took a blood\nsample (ex. 8).    She was subsequently charged with one count of driving under the influence (DuI)\nand three counts of endangerment (a class 6 felony).  In court, she was convicted of all the charges\nand sentenced to probation and ordered to pay $9,362.00 in restitution for the damage caused to the\nrental car (not insured) and $2,342.50 in fees. \nApplicant did not initially report to her probation department as ordered by the court, and was\nshe was arrested (in March 2004) for failing complete all of the terms of her probation (see exs. 7\nand 8; R.T., at 64-65).  At hearing, the court reinstated and extended her probationary period by three\nyears (i.e., to April 2007) and ordered her to complete a community service requirement, pay\nrestitution, and attend an alcohol class.  Because of a remaining restitution balance in April 2007\n(estimated to be about $9,000.00), the court extended her probation for an additional three years (see\nex. 7; R.T., at 64-65).  Applicant\u2019s probation officer describes her as compliant with her probation\nconditions.  She credits her with making restitution payments and maintaining full-time employment\nand a stable residence (ex. 7).  Applicant currently sends her probation department something every\nmonth on her restitution balance (see ex. 7; R.T., at 66).  She does not know what will happen if at\nthe end of the remaining three years of her probation, she has still not discharged the remaining\nrestitution balance (R.T., at 67). \nApplicant disputes each of the listed medical debts, which she believes should have been\ndischarged long ago by her medical insurance.  She is barely able to pay her current bills with her\ncurrent take home pay (estimated to be around $1,700.00) and living expenses (see exs. 2 and 8;\nR.T., at 60-61), and is considering bankruptcy. \nNot much is known about Applicant\u2019s work performance or trust and confidence in which\nshe is held by her supervisors and coworkers. She did not provide any documentation of her\nperformance evaluations, character references, or achievement certificates. \nPOLICIES\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the Defense Office\nof Hearing and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,\nCommunication and Intelligence (ASDC31), entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA),\nwhich gave DOHA responsibility to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel\nworking on unclassified Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\n\n5\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E2.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable\ncriminal acts.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern.  Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's application for a trustworthiness determination may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position depends, in large\npart, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge\nmay draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain an ADP I/II/III position.  The required showing of material\nbearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant\nhas actually abused a trust relationship before it can deny or revoke a trustworthiness determination.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to adhere to principles of trust.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant to establish his or her\ntrustworthiness  through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nApplicant is an assistant for a defense contractor who had one judgment taken against her and\naccumulated medically-related delinquent debts she attributes to co-pay issues, a significant\ndeficiency associated with a car repossession, and her continued probation status stemming from an\nalcohol-related incident in which she was convicted, ordered to pay significant restitution, and placed\non probation (twice since renewed due to her failure to comply with her original probation terms).\nWith the limited resources available to her, she has been able to keep up with her current\nhousehold expenses and debts (including he court-ordered restitution)  but not much more.  She has\nheard nothing from her old creditors in many years and is not the subject of any known collection\naction on her debts.  More recent efforts to elicit information from her largest medical creditor\n(creditor 1.b) have been unsuccessful.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended that he or she is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts,\nwhich heretofore she has not been in a position to address, warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: and DC\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations).\nExtenuating circumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s lack of sufficient income to\naddress many of her old debts, most of which she continues to dispute.   Due to her periods of\nunemployment and personal difficulties between 2000 and 2004 associated with her extended\nperiods of disability, and more recently, her relatively low levels of compensation generated  from\nher current work, she has not been able to make much headway in addressing any of her debts\n(disputed or otherwise).  MC 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline  (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibility) has some applicability to Applicant\u2019 situation.  Albeit, some\njudgment problems persist over the amount she expended (with the help of her boyfriend) on a late\nmodel car in 1999 without the available resources to sustain her agreed monthly payments, and more\nover the still outstanding  restitution she was court-ordered to make following her DuI/Endangerment\nconviction in January 2000.\nBecause of the limited income available to Applicant over the past six years, she has not\nheretofore been in a position to address her old debts (disputed or otherwise).  Most of Applicant\u2019s\nlisted debts appear to have been placed in collection before 2002, and are likely barred by Arizona\u2019s\ncontrolling statute of limitations.  The only clear exceptions are the judgment debt and the court-\nordered restitution debt, both of which have only been partially addressed by Applicant to date.\nNone of Applicant\u2019s listed medical and consumer debts reflect any collection action by the individual\ncreditors involved.   Based on this record, most of Applicant\u2019s covered debts appear to be barred\nfrom collection by the pertinent six-year statute of limitation in Arizona.  See \u00a712-548 of A.R.S.\n(2007).  \n\n7\nStatutes of limitation, while considered important policy tools for discouraging plaintiffs\nfrom pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation, have never been equated with good-\nfaith efforts to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April\n2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).   Still, they provide effective\ncollection barriers and, like bankruptcy, serve to insulate the debtor from pressures to raise cash to\nsatisfy his or her creditors.\nTo be sure, Applicant does not assert relevant statutes of limitation in Arizona in her defense.\nWith her limited income she has had difficulty making individual or collective progress (such as use\nof debt consolidation) on her listed debts.  At this time it is not clear what steps Applicant might\nconsider in the foreseeable future, if any, to resolve her mostly disputed and time barred debts.  If\nthese covered creditors are not willing or in a position to detail the bases of the debts, it is unlikely\nthey have any future interest in pursuing them.  While she has not sought financial counseling or\ninitiated constructive steps (such as petitioning for bankruptcy) to discharge or otherwise resolve her\ndebts, she is currently legally insulated from any collection action by the applicable Arizona statute\nof limitation, and for all practicable purposes, is no longer at risk to having to raise large sums of\nmoney to resolve her debts.  \nHolding a favorable trustworthiness determination involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.   Financial stability\nin a person cleared to access information covered by privacy rights is required precisely to inspire\ntrust and confidence in the holder of the trustworthiness determination. \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, the limited resources she has had to address them with, and the statute of\nlimitation protections now available to her,  she mitigates trustworthiness concerns related to her\ndebts.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the financial\nconsiderations guideline.\nApplicant\u2019s DuI/Endangerment offense and her probationary status\nWhile Applicant has no prior history of criminal activity that could raise questions about her\njudgment and trustworthiness, her 2000 DuI/Endangerment conviction does prompt concerns about\nher ability to comply with court orders.  Her ordered probation in 2000 included a $9,381.00\nrestitution condition that Applicant was unable to satisfy.  Her failure to satisfy the probation\nreporting, community service, and restitution requirements prompted the court to extend her probation\nfor three years (to April 2004).  And because of her still unsatisfied restitution, the court extended her\nprobation once more in 2007. At this time, she remains on probation, albeit compliant in her\nprobation requirements.  Because of this still outstanding restitution condition, trustworthy concerns\nabout her finances are further compounded.\nApplicant\u2019s two arrests, each arise out of the same original incident.  Her second arrest in \n2004 for violating her probation is really a compliance issue and is causally related to her problem\nfinances.  The initial DuI/Endangerment arrest and conviction and ensuing probation extensions\nresulting from Applicant\u2019s failure to satisfy the court\u2019s restitution order and resulting probation\nextensions are enough to warrant application of DC 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or\n\n8\nprobation) and DC 31(e) (violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated\nrehabilitation program) of the guidelines for criminal conduct.\nBecause she is still on probation, she is in a difficult position to take advantage of any of the\npotentially applicable mitigating conditions of Guideline J.  The underlying incident, however, is\nisolated..  Her probation officer credits her with compliance with her probation conditions.  And since\nthis 2000 offense, she has not committed any other offenses that could subject her to arrest (except\nfor her arrest for probation violation in 2004).  For this violation, she received extended probation.\nShe acknowledges poor judgment in the past and pledges to do the best she can in resolving her debts.\nBased on this record, some application of MC 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation,\nincluding but limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement) is warranted. \nBoth from a consideration of the applicable guidelines and from a whole person perspective,\nApplicant mitigates concerns stemming strictly from her 2000 arrest/conviction and related probation\nviolations that ensued based on her failure to satisfy restitution requirements.  Taking  into account\nall of the facts and circumstances developed in the record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect\nto the allegations covered by subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c of the SOR, as amended at hearing.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nE2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, conclusions and\nguidelines listed above, I make the following formal findings:\nFINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nFOR APPLICANT\n                            S ub-paras. 1.a - 1.l\n                                    FOR APPLICANT\nCRIMINAL CONDUCT:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted. \nRoger C.

Between August and October 2004,\nApplicant occasionally used marijuana with friends.  \nIn November 2004 Applicant submitted to a lifestyle polygraph.  He admitted his early use\nof marijuana to the polygrapher.  Upon further questioning, he admitted to his use between August\nand October 2004.  He stated that he would use marijuana again if offered but, after a discussion\nabout agency drug policy, advised that he would not use it in the future.  Based on the information\nobtained by the polygrapher, the agency terminated Applicant\u2019s access to Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation (SCI).  Applicant has not used marijuana since October 2004.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Department Counsel has\nnot expressly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Therefore, they are not at issue in this appeal.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.26(a).  \n1\nDecision at 8.  \n2\n3\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d  Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge favorably applied two mitigating conditions to Applicant\u2019s case, Drug\nInvolvement Mitigating Conditions (DIMC) 26(a) and (b).  The former reads as follows: \u201c[T]he\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur or does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgement.\u201d   The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s earlier use of marijuana occurred far in\n1\nthe past.  She further concluded that Applicant\u2019s more recent use was directly related to the\nemotionally disorienting effects of his marital breakup, stating \u201che is not likely to be involved in an\nemotionally devastating and unwanted divorce in the future.\u201d   She therefore concluded that\n2\nApplicant\u2019s past drug use does not impair his qualifications for a clearance.  \nDepartment Counsel claims error with regard to the Judge\u2019s analysis of the recency of\nApplicant\u2019s drug use, arguing that the totality of circumstances militate against a conclusion that\nsuch use occurred so long ago as not to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness.  Department\nCounsel\u2019s argument has merit.  Elapsed time between an applicant\u2019s last drug use and a Judge\u2019s\ndecision must be evaluated in light of the record as a whole.  In this case, it is true that Applicant\u2019s\nlast known use of marijuana occurred approximately two and a half years prior to the hearing.\n\n\u201cThe improper use of drugs by [agency] affiliates (e.g., [agency] employees, military assignees or\n3\nrepresentatives, contractors, consultants, and experts) and applicants is strictly prohibited.  Improper use includes the\nillegal use of controlled substances as well as the use, transfer, possession, sale, or purchase of any drug for purposes\nother than their intended medical use.  This policy may be reinforced through drug testing in accordance with [agency]\ndirective . . . Failure to observe the policies summarized above may constitute grounds for disqualification from initial\nor continued access to [agency] information and facilities.  Your signature below indicates your understanding and\nwillingness to comply with these policies.\u201d  Govt. Ex. 1 at 15.  \nSee, e. g., ISCR Case No. 05-03941 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug 2, 2007).\n4\nDirective \u00b6 E2.24.\n5\nDirective \u00b6 E2.26(b).  \n6\n4\nHowever, as Department Counsel notes, Applicant\u2019s last use occurred on 31 October 2004, merely\nfive days prior to the lifestyle polygraph, and that during the interview he initially stated to the\npolygrapher that he would use marijuana in the future, undercutting a claim of rehabilitation.\nDepartment Counsel mentions other aspects of the record which he contends are incompatible with\nthe Judge\u2019s favorable application of this mitigating condition, notably the fact that Applicant\u2019s more\nrecent use occurred after he had submitted his 2004 SCA, after he had signed an statement\nacknowledging agency policy forbidding drug abuse,   and while he held a top secret clearance.  \n3\nWhile Judges have leeway in evaluating the recency of an applicant\u2019s drug use,  any proposed\n4\nmitigation must be understood in light of the relevant security concerns.  Drug use raises concern\nbecause it \u201cmay impair judgement and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d   In this case, the record evidence cited by\n5\nDepartment Counsel significantly undercuts Applicant\u2019s efforts to establish his willingness to\ncomply with the law.  Indeed, the evidence shows that, in response to a traumatic event, his divorce,\nApplicant willingly turned to the use of marijuana, and there is nothing substantive in the record to\ndemonstrate that this is unlikely to recur, the possibility of encountering difficult circumstances\nbeing part of life.  Though the Judge stated that Applicant will never again be faced with an event\nthis personally devastating, this is speculative as there can be no evidence to support such an opinion.\nTo include this as a matter in mitigation was error.  As it is, Applicant\u2019s fourteen year hiatus between\nhis 1990 use of marijuana and his frequent use in 2004 forbids an easy conclusion that sufficient time\nhas passed since Applicant\u2019s last known use and the date of the hearing so as to ameliorate the\nsecurity concerns quoted above.  After considering the Judge\u2019s decision and the evidence as a whole,\nthe Board concludes that the record will not sustain a favorable application of DIMC 26(a).\nDIMC 26(b) provides that Guideline H security concerns can be mitigated by \u201ca\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation . . .\u201d   In her favorable application of this mitigating condition, the Judge\n6\nrelied on Applicant\u2019s testimony that he is spending more time with his family and is not associating\nwith his former drug-using companions.  \nThe Board gives due consideration to these matters but notes significant record evidence less\nfavorable to Applicant.  In addition to the matters discussed above, we draw attention to Government\nExhibit 3, an explanation of the agency decision to deny Applicant access to SCI, dated March 4,\n\nGovt. Ex. 3 at 1-2.  \n7\nTr. at 48.  \n8\n5\n2005.  It states that, during the interview with the polygrapher, Applicant advised that he used\nmarijuana twice in high school and twice in August 2004, during \u201ca low point in his life.\u201d  The\nexhibit states that Applicant initially denied any other drug use but, after further questioning,\nadmitted that he had used marijuana weekly between August 2004 and October 31, 2004 and that\n\u201che would use marijuana in the future if it was offered to him.  After being advised of [agency] drug\npolicy, [Applicant] stated that he \u2018thought he could abide by it.\u2019 Later in the interview [Applicant]\nadvised that he would abide by the drug policy and had no intention of using illegal drugs again.\u201d7\nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated that he had used marijuana only once in high school but that\nthe interview summary was otherwise accurate.   Given Applicant\u2019s drug use while holding a\n8\nclearance, his equivocations as to the extent of that use, and his ambivalent statements concerning\nhis intentions for the future, the record does not support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has\nmet his burden of persuasion as to DIMC 26(b).  The Board holds that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision\nunder Guideline H is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  In light of this holding the Board\nneed not address the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline E mitigating conditions.\n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.    \n         \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The hearing notice had been sent to his previous address.\n2\n2\nApplicant experimented twice with marijuana as a teenager and young adult. After a more\nthan 14-year absence, he started smoking marijuana again in August 2004, following the breakup\nof his 10-year marriage. After occasional use for the next three months, he stopped smoking it and\nchanged his lifestyle and friends, when he realized the negative effect his conduct was having on\nhim. He has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his drug involvement. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 3, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the\nSOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective for any SOR issued after September 1, 2006.\nDOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On December 1, 2006, Applicant\nsubmitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing on January 27, 2007.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on March 29, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on April\n16, 2007. I held a hearing on May 2, 2007. The government submitted five exhibits (GE), which\nwere marked and admitted into evidence as GE1-5. I raised questions regarding the admissibility of\nGE 5, an unsigned and unsworn summary report, dated November 5, 2004. I admitted this document\ninto evidence based on Applicant\u2019s statement that the information in this document reflected his\nbasic statements to an investigator.  Applicant did not submit any documents into the record.\n1\nApplicant and three witnesses testified. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 10,\n2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nInitially, Applicant received the notice of hearing, which had been mailed on April 16, 2007,\nat work about two weeks before the hearing and at home the night before the hearing. At the hearing\non May 2, 2007, Applicant waived his right to receive 15 days notice of the hearing. The hearing\nproceeded as scheduled.2\n\nConduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an\n3\napplicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances: (c) to consider whether an applicant has\ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is\napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole person analysis un Directive Section 6.3.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327\nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct 26,2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.24, 2003)).\nAt the hearing Applicant disagreed with certain facts in this report. Specifically, his disputed the factual\n4\nstatement that he smoked marijuana twice in high school, because he only smoked it once. He believes the report to be\ngenerally accurate, but could not say if it is completely accurate because he does not remember everything that was\ndiscussed or said. He adamantly stated during his testimony that the polygraph examination involved a dialogue between\nhe and the examiner which lead to questions and responses. Tr. at 39, 45, 85.\nGE 5 (November 5, 2004 unsigned summary report); Tr. at 39, 45, 76-80.\n5\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated December 1, 2006, at 1-2.\n6\n3\nAt the close of the testimony and immediately preceding closing argument, counsel for the\ngovernment moved to amend the SOR to add an allegation of falsification of material facts during\nhis interview with the National Security Agency (NSA) investigator on November 5, 2004.  The\n3\ngovernment sought to allege that Applicant falsified facts related to his marijuana use in September\nand October 2004 based on the investigator\u2019s written statement that he denied further marijuana use\nafter August 2004. The government submitted a copy of a November 5, 2004 report, which is a\nsummary of relevant information provided by Applicant to the NSA polygraph examiner, which I\nadmitted into evidence based on Applicant\u2019s statement that it generally reflected what he said to the\npolygraph examiner during his examination and considered it for its basic factual statements.  The\n4\nreport is not signed; the author is not known; and the author did not testify to authentic the contents\nof the document. At the hearing, Applicant credibly testified that the information in the report\nsummary is based on the dialogue developed during the course of his polygraph examination, not\nthe result of an interview prior to the administration of the polygraph examination or discussions\nconducted separately from the polygraph examination as implied by the language of the report. His\ncredible hearing testimony about the frequency of his use of marijuana in September and October\n2004 is consistent with his statements to the polygraph examiner about the frequency of his\nmarijuana use in this time period, and do not reflect intentional falsification. Although the\ngovernment received this report approximately six weeks prior to the hearing, it did not seek to\namend the SOR prior to the hearing, nor did it present or offer to present the preparer of the report\nas a witness. I denied the government\u2019s motion because its amendment raised a new issue based on\nthe summary report, without presenting the polygraph operator to authenticate the contents of the\nreport and clarify the context in which the statements were made - interview or examination. To have\ngranted the motion at the conclusion of all testimony would have violated Applicant\u2019s due process\nrights of notice and opportunity to respond.  In any event, I conclude the allegation of intentional\n5\nfalsification is not established.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline H and Guideline E of the SOR.  Those\n6\nadmissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record\nand upon due consideration, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance (SF-86), dated April 5, 2000 and resigned April 11,\n7\n2004) at 1-2; Tr. at 18, 28.\nGE 3 (NSA Clearance Decision Statement, dated March 2, 2005) at 1; Tr. at 28-30.\n8\nGE 1, supra note 7, at 3, 14; Tr. at 19, 28, 33, 35, 41-43.\n9\nTr. at 19-23, 28, 71-72.\n10\nId. at 23-27, 31\u201332, 41-43, 49-50.\n11\n4\nApplicant, a 39-year-old man, works for a Department of Defense contractor. He graduated\nfrom high school in 1986. Following high school, he attended a technical school for two years and\nwhen he completed his program, he received a diploma. He began employment with his current\nemployer over 19 years ago, while still a student at the technical school. He began working as a\ndraftsman. His employer regularly promoted him, and he now works as a senior civil designer, with\nsome managerial responsibilities.7\nWhile a 17-year-old high school student, Applicant smoked marijuana one time at a party.\nIn 1990, he smoked it once while on vacation. Applicant did not smoke marijuana for nearly 14 years\nthereafter.8\nApplicant married in 1994. He has two sons who are ages 10 and 5. In 2000, he completed\na security clearance application (SF-86). Based on the information in his application, he received a\nsecurity clearance and access to classified information. In April 2004, he resubmitted his SF-86\napplication. At this time, he signed the Personnel Security Policy Advisor (Form G3149), which\nadvises that the use of illegal drugs is prohibited. He acknowledged at the hearing that he knew\nillegal drug use was not permitted.9\nApplicant\u2019s wife told him that she wanted a divorce in the summer of 2004. Although he did\nnot want to end their marriage, in July 2004, he and his wife separated and he moved out of the\nmarital home. He sought help through the Employer Assistance Program at work with his emotional\nissues triggered by his wife\u2019s decision. After a few sessions, which included his wife, the counseling\nended without a need for a mental health referral or any diagnosis. After living with various family\nmembers, including his in-laws, Applicant moved in with his mother in August 2004.10\nShortly after he and his wife separated, Applicant started going out to bars in the evening to\nsocialize and to make new friends. He describes his attitude at this time as \u201cbad\u201d. He did not eat\nproperly and had trouble sleeping. He considered quitting his job. Between August and October\n2004, he regularly frequented local bars, and while socializing with his new friends at the bar, he\noccasionally smoked marijuana with one or two other individuals. He never purchased any marijuana\nduring this time nor did he arrive at work under the influence of marijuana or spend time with his\nchildren after using it. After a few months, he realized his new life style was tiring. He started\nspending more time with family and at family activities. He received the emotional support he\nneeded. He started eating and sleeping. He felt mentally stronger and physically healthier. He states\nhe returned to his person.11\n\nId. at 31-32, 39, 45-46.\n12\nGE 2 (NSA Denial of access to Sensitive Compartmented Information, dated March 4, 2005); GE 3, supra\n13\nnote 8, at 2-3.\nTr. at 25-27, 31-32, 40, 42, 44, 74.\n14\nId. at 44-45.\n15\n5\nBecause his employer performed work for the NSA, this agency required Applicant to\nundergo a polygraph examination, which he did on November 5, 2004. The polygraph examiner did\nnot conduct a pre-examination interview. Rather, the examiner asked questions in the form of a\ndialogue with Applicant. Based on the questions presented in the early portion of the polygraph\nexamination, Applicant provided information about his early use of marijuana. With the subsequent\nquestions, he provided further information regarding his more recent use of marijuana between\nAugust 2004 and October 2004. He did not attempt to hide his marijuana use. He also told the\npolygraph examiner that he would use marijuana again, if offered. After discussing the NSA drug\npolicy, Applicant told the polygraph examiner that he would abide by the policy and had no intent\nto use marijuana again. Applicant has not used other illegal drugs nor has he ever been arrested for\nany conduct related to illegal drug use.12\nBased on the information obtained at his polygraph examination, NSA denied Applicant\nAccess to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in a decision dated March 2, 2005. Without\narticulating any knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s most recent\ndecision to use marijuana and his years of work experience without incident, NSA concluded that\nhe exercised extremely poor judgment in his use of \u201cillegal drugs\u201d and could not be trusted in the\nfuture. Applicant did not appeal this decision.13\nApplicant has not used marijuana since October 2004. The polygraph examination caused\nhim to realize that his decision to occasionally use marijuana was a poor decision sending him down\nthe wrong path. Two and one-half years ago, he decided not to spend his evenings at a local bar and\nhe ceased his association with individuals who smoke marijuana. He changed his attitude towards\nlife and marijuana. He also accepted that his marital issues would not resolve. He spends his time\nwith his sons and family, and at family events. He acknowledged at the hearing that he did not tell\nhis employer about his marijuana use for fear of its impact on his job. He also has not told his family\nabout his marijuana use.14\nAt the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that the overall information contained in the\npolygraph examiner\u2019s summary was as he remembered. He, however, disputed certain details of this\nreport, including the statement that he used marijuana twice in high school, when he said once. He\ndescribed the polygraph examination as a process involving a series of questions which developed\nthrough an ongoing dialogue and did not include a separate interview. The government did not\nprovide any evidence in the form of a witness or documents, which contradicted Applicant\u2019s\ndescription of the process.15\nApplicant\u2019s security officer and co-worker of 10 years testified. She described him as\ndependable, trustworthy, and loyal. He comes to work every day. She knew about the change in his\nmarital situation, but saw no change in his work habits or abilities during this time of stress. She has\n\nId. at 53-59.\n16\nId. at 62-68.

She has no documentation which indicates that\nApplicant violated security procedures at any time, particularly during the period of July 2004\nthrough October 31, 2004.16\nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor testified. He first became acquainted with Applicant in\n1989, and since 1998, has been Applicant\u2019s supervisor. Applicant is in his top 10% of performers.\nHe rates Applicant\u2019s work as excellent. Applicant is very conscientious and reliable. He exercises\nsound judgment in performance of his work. Applicant has no disciplinary issues and no security\nviolations. Applicant\u2019s supervisor knew about his marital status change in 2004 and stated that\nApplicant was pretty upset about his separation and was impacted by this change in his life.\nApplicant\u2019s work performance did not decrease at the time of his separation.17\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.18\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n19\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n20\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n21\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd., Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n22\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n22\nclearance decision.23\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n24\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n25\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n26\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n27\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.28\n(AG \u00b6 24) Applicant used marijuana once as a high school student and once on vacation in 1990.\nAlthough he abstained from smoking marijuana for many years, in August 2004, he started smoking\nmarijuana occasionally after being granted a security clearance. He never purchased it for use, but\npossessed it when smoking. He has never been arrested for this activity. Based on the evidence of\nrecord, DC \u00b6 25(a) any drug abuse; DC \u00b6 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase sale, or distribution, and DC \u00b6 25(g) any illegal drug use after\nbeing granted a security clearance apply.\n\nMC \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) 26(d) are not relevant to this case.\n29\n8\nSecurity concerns can be mitigated under MC \u00b6 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright\nline\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent\u201d. The determination must be based \u201con a careful\nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No.\n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has\npassed without any evidence of misconduct\u201d, then an administrative judge must determine whether\nthat period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding\nof reform or rehabilitation.\u201d Id. MC \u00b6 26(a) has some applicability in this case. Applicant\u2019s one time\nexperimentation with marijuana as a high school student occurred more than 20 years ago and his\none time experimentation with marijuana in 1990 happened 17 years ago. He last used marijuana two\nand one-half years ago during a period of extreme emotional distress created by his wife\u2019s decision\nto end their marriage, which he did not want. While other emotional crises may possibly occur in the\nfuture, he is not likely to be involved in an emotionally devastating and unwanted divorce in the\nfuture. His past conduct does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.\nMC \u00b6 26(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used; and (3) and appropriate period of abstinence applies. Applicant initially\nexperimented with marijuana as a high school student and young man. His experimentation did not\nlead to further use. Rather, he abstained from using marijuana for 14 years. When his life changed\nfrom married to single without warning, a highly emotional time, he sought new single friends by\nhanging around bars. He found new friends who occasionally offered him a marijuana cigarette. For\na few months, he continued to hang around these individuals. However, in a short time, he realized\nthe negative effect his conduct had on him physically and emotionally. He began to change his\nattitude which lead to a change in his friends and places for social contacts. Applicant stopped going\nto bars for social contact in October 2004. Instead, he started spending more time with family and\nwork friends after realizing that his recent conduct was leading him in the wrong direction. With this\nchange in his social life, he associating with individuals who smoked marijuana. Furthermore,\nsubsequent to his polygraph examination, he realized he needed to avoid any further contact with\nthose who smoked marijuana, which he has done. He has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about\nhis drug involvement.29\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant admitted\nto his one time use of marijuana as a teenager and as a young adult. He also admitted to occasionally\nusing marijuana for three months in 2004, immediately after his wife requested a divorce. At this\ntime, he held a security clearance and violated the rules against using an illegal substance.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises the possible application of DC \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that\nis not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person\n\n9\nassessment of a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is\nnot limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\nMC \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC \u00b6 17(d) the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; MC \u00b6 17(e) the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation,\nor duress; and MC \u00b6 17(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased \u2026 may\napply. Resolution of the issues raised in this guideline will be discussed in the whole person analysis,\ninfra.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nApplicant\u2019s experimental use of marijuana as a teenager and young man occurred many years\nago. His decision, however, to occasionally smoke marijuana in 2004 while holding a security\nclearance is serious misconduct. He made this decision at a time when his life, as he had known it\nfor 10 years, fell apart without warning. His wife\u2019s request to end their marriage took him by surprise\nand at the same time, devastated him emotionally. For a few months, he attempted to develop a new\nsocial network by going to bars and drinking with the people he met at the bars. On a few occasions,\nhe smoked marijuana with one or two others when offered. He never purchased it. By the end of\nOctober 2004, he got tired of this new life and began spending more time with family and at family\nactivities. When he took the polygraph examination, he realized that he had made a bad decision\nabout smoking marijuana and about the direction of his personal life. He decided he needed to\nchange his habits and life style, and he did. He stopped going to bars. He no longer associates with\nthe individuals he met there. He told the polygraph operator that he could abide by the policy against\ndrug use and has because he changed his social patterns. He learned that his family provided the\nsupport he needed to progress with his new life.\nDuring this time of emotional crisis, Applicant continued to perform his work duties at his\nusual high level of performance. For this part of his life, he continued to make appropriate decisions\nand exercised good judgment. He never mishandled classified information and continued to work\non a regular basis. \nThe polygraph examiner focused the questions on Applicant\u2019s use of drugs. He answered the\nquestions truthfully. The examiner did not address the reasons surrounding his decision to smoke\n\n10\nmarijuana in 2004. NSA based its decision to deny Applicant SCI access on the polygraph\nexaminer\u2019s limited findings. In reaching my conclusion, I considered NSA\u2019s decision and its\nunderlying basis. Although the decision purports to consider the whole person, the decision does not\nreflect other facts outside of Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana. It loosely characterized Applicant\u2019s use\nof marijuana as multiple drugs (the decision referenced the use of \u201cillegal drugs\u201d), which is\ninaccurate and not support by the evidence. Thus, NSA\u2019s decision is entitled to limited weight.\nBecause this decision was rendered more than two years ago and much closer to the time when\nApplicant actually smoked marijuana, I also considered Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment he could abide\nby the no drug policy and his compliance with this acknowledgment for the last two years and one\nhalf years. \nApplicant broke the rule against use of an illegal substance when he decided to smoke\nmarijuana. He recognized the error of his ways and corrected both his attitude and his conduct. I have\ncarefully weighed the mitigating factors, the totality of the circumstances surrounding his decision\nto smoke marijuana in 2004, his honesty in revealing this information, his work ethic, his recent\nconduct, and his change in attitude against the seriousness of his misconduct. I have concluded that\nhe would not act in a manner which would harm the government. There is little likelihood he could\nbe pressured, coerced, exploited, or subjected to duress for his past conduct. He learned that his\nfamily was important to him. He has also accepted that his marriage has ended. There is little\nlikelihood that his use of marijuana would occur in the future. Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns pertaining to his drug involvement and his personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline H :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-e: \n   For Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a: \n   For Applicant\nDECISION\n\n11\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 24, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\napplication of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 8(b) was arbitrary, capricious, and\ncontrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was arbitrary, capricious, and\ncontrary to law.   Finding error, we reverse.\n1\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings:  Applicant is a 41-year-old divorced man\nwith no children.  He was born in Iran and emigrated to the U.S. in 1993 after living in a European\ncountry for several years.  He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since 1998.  He is a personal\nprotection officer.  He earned an associate\u2019s degree in economics from an Iranian university in the\n1980s.\nApplicant\u2019s father was a high-ranking official under the Shah\u2019s regime.  He retired in the\n1970s.  After the 1979 revolution, his family was harassed by extremists, who made death threats.\n The harassment grew so severe that they had to separate for their safety and seek \u201csecure and secret\nplace[s] to survive.\u201d   Approximately a year later, the revolutionary fervor subsided, allowing them\n2\nto reunite.\nIn the mid-1980s, Applicant served in the Iranian army.  At the time, the country was at war\nwith Iraq, and military service was mandatory.  After his discharge from the military, the government\njailed him under false charges.  Applicant testified that this was due to his \u201cnot agreeing with their\npolitics.\u201d   A relative managed to get him released from jail, and Applicant fled the country, crossing\n3\nthe border into Turkey at great personal risk.  Once Applicant reached Turkey, he caught a plane\nbound for a European country, where a distant relative lived.  Shortly after arriving, he was granted\npolitical asylum.  Applicant feared that his life would have been in jeopardy if he had returned to\nIran.\n\nTr. 63.\n4\n3\nThroughout the process, Applicant was assisted by a person whom he paid $3,000.  His\nfamily helped him accumulate the money by selling much of their personal valuables.  While living\nin Europe, Applicant started working various jobs in security at several night clubs, and eventually\nbecame a professional bodyguard.\nApplicant emigrated to the United States in 1993.  In 1994, after four months of specialized\ntraining, he obtained a professional bodyguard\u2019s license.  Since that time, he has worked several\nstints as a professional bodyguard, in addition to other related occupations such as private\ninvestigations and hotel security.  Over the years, he has taken extensive continuing education\ncourses in order to retain his bodyguard\u2019s license.  He is also licensed to carry firearms in 35 states.\nApplicant has worked for the same company since 2003.  He was recently promoted to director of\npersonal protection.  Also, he works as a firearms instructor for a subsidiary company.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job and in his community. A character witness who is\na police officer testified at the hearing.  Having observed Applicant in his professional capacity when\nthey worked together on a part-time security enforcement job, and in his personal capacity as a\nlongtime friend, he described him as a \u201cman of honor . . .whose greatest mission is to serve the\nU.S.\u201d   Among the former employers who praised his professionalism include a retired special agent\n4\nwith the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Internal Affairs, and a former personnel security\nspecialist.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and two of his sisters live in Iran.  He has not seen them since he fled Iran\nin the 1980s.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father is strained.  They do not correspond and have\nonly talked with one another once in the past five years.  Applicant is close to his mother.  He\nconsiders her a friend and talks with her once a week.  His parents have been separated for\napproximately 10 to 15 years.\nApplicant\u2019s sisters living in Iran are both homemakers.  He talks to them every two to four\nmonths.  He has another sister, a citizen and resident of a European country.  He visited her\napproximately two years ago.  Currently, he talks to her a few times per week.  There is no record\nevidence of when she emigrated from Iran.\nApplicant has one brother, also a citizen and resident of the same European country as the\nsister.  He emigrated there from Iran in 2001.  In the ten years before he left Iran, he worked in law\nenforcement, focusing exclusively on drug interdiction.  Fearing retribution against him by drug\nlords or other corrupt officials, he sought asylum in Europe.  Applicant traveled there to visit his\nbrother in approximately 2001.  Although he has not seen him since then, he talks to him \u201ca couple\nof times a week.\u201d\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iran.  He does not receive a pension from Iran for his\nservice in the Iranian military.  Approximately two years after emigrating to the United States,\n\n4\nApplicant legally changed his name.  He legally adopted an Americanized name in order to be more\nconsistent with U.S. society.  \nB.

Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\n\n5\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nHaving properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raised Foreign Influence security concerns,\nthe Judge considered the extent to which Applicant had demonstrated mitigation.  The Judge\nextended favorable application to FIMC 8(b), which mitigates security concerns when \u201cthere is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest . . .\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.8(b).  In so concluding, the\nJudge relied upon Applicant\u2019s having lived in the U.S. for over 12 years, his having legally assumed\nan anglicized name, and the fact that his closest friend is a U.S. citizen.  The Judge\u2019s reasoning\nappears to be that these matters demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S. are so strong that he\nwould not compromise U.S. interests should he be faced with that choice.\nDepartment Counsel argues that these matters are not sufficient to establish mitigation under\nFIMC 8(b).  The Board finds this argument persuasive.  An applicant with family members living\nin a country hostile to the U.S. bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d in demonstrating that those members do not\npose a security risk.  See ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007).  A reasonable\nperson could conclude that, given Applicant\u2019s history, he feels a greater sense of obligation to the\nU.S. than to Iran.  However, FIMC 8(b)  focuses analysis not merely upon an applicant\u2019s sympathies\nwith his birth country as such, but also with family members residing therein.  In the case under\nconsideration, the issue is whether Applicant\u2019s attachment to his family, especially his mother, whom\nhe describes as a friend and with whom he speaks once a week, is outweighed by his attachments\nwithin the U.S.  On this point, as Department Counsel observes, the record is spare.  Applicant is\ndivorced and has no children, therefore lacking family connections in this country.  Neither is there\nevidence of substantial community ties within the U.S.  The factors cited by the Judge, while not\ninsignificant, do not show such deep and longstanding relationships in the U.S. so as to outweigh\nApplicant\u2019s admitted strong ties to his mother.  Without impugning Applicant\u2019s loyalty and integrity,\nit must be observed that, on this record, Applicant has not met his \u201cheavy burden\u201d of demonstrating\nthat the security concerns arising from his foreign relatives are sufficiently mitigated so as to warrant\nthe grant of a security clearance.   \nFor similar reasons, the Board concludes that the record will not sustain a favorable whole-\nperson analysis.  The Judge based his whole-person analysis upon Applicant\u2019s escape from Iran,\ncontending that in doing so Applicant demonstrated a willingness to act against Iranian interests even\nat personal peril.  This testimony was evidence the Judge had to consider.  However, Department\nCounsel argues that it does not demonstrate that Applicant would act in the interests of the U.S. over\nthose of his family, should the occasion arise.  For example, Applicant testified that it was his\nmother\u2019s decision that he leave Iran, and his family sold their household goods to obtain money\nsufficient to pay for his escape.  This testimony underscores Applicant\u2019s strong obligations to his\nfamily, which is the basis for the security concerns in his case.  The Judge noted that Iran is hostile\n\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 4, Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report to Congress, \u201cIran: U.S. Concerns\n5\nand Policy Responses,\u201d at 24 June 4, 2007.  \nId.  \u201c[A]s part of its effort to build influence in Iraq, Iran is providing arms (including highly lethal \u2018explosively\n6\nforced projectiles,\u2019 EFPs, that have killed about 170 U.S. soldiers in Iraq) and financing to Shiite militias.\u201d  \nGE 5, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006 at 16 March 6, 2007.  This document quotes the\n7\nPresident of Iran as stating publicly that \u201cIsrael must the wiped off the map\u201d and that it \u201cwill one day vanish.\u201d  \n6\nto the U.S. and is a sponsor of terrorism; that it has an \u201cabysmal\u201d human rights record; and that its\nsecurity forces have monitored private activities of citizens, entered homes, monitored phone\nconversations, and opened mail.  The Board notes other record evidence, such as Iran\u2019s efforts to\ndominate the Iraqi government;  its connection with militant factions engaged in hostilities against\n5\nthe U.S. and its allies;  and its public call for the annihilation of Israel.   When viewed in light of\n6\n7\nrecord evidence that Applicant\u2019s family has been targeted by the regime for political reasons, it is\nforeseeable that they could come to the attention of Iranian authorities and become a means through\nwhich the regime could attempt to coerce Applicant to compromise U.S. secrets.  As Department\nCounsel points out, the record does not demonstrate that Applicant would necessarily place the\ninterests of the U.S. ahead of the interests of his own mother.  A careful review of the entire record\nleads the Board to conclude that Applicant has not satisfied his burden of persuasion that it is\n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for him to have a clearance.   Egan, 484\nU.S. at 528.   Accordingly, the Board holds that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, and\ncontrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jean E.

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s potential vulnerability to coercion through his relatives who are Iranian citizens\nand residents generates a security concern. Upon analyzing his strong character and his longstanding\nties to the United States, in tandem with the fact that he previously overcame intimidation and\ncoercion from the Iranian government, I conclude he has mitigated the security concern. Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nTr. 50.\n1\nSee generally, Hearing Exhibits I-VIII.\n2\nTr. 69.\n3\n2\nOn May 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on May 22, 2007, admitting Paragraphs 1 and 2, denying Paragraphs 3 and 4, and\nrequesting a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on July 23, 2007. On August 14, 2007, DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing scheduling it for September 12, 2007. During the hearing, I received five government\nexhibits, two Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. At the close of the\nhearing, I left the record open through September 26, 2007 to allow Applicant to submit additional\nexhibits. That day, he submitted two additional exhibits that I incorporated into the record. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on September 20, 2007.\nRULINGS ON EVIDENCE\nAt the hearing, department counsel moved to withdraw the allegations under Paragraph 3 of\nthe SOR, and I granted the motion.  Also, at department counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative\n1\nnotice of  several relevant adjudicative facts about Iran. They are as follows:\n1. Iran is hostile to the interests of the United States, and the State Department has designated\nit as a state sponsor of terrorism;\n2. Iran is attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n3. Iran has an abysmal human rights record. The abuses include summary executions, lack\nof fair public trials, arbitrary arrest and detention, and severe restrictions on civil liberties including\nspeech, press assembly, association, movement, and privacy; and,\n4. Iranian security forces have at times monitored the social activities of its citizens, entered\nhomes and offices, monitored phone conversations, and opened mail without court authorization.2\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old divorced man with no children. He was born in Iran and emigrated\nto the U.S. in 1993 after living in Germany for six years. He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since\n1998. He is a personal protection officer.

At the time, the\n10\ncountry was at war with Iraq, and military service was mandatory.  While in the Army, Applicant\n11\nwas involved in front-line combat.12\nApplicant returned home in 1986 after he completed his military service. Shortly thereafter,\nhe was charged with leaving the military without returning his weapon, and was jailed. The charges\nwere false. The government manufactured them because of his family background, and because\nApplicant \u201cwas not agreeing with their politics.\u201d13\nAccording to Applicant, gun violations in Iran are capital crimes.  His uncle, an Iranian\n14\nequivalent of a local district attorney, managed to get him released from jail while the charges were\npending.  Applicant then fled the country, crossing the border into Turkey overnight on a donkey.\n15\n16\nOnce Applicant reached Turkey, he caught a plane bound for Germany, where a distant\nrelative lived.

He then started\n20\nworking various jobs in security at several night clubs, and eventually became a professional\nbodyguard.21\nApplicant emigrated to the United States in 1993. In 1994, after four months of specialized\ntraining, he obtained a professional bodyguard\u2019s license.

Over the years, he has taken extensive continuing education courses\n23\nin order to retain his bodyguard\u2019s license.  In addition to his professional bodyguard\u2019s license, he is\n24\nlicensed to carry firearms in 35 states.25\nApplicant has worked for the same company since 2003. He was recently promoted to director\nof personal protection.  Also, he works as a firearm instructor for a subsidiary company.\n26\n27\nApplicant is highly respected on the job and in his community. A character witness who is a\npolice officer testified at the hearing.

They do not correspond, and have only\n31\n32\ntalked with one another once in the past five years.  Applicant is close to his mother. He considers\n33\nher a friend, and talks with her once a week.  His parents have been separated for approximately 10\n34\nto 15 years.\nApplicant\u2019s sisters living in Iran are both homemakers. He talks to them every two to four\nmonths.  He has another sister. She is a citizen and resident of the Netherlands. He visited her in the\n35\nNetherlands approximately two years ago.  Currently, he talks to her a few times per week.  There\n36\n37\nis no record evidence of when she emigrated from Iran.\nApplicant has one brother. He is a citizen and resident of the Netherlands. He emigrated there\nfrom Iran in 2001. In the ten years before he left Iran, he worked in law enforcement.  He exclusively\n38\nfocused on drug interdiction. He was an honest agent working in a corrupt system.  Fearing\n39\nretribution against him by drug lords or other corrupt officials, he sought asylum in the Netherlands.40\nApplicant traveled to the Netherlands to visit his brother in approximately 2001. Although he has not\nseen him since then, he talks to him \u201ca couple of times a week.\u201d41\n\nExhibit 2 at 8.\n42\nId.\n43\nAnswer.\n44\nTr. 42.\n45\nTr. 78.\n46\nISCR Case No. 03-12882 (App. Bd. July 20, 2005).\n47\n6\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iran.  He does not receive a pension from Iran for his\n42\nservice in the Iranian military.43\nApplicant did not disclose that he had a brother and sister living in the Netherlands, as\nrequired on his security clearance application. He did not have their addresses at the time he\nsubmitted the application.  When he obtained the information, he provided the information to a\n44\nsecurity clearance investigator.  He listed all his other relatives, disclosed his service in the Iranian\n45\nmilitary, and disclosed his father\u2019s prior service as a high-ranking officer in the Iranian army.\nApproximately two years after emigrating to the United States, Applicant legally changed his\nname. He adopted an Americanized name to \u201chonor the custom and culture of the country.\u201d46\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that\nmay be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nThe mere presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not dispositive of\na case.  Instead, their analysis is part of a broader adjudicative process which involves the\n47\nconsideration of all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable. \nAs part of this process, a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d must be\nevaluated. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the age of the applicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in\neach case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n48\nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) Paragraph 9.\n49\nAG Paragraph 6.\n50\n7\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n48\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Preference\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s service in the Iranian Army in the\n49\nmid - 1980s triggers the application of Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition 10(a)(2): exercise\nof any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through\nthe foreign citizenship of a family member [including] military service or a willingness to bear arms\nfor a foreign country.\nApplicant\u2019s Iranian military service was compulsory, and occurred before he emigrated to the\nUnited States. Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 11(c): exercise of the rights, privileges, or\nobligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor, applies.\nForeign Influence\n\u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents and two sisters\n50\nresiding in Iran and his two siblings residing in the Netherlands raise the issue of whether Foreign\nInfluence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 7 a): contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion, applies. Although friendly countries can engage in activities involving coercion,\npersuasion or duress of an individual to gather classified information as readily as hostile countries,\n\nISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. June 27, 2003, at 5).\n51\n8\nthe risk of such activity is heightened with hostile countries because such countries are \u201cnot likely to\nhave scruples about pressuring one of its citizens\u201d to obtain classified information.  \n51\nIran is both intensely authoritarian and hostile to the United States. Consequently, FI DC 7(a)\napplies to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family members who are citizens and residents of Iran.\nConversely, no record evidence exists of either any enmity between the Netherlands and the\nU.S. or any deprivation of human rights of the Dutch people by its government. FI DC 7(a) does not\napply to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his sister living in the Netherlands. Although Applicant\u2019s\nbrother was previously a special agent in Iran before emigrating to the Netherlands, his work was\nlimited to drug interdiction. Moreover, he quit the job more than six years ago, and sought asylum\nin the Netherlands out of disgust for his home country. Under these circumstances, FI DC 7(a) does\nnot apply to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brother, either.\nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s position in the Shah\u2019s regime placed himself and his family at risk after\nthe 1979 revolution. Later, it served as an underlying factor leading to the false weapons charge\nagainst Applicant in the mid-1980s. Consequently, although they are estranged, Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s\nstatus with the former regime and the history of persecution continue to create a risk of coercion.\nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons\nin that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S., does not apply to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father.\nApplicant\u2019s family experienced persecution after the 1979 revolution, and the government\nremains extraordinarily repressive. Consequently, FC MC 8(a) is also inapplicable to Applicant\u2019s\nrelationship with his mother and sisters living in Iran. The infrequent, casual nature of Applicant\u2019s\ncommunication with his sisters could conceivably trigger the application of FC MC 8(c): contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. However, their contact is not casual and\ninfrequent enough to overcome the risk of coercion posed by the Iranian government in light of its\nuniquely hostile and repressive nature.\nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for more than 12 years. To acknowledge his profound\nappreciation for American culture and ideals, he legally changed his name, adopting an Americanized\none. His closest friend, the police officer who testified at the hearing, is a U.S. citizen. FC MC 8(b):\nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest, applies.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\n\nAG Paragraph 15.\n52\nISCR Case No.  03-09053 (App. Bd. March 29, 2006 at 5).\n53\nSee ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. October 16, 2002).\n54\n9\nand ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s omission of his siblings living in\n52\nthe Netherlands from his 2004 security clearance application raises the issue of whether Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, applies. Given that Applicant listed his service in\nthe Iranian army, his father\u2019s status in the Shah\u2019s government, and his relatives living in Iran, I\nconclude that his explanation for not listing his two siblings in the Netherlands was credible. PC DC\n16(a) does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant is potentially vulnerable to coercion by the Iranian government through his relatives\nliving in Iran. His emphatic statement that he would not succumb to such coercion does not trigger\nthe applicability of FC MC 8 (a). Because an analysis of the potentially applicable mitigating\nconditions is merely one component of the security suitability analysis, however, his statement must\nbe evaluated further in the broader context of the whole person concept. \nAccording to the Appeal Board, \u201can applicant\u2019s stated intention about what he or she might\ndo in the future under some hypothetical set of circumstances is merely a statement of intention that\nis not entitled to much weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar\nmanner in the past.\u201d  Here, Applicant has acted in a similar manner in the past. When he considered\n53\nfleeing Iran in 1987, he was keenly aware, as one who had previously experienced persecution by the\nIranian government, of the potentially fatal consequences to himself and his family if he failed. This\nneither deterred him from fleeing nor his family from helping him. In this context, Applicant\u2019s\nstatement that he would not succumb to any future pressure from the Iranian government is entitled\nto significant weight.\nIn weighing Applicant\u2019s statement in this manner, I am in no way implying that the\ngovernment must wait until the Iranian government threatens him or his family, then see how he\nresponds to such threats.  Rather, I have evaluated it in conjunction with a number of other positive\n54\nfactors including his courage, character, credibility, professional competence, and longstanding ties\nto the U.S. When viewed together, these positive factors outweigh the security concerns generated\nby the presence of his immediate family members in Iran. I conclude he has carried the burden.\nClearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 - Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline F:\nWITHDRAWN\nParagraph 4 - Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On January 16, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\n\nAn Under Other than Honorable Conditions (formerly called Undesirable) Discharge is the lowest service\n1\ncharacterization possible for administrative discharges from the military.  The other two are Honorable and Under\nHonorable Conditions.  See 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 724.109(a).  \n2\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 28, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Christopher Graham granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings\nabout certain of Applicant\u2019s debts are supported by record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant mitigated the allegation concerning misuse of a corporate credit card is arbitrary and\ncapricious; whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not provide knowingly false\ninformation concerning his military discharge failed to take into account contrary record evidence;\nand whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s Guideline E security concerns had been\nmitigated was arbitrary and capricious.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a senior engineer\nemployed by a defense contractor.  Applicant has amassed numerous unpaid debts, although he has\nentered into payment plans with his creditors and, in addition, he has received credit counseling.  \nQuestion 17 of the Security Clearance Application (SCA), dated December 6, 2006,  inquired\nif Applicant had ever received less than an honorable discharge from the military.  Applicant\nanswered \u201cno,\u201d even though he had previously been discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve with\nan Under Other Than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC) discharge.   \n1\nWhile working for a previous employer, Applicant had used a company credit card for\npersonal expenses, specifically traveling to visit his mother, who was ill.  This was a violation of\ncompany rules and the employer fired Applicant.  In an interview with a Special Agent (SA) of the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant stated that he had spent only $500 on the credit\ncard, though in truth the amount was between $2000 and $3000.  Applicant also failed to list seven\nbad debts in responding to a SCA question about financial delinquencies. \n \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\n\n3\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Department Counsel avers that the\nJudge\u2019s decision did not take into account significant record evidence.  The Board will address this\nmatter in the discussion below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nWhether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant did not falsify Question 17 of his\nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA).\nAs stated above, Question 17 of the SCA asked, \u201cHave you ever received other than an\nhonorable discharge from the military,\u201d to which Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d  In fact Applicant had\nbeen discharged from the Marine Reserve with a UOTHC.  The Judge accepted Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation that he did not know he had received such a discharge, having left the Marines \u201cwithout\n\nDecision at 5.  \n2\nThis memo is included in Government Exhibit (GE) 6, Memorandum for Recruiting and Retention Office.  It\n3\nreads in pertinent part: \u201cIt was only after I recently was trying to enlist in the Army National Guard that I discovered that\nI had been separated from the USMCR under other than honorable conditions due to unsatisfactory participation.\u201d    \nAnswer to SOR at 2: \u201cIn August 2006 I received notice from my OCS chain of command that the discharge\n4\nI had received from the U.S. Marine Corps was Other than Honorable for unsatisfactory performance.  With the help of\nmy chain of command, I immediately sent appeals paperwork to the U.S. Department of the Navy, along with seven\nletters of recommendation from U.S. Army officers in my OCS chain of command on my behalf.  This appeal is currently\npending.\u201d  \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A, Memorandum for Recommendation of Commissioning.  \n5\nGE 5 at 7.  \n6\nConcerning the memo in GE 6, Applicant testified that it was written by a recruiter and that he signed it without\n7\nreading it carefully.  Tr. at 30.  Regarding the statement in GE 5 that Applicant had waived his right to a discharge board\nprior to having received a UOTHC, he testified, \u201cYour Honor, I do not recall waiving any of my rights as part of my\nseparation from the Marine Corps.\u201d  Tr. at 98.  Applicant has presented no evidence to rebut the presumption of good\nfaith and regularity in the processing of his discharge.  See ISCR Case No. 02-10446 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2005).\nApplicant\u2019s claim not to remember essential details of so significant an aspect of his military career would cause a\nreasonable person to question his credibility.  The Judge does not address this, however.  The Judge also found that\n\u201c[e]very time [Applicant] requested a copy of his form DD 214 [Certificate of Release form Active Duty] from military\npersonnel records, the form states he received an honorable discharge.\u201d  Decision at 5.  From this the Judge concluded\nthat Applicant was reasonably mistaken as to his service characterization.   However, the record contains only one DD\n4\nmaking sure that all of his paperwork was in order.\u201d   Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s\n2\nanalysis fails to take into account contrary record evidence.  The Board finds Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument persuasive.\nThere is significant evidence contrary to the Judge\u2019s decision on this issue, the record\ncontaining a number of documents which demonstrate that Applicant was aware of his service\ncharacterization at the time he submitted his SCA.  For example, in April 2005 Applicant sought to\nbecome an officer in a state National Guard.  In furtherance of this goal Applicant submitted a\nmemorandum to the state\u2019s Adjutant General, dated April 13, 2005, urging his acceptance into the\nGuard despite his having received a UOTHC from the Marines.   Another document, Applicant\u2019s\n3\nresponse to the SOR, avers that he was advised by the National Guard chain of command in August\n2006 that he had received such a discharge.   In addition, Applicant\u2019s evidence at the hearing\n4\nincluded a letter of recommendation by a National Guard Official recommending a upgrade of\nApplicant\u2019s discharge from a UOTHC to a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions.  On its\nface it reflects that Applicant received a copy of the letter, raising the reasonable implication that\nApplicant was aware of its contents as to his discharge status.   Yet another document, a\n5\nmemorandum from an official in the Marine Reserve to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, dated\nMay 5, 1994, states that Applicant had been discharged UOTHC and that he had waived his\nentitlement to an administrative hearing on the matter.   Although these documents do not contain\n6\nconsistent information as to the precise date upon which Applicant was advised of his UOTHC, their\nclear import is that he was so advised well prior to his submission of the SCA in December 2006,\nsignificantly detracting from Applicant\u2019s claim of ignorance as to his service characterization.  The\nJudge did not discuss these pieces of contrary evidence, nor did he seriously evaluate the credibility\nof Applicant\u2019s various explanations.   The Judge\u2019s decision failed to examine relevant record\n7\n\n214 evidencing an honorable discharge for Applicant, one issued in 1991 upon his release from active duty into the\nreserves.  There is no copy of a DD 214 purporting to show that his release from the reserves in 1994 was honorable.\nFurthermore, this DD 214 was received by Applicant from the National Personnel Records Center  in 2007, after he had\nsubmitted his SCA.  There are no documents in the record to buttress Applicant\u2019s claim that, when he completed the SCA\nin December 2006, he honestly believed he had never received less than an honorable discharge from the U.S. military.\nTr. at 17.  Compare this testimony with Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR: \u201cI deny that I deliberately falsified\n8\ninformation during my interview with a Special Agent of [OPM] . . . I did not purposefully conceal any information that\nI knew at that time.\u201d  \nDecision at 9-10.  \n9\nDirective \u00b6 E2.17(c).\n10\n5\nevidence and failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for its conclusion.  Accordingly, the Board\nholds that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not knowingly falsify his answer to Question\n17 is error.\nWhether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s false statement about a credit card\ndebt had been mitigated.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had improperly used a company credit card for personal\nexpenses and had made a false statement as to the amount of those expenses.  In an interview with\na special investigator Applicant stated that the amount of the personal charges on the credit card was\n$500.  In reality, the extent of these charges was much more, the SOR alleging over $8000,\nApplicant admitting to $2000 to $3000.  Applicant testified that he purposely understated the amount\nof these improper charges due to \u201cgrave embarrassment.\u201d  He stated that, immediately following the\ninterview, he regretted the statement, although he acknowledged that he did not correct it in a\nsubsequent interview.   The Judge concluded that this misconduct was mitigated insofar as \u201che\n8\ndisclosed his improper use of the credit card, that he was fired by his employer, even though the use\nwas in an unusual and stressful situation.  The fact is he did not remember the exact amount.  He\nguessed at it.  It was too low, but he did disclose the series of incidents that caused the debt.\u201d   The\n9\nJudge concluded that Applicant had mitigated the security concern raised by this false statement,\nunder Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PCMC) 17(c) and (d).  \nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s application of these mitigating\nconditions is in error.   The former mitigates Personal Conduct security concerns when \u201cthe offense\nis so minor, or so much time as passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d   The Judge\u2019s decision does not appear to take into\n10\naccount significant contrary record evidence.  The Judge does not discuss how it is that a false\nstatement made after he submitted the SCA is not recent, nor how is it that one made for purposes\nof obtaining a security clearance is minor.  Neither does the Judge explain how it is that this\nparticular false statement was unlikely to recur, insofar as Applicant, subsequent to his interview,\nrepeated it in his answer to the SOR.  More significantly, the Judge does not address the contrast\nbetween Applicant\u2019s SOR answer and his testimony on this particular security concern.  He does not\nattempt to explain why this inconsistency is merely apparent rather than actual, or why, even if\nactual, it is of limited weight in evaluating the credibility of Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.17(d).  \n11\n6\nAll in all, the Judge\u2019s explanation for his favorable application of this PCMC 17(c) runs contrary to\nthe record evidence and, on the facts of this case, is not sustainable.  \nPCMC 17(d) mitigates Guideline E concerns when \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate\nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d   As regards this mitigating condition, the Judge\n11\ngave credit to Applicant for having admitted to his employer that he misused his company credit\ncard.  However, the Guideline E concerns arising out of this misconduct are not limited to\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of the card but extend to his subsequent false statement to the investigator as to\nthe amount of the improper charges.  The Judge does not explain why Applicant\u2019s relatively belated\nacknowledgment at the hearing that he significantly understated this amount  satisfies the first clause\nof PCMC 17(d).  Furthermore, when viewed in conjunction with Applicant\u2019s false statement about\nhis military discharge, it is not reasonable to conclude that Applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation.\nAccordingly, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s favorable application of the Guideline E\nmitigating conditions to Applicant\u2019s false statement about his military discharge and to his false\nstatement about the amount of his misuse of the credit card, is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to\nlaw.  Examining these incidents of misconduct in light of the entire record, the Board concludes that\nthe record does not sustain a conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion that it is\n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for him to have a clearance.  Egan, 484\nat 528.  Accordingly, the Board holds that the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision under\nGuideline E is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  In light of this holding, the Board need not\naddress Department Counsel\u2019s remaining assignments of error. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Jean E.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 38-year-old senior engineer employed by a defense contractor.  He had\nnumerous delinquent debts created by frequent trips to visit a dying parent.  He sought financial\ncounseling, entered into payment agreements, paid off several debts, and has made a good-faith\neffort to resolve indebtedness.  He also gave incorrect answers on two security clearance applications\nand gave an investigator a low estimate of the amount actually owed on a former employer\u2019s credit\ncard.  He disclosed the complete background of why he owed this debt.  One security clearance\napplication was 11 years ago and because it was not recent, was not counted against him.  The\nmistake on the latest security clearance application was attributable to government mistake.  He\nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns about financial considerations and personal conduct.\nClearance is granted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated December 6, 2006).\n1\nTr. at 5.\n2\nId. at 10, 17.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 6, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 16, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.\nPending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 19, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on August 3, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on August 28, 2007.  I convened a hearing on September 12, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security\nclearance.  Applicant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of the rule requiring15-days notice of\nthe hearing, because he had actual notice more than 15 days prior to the hearing.   The government\n2\noffered twelve exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-12.  Applicant offered eleven exhibits, marked as\nExhibits A-K.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.)\non September 20, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant denied the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.f., 1.g., 2.a., 2.b., 2.c.,\nand 2.d.  He admitted all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 38-year-old senior engineer employed by a defense contractor.   He is married\n3\nand has two children.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics, and is currently a second year\nevening law student.  He served in the U. S. Marine Corps (USMC) from February 1991 until\nFebruary 1994, when he left the service due to herniated lumbar discs.  His official discharge form\n\nAnswer to the SOR, dated February 16, 2007, at 11.\n4\nId. at 18-27.\n5\nApplicant has a payment plan agreement with the creditors denoted in the table..\n6\nSee also Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L (Release of Title Lien, dated February 27, 2007).\n7\nTr. at 46-47.\n8\n4\nDD 214 indicates an honorable discharge.   In April 2005, he joined the Army National Guard.  He\n4\nattended officer candidate school (OCS).  However, the National Guard was told he could not be\npromoted to an officer upon completion of OCS training because he had received an other than\nhonorable (OTH) discharge from the USMC.  The matter is currently under review.  He is waiting\nfor his commissioning to second lieutenant (2LT) pending the outcome of this review.  He has held\na security clearance since 1997.  \n5\nApplicant has numerous financial delinquencies best illustrated in the following table:\nSOR \u00b6\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS\n# of PAYMENTS\nTRANSCRIPT PAGE\n1.a.\n$84\npaid\n39\n1.b.\n$2,823\npay plan\n8 at $250/month\n40\n6\n1.c.\n$1,436\npay plan*\n3 at $100/month\n40-41\n1.d.\n$9,093\npay plan*\n3 at $187/month\n42-43\n1.e.\n$3,033\npay plan*\n1 at $100/month\n44\n1.f.\n$112\npaid\n45\n1.g.\n$5,424\npaid\n45-467\n1.h.\n$56,996\npay plan\n3 at $800/month\n46-47\n1.i.\n$3,387\npay plan*\n3 at $100/month\n48-49\n1.j.\n$3,000\nsame as 1.i.\n50\n1.m.\n$2,498\nsame as 1.d.\n42-43\nSubparagraphs with an asterisk (*) after the words \u201cpay plan\u201d indicate that the payment plans are\ncurrently under abeyance because of the school loans set out in subparagraph 1.h.  Applicant has an\narrangement with the school loan  creditor to pay $800 per month for nine months.  He has paid three\nmonths so far.  At the end of the nine months, the creditor will allow Applicant to refinance his\nstudent loans.  The creditors in the other pay plans have agreed with this arrangement, and he will\nresume his payments at that time.8\nIn 2001, Applicant used his company credit card for personal expenses and was terminated\nfrom employment.  This matter is the subject of subparagraphs 1.d., 1.l., and 1.m.  Applicant\u2019s\n\nId. at 53-56; Government Exhibit 12 (Personal Subject Interview, OPM Report, dated March 27, 2006) at 1-4. \n9\nId. at 50-53, 58.\n10\nId.  at 58-63.\n11\nGovernment Exhibit 2 (Questionnaire for National Security Positions, Standard Form 86, dated June 6, 1996) at 9.\n12\nGovernment Exhibit 12, note 7, supra, at 1-4; Tr.at 62.\n13\nGovernment Exhibit 11 (Personal Subject Interview, OPM Report, dated November 1, 2005) at 1-3. \n14\nTr.at 11.\n15\nId. at17.\n16\nId. at18.\n17\n5\nmother lived half way across the country, and was dying of cancer.  Applicant used the credit card\nto purchase airline tickets for he and his family to fly to visit his mother six or seven times prior to\nher death in November 2001.9\nFrom and after October 2003, Applicant was late with his rent payments on 29 occasions.\nSOR subparagraph 1.k.  The rent is now current, and he has an arrangement with the landlord to pay\nthe rent in two monthly payments, which avoids late payment status.10\nApplicant and his wife received credit counseling which has taught them how to budget and\nto communicate better with each other about finances.11\nPersonal Conduct\nThe SOR subparagraph 2.a. alleges that the delinquent finances set out in subparagraph 1 are\ndisqualifying conditions under Guideline \u00b6 16.\nApplicant falsified material facts on a standard form 86, executed by him on June 6, 1996,\nin response to \u201cSection 28.  Your financial delinquencies a.  In the last 7 years, have you ever been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?; b. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d  He failed to list seven debts that had become delinquent between 1992 and 1994.   He\n12\ndid not know about the first six and did not remember the seventh.   \n13\nDuring an interview with a Special Agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\non November 1, 2005, he stated that he had only charged $500 on his corporate credit card, whereas\nin truth, he charged nearly $2,000 to $3,000 in personal expenses, and he was at least 120 days\noverdue on paying the account when he was terminated by his employer.   He admitted he owed the\n14\ndebt, he wasn\u2019t sure what the amount was, so he \u201clow-balled\u201d it.   He wasn\u2019t concerned about the\n15\neffect on his security clearance , \u201cbut [it gave me] grave embarrassment and immediately following\nthe interview I regretted the statement.\u201d   He did not bring it to the interviewer\u2019s attention, but at\n16\nthe second interview in March 2006, he did give the agent documents with the correct figures.17\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra, note 1, at 5.\n18\nAnswer to the SOR, note 4, supra..\n19\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A-E (Various Letters from the National Guard Requesting an Upgraded Discharge, various dates\n20\nfrom July 20, 2006 to September 16, 2006.\n6\nOn a security clearance application dated December 6, 2006, in response to \u201cQuestion 17.\nYour Military Record - have you ever received other than an honorable discharge from the\nMilitary?\u201d, Applicant failed to disclose that he had been discharged under other than honorable\nconditions.   Applicant believed that he had an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps.  He had\n18\nsustained two herniated lumbar discs, and his doctors recommended he be discharged.  He apparently\nleft the Marine Corps without making sure that all of his paperwork was in order.  Every time he has\nrequested a copy of his form DD 214 from military personnel records, the form states he received\nan honorable discharge.   To clarify matters, his National Guard unit has requested that the\n19\ndischarge be given an upgrade to a general discharge.20\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n21\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n22\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decides whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n23\n7\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n21\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.22\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.23\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems.  \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\n\n8\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d \nThe government established its case under Guideline \u00b6 19.  Three Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying\nin this case: Guideline \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d Guideline \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and Guideline \u00b6 19(d) deceptive or illegal financial\npractices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account\nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust.  Applicant\nhas a history of not meeting debts, as set forth in the SOR and government exhibits.  He also misused\nhis employer\u2019s credit card for personal expenses.  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guidelines \u00b6 20(a) and\n(e) do not apply.  The debts continued to be delinquent until recently and  there is no basis to dispute\nmost of the indebtedness.  However, Guidelines \u00b6 20 (b), (c), and (d) are at issue.  Applicant did seek\nfinancial counseling, which proved most helpful.  It taught Applicant and his wife how to budget and\nhow to communicate about finances.  His efforts at debt reduction only became serious in 2007.  He\nwas on notice in 2005 that the government had concerns about his financial situation.  He did pay\noff the judgment for rent, his car, and two other small bills.  He established payment plans with six\ncreditors.  One, for his student loans, in the summer of 2007 required him to commence monthly\npayments of $800.  He is still paying the debt on his former employer\u2019s credit card and the new\nstudent loan amount, but has had to put the other four debt payments in abeyance.  In 2001, his\nmother was dying of cancer, and during that summer.  He took his entire family on five or six trips\nto see her.  These expenses are what caused him to use his company credit card.  In hindsight, it was\nnot responsible of him to make the number of trips and to use his company credit card for personal\nexpenses.  His mother\u2019s death is an unforeseen event, and I will not second-guess his motives and\nreasons for wanting to visit his mother under the circumstances.  People do not always act\n\n9\nresponsibly in times of stress, and he did what he thought was right, and I find no fault with his\nmotives.  Using his employer\u2019s credit card without getting permission is bad conduct.  Letting one\u2019s\nchildren have time with a dying grandparent is responsible conduct.  While he still has substantial\ndebt, I believe he has taken sufficient steps and initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve the debts.  This is a very close case.  I find that Guideline \u00b6 20 (b), (c),\nand (d) apply, and I conclude Guideline F for Applicant.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nParagraph 15 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concerns covered by\nthe Personal Conduct guideline.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process. \nThe old adjudicative guidelines for Personal Conduct included as a potentially disqualifying\ncondition any \u201creliable, unfavorable information\u201d involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  That general\nlanguage duplicated other guidelines, such as those for Criminal Conduct or Financial\nConsiderations.  \nThe new adjudicative guideline for Personal Conduct has more limited language, however.\nUnder paragraph 16(c), a disqualifying condition may arise where there is \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination\nunder any other single guideline . . . .\u201d  Paragraph 16(d) applies where there is \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself\nfor an adverse determination. . . .\u201d  (Emphasis added.) \nIn this case, SOR subparagraph 2.a. is the basis for part of the allegations under the guideline\nfor Personal Conduct, which was  the evidence of  misuse of his employer\u2019s credit card, and financial\nindebtedness.  However, each of these possibly could support a basis for disqualification under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).  Thus, none of the evidence raises separate security concerns\nunder the guideline for Personal Conduct.\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 15, of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process.  One personal conduct disqualifying condition is particularly\nrelevant and may be disqualifying in this case.  \nGuideline \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\n\n10\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an\nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative.\nApplicant\u2019s SF 86 in 1996 had incorrect answers to Section 28 about delinquent debts.  He\nalso did not provide the entire amount of the debt owed to his former employer\u2019s credit card, and he\ndid not list an other than honorable discharge on his 2006 SF 86.  Applicant knew he owed a higher\namount, but he could not remember the exact amount so he gave an intentionally low figure.  He had\nan interview with the investigating agents twice, and knew their concerns were about his financial\ndelinquencies.  Yet he did not disclose the true amount to them orally, but did give the agent the true\namount on a document at the second interview in March 2006.  The government established its case\nunder Guideline \u00b6 16 (a) and (b).\nGuideline \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising\nor instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and\ntruthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; or\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nGuideline \u00b6 17 (a-b) do not apply.  Applicant did not make a timely or voluntary disclosure\nof his true amount owed his former employer\u2019s credit card company.  He did provide the amount in\na document given to the DSS agent.  What is important is that he disclosed his improper use of the\ncredit card, that he was fired by his employer, even though the use was in an unusual and stressful\nsituation.  The fact is he did not remember the exact amount.  He guessed at it.  It was too low but\nhe did disclose the series of incidents that caused the debt.  He is paying it off.  On the 1996 SF 86,\nhe did not remember six debts and forgot about one.  It also has been 11 years since he filled out the\nform.  With respect to Question 17 on the 2006 SF 86, he thought he had an honorable discharge.\nWhen he received several copies of documents from official record keepers and each one states\n\u201chonorable discharge,\u201d it is the government\u2019s error and not his.  His National Guard unit has\nrequested the discharge be upgraded to a general discharge.  Guideline \u00b6 17 (c) and (d) are\napplicable.  The credit card issue was disclosed.  The amount was in error.  I consider it a minor error\n\nHonore de Balzac, French novelist (1799-1850).\n24\n11\ncompared to disclosing the improper use and termination by his employer.  I conclude Guideline E\nfor Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant has made substantial progress in getting his finances under control.  He is 38 years old,\nsufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his obligations.\nI considered his age, his education, his employment, and what might motivate him to be less\nthan truthful.  Applicant supplied false answers on a security clearance applications.  This is\nproblematic because candor with the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a\ntrustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse information about himself, then he\nmay be trusted with confidential or classified information.  Applicant admitted to financial problems\nspanning from 2001 until the present.  He has resolved three of the debts.  The remaining delinquent\ndebts are substantial but he has payment plans in place, and he has kept in contact with his creditors.\nHis credit counseling worked.  When most men are approaching middle age, he successfully\ncompleted OCS training.  He was twice as old as some of his fellow trainees.  He has acted\nresponsibly to arrange debt repayment.  He has expressed remorse for his actions and mistakes.  The\nissue that started his financial exigency was the travel to visit a dying parent.  A mistake, but it was\nnot done with any ulterior motives.  He was being a good child and parent, providing his children\na good role model for them to emulate.  \u201cIn intimate family life, there comes a moment when\nchildren, willingly or not, become the judges of their parents.\u201d24\nThe United States has a duty to protect itself from unauthorized disclosures of sensitive\ninformation and place the utmost trust in those persons to whom it grant access to sensitive\ninformation.  Applicant has had his share of problems, but I believe that he has matured, and shown\nthat he can persevere.  The totality of the record raises no reasonable and persistent doubts about\nApplicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and\ndiscretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has a history of juvenile\narrests and traffic offenses from 1994 until 2003. She was convicted in 2003 for harassment due to\na domestic incident. She successfully completed her court ordered classes in anger management and\nprobation. She has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns under criminal conduct, and personal\nconduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an assignment to a sensitive position is granted.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended.\n1\n (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated December 7, 2006 ) at 1-3.\n2\nTr. 28.\n3\n GE 1 (Application for Public Trust Position, dated November 21, 2005 ) at 1-11.\n4\nTr. 32.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 21, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance\nReview Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended ( the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On November 29, 2006, DOHA\n1\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which\nis in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under, Guideline E, Personal\nConduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nIn a sworn statement dated December 7, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2007. A notice of hearing was\nissued on February 21, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 6, 2007. The hearing was conducted\non that date with Applicant waiving the 15 day notice. The Government submitted Government\nExhibits (GE) 1-2, which were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on her\nown behalf, and presented the testimony of her mother-in-law. She offered one exhibit AE A, which\nwas read into the record. At Applicant\u2019s request, the record was held open until March 13, 2007 for\nsubmission of the document that was read into the record at the hearing. Applicant did not submit\nthe copy. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations under Guideline J, and all allegations under\nGuideline E.  Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the\n2\nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a married, 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as a customer\nservice representative. She has three children, ages eight, five and two years.  She completed her\n3\nhigh school general equivalency degree (GED) in 2001. She submitted an application for a position\nof trust in connection with her employment on November 21, 2005.4\nApplicant\u2019s grandparents raised her because her mother did not choose to do so. Applicant\nbelieved her mother was her older sister. Until the age of 13, Applicant believed that her\ngrandparents were her real parents.  When she learned the truth, she was quite upset. During her high\n5\n\nTr. 18.\n6\nTr. 36.\n7\nTr. 30.\n8\nTr. 37.\n9\nTr. 19-20.\n10\nTr. 21.\n11\n4\nschool years, Applicant rebelled against authority. She and her friends engaged in behaviors at school\n(theft, fighting, disorderly conduct) that led to several juvenile arrests.6\nIn 1994, when she was 14 years old, Applicant was charged with shoplifting and false\ninformation. She was found guilty and fined $25. She does not remember any details.  Although, she\n7\nrecalled that she just forgot that the ring was on her finger. In the same month of that year, Applicant\nand her friends saw an open locker in school and one of her friends took things from the locker.\nApplicant did not want to \u201crat out\u201d her friend. Thus, she was charged. She does not remember what\nhappened in that case.  She asked her aunt and grandmother about the incident after receiving the\n8\nSOR, because she could not recall many details.9\nIn 1995, Applicant was late for school one day. According to the class policy, if you were late\nfor class, you had to empty your purse of all contents. The school was concerned that the student was\nlate because they were outside smoking. When Applicant emptied her purse, a small pocket knife\nfell out. She explained she carried the knife with her because she had no home telephone and if she\nneeded to go out and make a phone call at night, she wanted the knife for protection. She forgot that\nit was still in her purse. On November 27, 1995, she was arrested for a concealed weapon, and taken\nto a juvenile detention center for a week.10\nOn October 28, 1996, she was charged with fighting at school. A friend of hers was bullied\nby someone at school, and Applicant \u201cstood up for her friend\u201d and became involved in an altercation.\nShe spoke to the guidance counselor at school prior to the October incident, but the school did not\nintervene. In the school yard, the bully attacked Applicant and they fought. Applicant does not\nremember the disorderly conduct incident in November 1996. Applicant believes that all these\nincidents were not relevant to a public trust determination because they were part of her juvenile\nrecord. She admits they were silly kid stuff.  \n11\nApplicant received her driver\u2019s license at the age of 18. She did not drink and drive, but was\nstopped numerous times for traffic violations: speeding or vehicle safety violations. From 1998 until\n2005, she was stopped eleven times. Several charges from 1999, 2001 and 2003 were dismissed,\nincluding expiration of a license plate, compulsory insurance violation, and seat belt violation.\nApplicant went to court and paid the speeding tickets.\nA June 5, 2003-speeding ticket was amended to a defective headlamp, but carried a fine of\n$190. Also, on June 20, 2003, Applicant was charged with operating a vehicle without a child\n\nTr. 44.\n12\nTr. 23.\n13\nTr. 43.\n14\nTr. 25-26-27; Record of Settlement Agreement read into the record.\n15\n5\nrestraint/safety violation. She was found guilty and fined $56, and related court costs. She explained\nthat the car seat for her four-year-old son was in her husband\u2019s car.12\nApplicant and her husband (common law since 1997) separated in 2003. She was stressed\nand trying to raise her children. Her husband was seeing another woman and lied to Applicant about\nthis situation. Applicant saw her husband in a car with another woman. She left her vehicle and\nconfronted the  other woman. This resulted in an altercation in the middle of the street. Her children\nwere with her in the vehicle. She is not proud of this incident but learned from it.13\nThus, on August 3, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) harassment, (2) assault\n-3  degree and (3) child abuse. Charges (2) and (3) were dismissed. Charge (1) was dismissed after\nrd\nsuccessful completion of a two year deferred sentence, including 90 days jail (suspended), $159 fine\nand 36 sessions of domestic violence counseling. There is no other information concerning this\nincident in her FBI record.\nOn August 8, 2003, Applicant was charged with (1) reckless driving, (2) compulsory\ninsurance, (3) expired plates and (4) failure to display proof of insurance. Charges (2), (3) and (4)\nwere dismissed. However, Applicant was found guilty of careless driving and fined $128, placed on\nsix months probation and sentenced to 24 hours useful public service. She successfully completed\nprobation and public service.\nOn August 20, 2004, Applicant was charged with speeding, compulsory insurance and\ndriving under restraint. She received a deferred sentence for driving under restraint, was fined $78\nand given 100 hours of community service, and five days in jail (suspended). On September 30,\n2004, Applicant was charged with failure to stop. She was found guilty of the amended charge of\nunsafe vehicle and was fined $120. Applicant acknowledged having a \u201cheavy foot.\u201d14\nOn December 21, 2004, Applicant was charged with harassment, but the charge was\ndismissed. This incident was ultimately settled in a mediation. Applicant was employed by a rental\ncar agency. At that time she was still attending the court ordered anger management/domestic\nviolence classes. Her replacement did not come to work on time. Applicant waited until the person\narrived, but then explained that she needed to leave immediately to get to her class. Her supervisor\nwanted to speak to her immediately, and an argument ensued. Her supervisor filed a complaint\nagainst Applicant for harassment. The parties agreed to participate in a mediation in the\nneighborhood justice center. The charge was dismissed after the parties agreed to a settlement. There\nis no court record of this incident.15\nApplicant interviewed for her current position in 2005. She completed an employment\napplication at home. After she was hired, she completed his public trust application on November\n21, 2005. Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 16- Your Police Record (In the last 7 years, have\n\n GE 1 supra, note 4 at 6.\n16\nTr. 58.\n17\nTr. 69-71.\n18\n Tr. 64.\n19\n.\n6\nyou been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)? Leave out traffic fines of less\nthan $150.  She listed her August 8, 2003 conviction for harassment. She did not list the December\n16\n21, 2004 harassment complaint. She did not list it because it never reached court, she had not pled\nguilty, nor did she receive any fines and it was dismissed by a mediated settlement out of court. As\nto the traffic ticket of $190, Applicant did not remember the amounts of the various traffic fines. Her\nexplanations are credible. At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged she completed many employment\napplications and always put down her 2003 charge.  She recalled she called the court at one point\n17\nin time to inquire about dismissed charges that were not on her record. She believed they did not\nneed to be listed on any employment form.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law praised Applicant for her genuine caring for her family and her\nthree children. She has known Applicant for ten years, and shares many family events with\nApplicant, her husband and the three children. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law had a security clearance\nherself and understood the implications of Applicant\u2019s behavior. She described Applicant as patient,\nstable and low keyed. She is in the car when Applicant drives her children to various places. She\nacknowledged that her son and Applicant had a difficult relationship when they were younger. She\nreports they are together and working as a family unit now.18\nApplicant loves her work, and has achieved awards and certificates. Her supervisor\nvolunteered to testify on her behalf and recommend Applicant, but company policy will not allow\nthis.  She has received training in all areas and handles various types of customer requests. She is\n19\nmotivated to continue in this position.20\nApplicant survived a difficult time in her relationship while raising her children. She has\nmaintained steady employment. She and her husband have been reunited for four years and together\nfor a total of ten years. They now own a home. Applicant works hard and hopes to advance her\ncareer. Despite her juvenile record and many traffic offenses, she acknowledged responsibility for\nher immature actions. She completed her probations and her court ordered classes. She is responsible\nin her finances and manages her family.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\n\n Department of the Navy v.

Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are:\nCriminal Conduct - Guideline J: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nPersonal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n22\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n23\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n24\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n25\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n26\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n27\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n28\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence, and after application of the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors, I concluded the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe government has established its case under Guideline J. based on Applicant\u2019s admissions,\nand several documented arrests and conviction for harassment in 2003. Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31 (a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and\nCC DC AG \u00b6 31 (c)  (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) applies.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Applicant\u2019s last conviction\nwas in 2003. Applicant provided evidence to establish some mitigation under Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b632 (a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\nThe majority of the charges are more than ten years old. They were the result of juvenile\nbehavior. The conviction in 2003 was the result of Applicant seeing her husband with another woman\nin public. Applicant successfully completed all court ordered terms and has not been involved in any\nsubsequent incidents for four years. The 2004 incident was an unfortunate mis-communication and was\nmediated. Even counsel conceded that this incident was an unfortunate one. In addition to these facts\nand those stated above, she has satisfactorily performed her job over the past years, which constitutes\nevidence of mitigation under CC MC AG \u00b6 32 (d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement).\nBased on the conclusion, stated below, that Applicant did not deliberately falsify her public\ntrust application, as required under 18. U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1.h are\nconcluded in her favor.\n\n9\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Government alleged in Paragraph 2 that Applicant intentionally falsified her public trust\napplication by failing to disclose her 2004 harassment charge that was dismissed and her traffic ticket\nwith a fine more than $150, which operates as a disqualification under Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16 (a) ( deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant  facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities). Although Applicant\nadmitted that she did not disclose the information, she denied that she did it with an intent to deceive.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)\n(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant credibly explained that she did not disclose the above referenced incidents because\nshe did not think that she was required to list the 2004 dismissed charge and that she did not recall the\namount of the 2003 traffic ticket. She now realizes that she made an error. The Government conceded\nthat her explanation was plausible and I conclude similarly. \nPC DC AG \u00b6 16 (d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined\nwith all available information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information)\nis raised due to Applicant\u2019s history of traffic violations from 1998 until 2005. \nPC MC AG \u00b6 17 (d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\nunlikely to recur) applies in this case. As discussed above and for the reasons articulated under the\nwhole-person analysis, I find in favor of Applicant under the Personal Conduct trustworthiness\nconcern. \n  \nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of national security is the paramount concern. The objective\nof the trustworthiness determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative decision that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\n\n10\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered Applicant\u2019s troubled family history, her ability to reunite with her husband and\nraise three children, her steady employment and good work record. I took into account her testimony\nabout the traffic violations and the fact that she accepted responsibility for them. Although, she has\na history of violations, she has not had any for two years. Her mother-in-law\u2019s testimony regarding\nApplicant\u2019s maturity and ability to be patient with her family is persuasive. I do not believe similar\ncriminal problems will recur in the future, given her awareness of the trustworthiness process and the\nimpact additional incidents would have on her employment. Applicant was under unusual stress during\nher separation. Applicant was forthright and clear in her resolve at the hearing. Applicant has mitigated\nthose security concerns raised by her criminal conduct and personal conduct. Those concerns raised\nunder those guidelines are found in her favor. Accordingly, Guidelines J and E are concluded for her.\nBased on the evidence in the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\neligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1.

Since 2000, she accumulated a\n\nOn August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application\n1\nof revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and\nRegulation, in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  A memorandum from the Deputy Under\nSecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director of DOHA, dated November 19, 2004, states\nDOHA shall utilize provision of the Directive to resolve contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.\n2\nsignificant amount of debts listed in the Statement of Reasons (SOR) that she has neither resolved\nnor paid.  She failed to mitigate the concerns raised by financial considerations.  Eligibility for a\npublic trust position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 4 and September 9, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public\ntrust, an ADP I/II/III position.  On December 7, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nas amended and revised.   The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial\n1\nConsiderations), and detailed reasons why DOHA recommends the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a position of trust should be granted.\nIn an answer received at DOHA on January 4, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  On\nFebruary 12, 2007, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing\neleven Items, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on February 16, 2007.  Applicant received the\nFORM on March 30, 2007, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit material\nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  On May 1, 2007, Applicant submitted additional\ninformation that I marked as Applicant Exhibits (AX) 1-3.  Department Counsel did not object to\nthe submission.  The case was assigned to me on May 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAs to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted all of the debts listed in\nthe SOR, except those noted in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.k.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make\nthe following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 44 years old and single.  From September 1984 until September 1988, she served\nas a seaman with the U.S. Navy.  After leaving the Navy, she worked as a ward clerk for a hospital\nfrom approximately August 1989 to October 2003.  Subsequently, she was unemployed until she\nbegan her current position in May 2004, as a beneficiary service representative for a company that\nadministers health care benefits for the federal government. (Item 4 at 1-2).\nIn October 2006, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories related to her financial\nresponsibility.  In them, she responded to numerous debts and indicated that she lives with her\nmother with whom she shares expenses and pools income. (Item 8). \n\n3\nIn December 2006, the Government filed a SOR and alleged in Paragraph 1(\u00b6 \u00b6 1.a. through\n1.m) that she owed 13 delinquent debts, totaling $30,695.  According to credit reports, dated October\n26, 2004, and November 23, 2005, her delinquent debts began accruing in early 2000.  Applicant\nadmitted that she owed all of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, except four of them, totaling\n$13,930, which she claimed belonged to her mother. (Item 3).  She asserted that she would go to a\nlegal clinic for assistance in resolving her debts and begin making payments by the end of January\n2007. (Id.). In March 2007, she wrote letters to the four creditors, challenging her responsibility for\nthe debts. (AX 1).  According to a request for payment by the creditor listed in \u00b6 1.c, Applicant\u2019s\nmother is the responsible party. (AX  2).  The debt listed in \u00b6 1.e for $840 appears to be Applicant\u2019s,\nper a April 2007 response from Equifax investigations. (AX 3).  Applicant subsequently admitted\nowing the credit card debt listed for $4,679 in \u00b6 1.a. (Id. at 4).  The status of her challenge to the debt\nlisted in \u00b6 1.k for $5,188 is unclear.\nIn response to the FORM, Applicant submitted numerous documents indicating that she was\nin the process of investigating various debts.  However, she did not provide any evidence that she\nobtained assistance for resolving her financial problems or made payments in January 2007 on\nspecific debts, as she asserted she would do in her answer to the SOR.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an administrative\njudge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information\u201d (Guidelines), which set forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC), and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  By recognizing that individual\ncircumstances of each case are different, the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist an\nadministrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to reach a fair, impartial and common sense\ndecision.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n2\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,\n2006)(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of\ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported\nby \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d\nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,\n380 (4  Cir. 1994). \nth\n4\nSince the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final\ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position\nis \u201cclearly consistent with the interest of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn\nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n2\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \u201cAny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved\nin favor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b).  These same burdens of proof apply to\ntrustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\nA person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered all facts in evidence and legal standards, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept,\nand concluded the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\n\n5\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems.  \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d\nTwo Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions could raise a trustworthiness concern\nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 19(a) and (c).  Despite a statement in her answer\nthat she intended to begin paying her delinquent debts in January 2007, she failed to do so, indicating\neither an unwillingness or inability to satisfy them.  According to credit reports, Applicant has a\nhistory of failing to meet her financial obligations since early 2000.  DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has\nconcluded that \u201c[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the\nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified\ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000).\nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions,\nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.\nSix Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e) are\npotentially applicable:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt, which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue;\n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline \u00b6 20(a) does\nnot apply.  Applicant has multiple delinquent debts, which remain unpaid.  Because she has not\naddressed the majority of the debts, she has failed to show that such financial problems are\u201dunlikely\nto recur.\u201d Applicant did not produce any evidence to trigger the application of Guidelines \u00b6 20(b),\n(c), or (d).  Applicant disputed several debts, which constitutes some mitigation under Guideline \u00b6\n20(e).  However, after disputing four debts, Applicant learned that two of them are hers, one belongs\nto her mother, and the fourth is unresolved.  Guideline \u00b6 20(f) does not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\n6\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a).  As noted\nabove, Applicant\u2019s failure to make greater progress resolving her delinquent debts is an ongoing,\nlong-term problem and is sufficiently serious to raise a security concern.  Her financial decisions to\nincur debt that she was unable to repay were voluntary.  She is 44 years old and sufficiently mature\nto be fully responsible for her obligations.  Although she was clearly aware of the problem in\nOctober 2006 when she completed the Interrogatories, she waited until March 2007 to begin formally\naddressing the problem, despite indications that she would start payments in January 2007 and seek\nassistance.  Without an established budget and a track record of consistent financial management\ndemonstrating reliability and good judgment, I am concerned that her financial problems will recur.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all facts and circumstances, in\nthe context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the security concerns raised under\nGuideline F.  She did, however, mitigate the allegations noted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c.  Accordingly,\nGuideline F is decided against her and she is not eligible for a public trust position at this time.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d\u2013m:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After the\nlast arrest, the Applicant admitted that he was an alcoholic, totally abstained from alcohol for almost\nfour years, attended alcohol treatment, established a church-based support network, and evinces a\ncredible intent not to use alcohol in the future.  Adverse inference is overcome.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 8, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 8, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 5, 2007.  The case was received\nby the undersigned on February 8, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on February 16, 2007.\nA hearing was held on March 13, 2007, at which the Government presented nine\ndocumentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 9).  Testimony was taken from the Applicant,\nwho also submitted 24 exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through X).  The transcript was received on\nMarch 23, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 51, married and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks to retain a Top Secret-level DoD security clearance previously\ngranted in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based\nupon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are\nentered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer\nto the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.  The Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations\nin the SOR.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol consumption).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that\nthe Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses intoxicants to excess.\n\n3\nThe Applicant has had a serious alcohol abuse problem for many years.  He began drinking\nalcohol in about 1969.  The usage increased over time and eventually resulted in the Applicant being\narrested three times for alcohol related driving offenses.  The last arrest occurred in July 2003.  The\nApplicant has been abstinent since the last arrest.  (Transcript at 23-27.)\nThe first arrest occurred on April 23, 1992.  The Applicant was involved in a serious\nautomobile accident, which resulted in his being injured.  The Applicant was not the direct cause of\nthe accident, but the Highway Patrol report states that his drinking may have contributed to it.\n(Government Exhibit 8 at 26.)  The Applicant had been drinking before the accident, but refused to\ntake any alcohol tests.  While the Highway Patrolman felt that the Applicant was under the influence,\nit is impossible to know the level, if any, of his intoxication.  He was charged with Driving Under\nthe Influence of Alcohol (DUI) and Reckless Driving.  He plead Nolo Contendere to Reckless\nDriving and was sentenced to a fine and three years probation.  He also was ordered not to drink and\ndrive.  This last requirement he failed to follow during his probation.(Transcript at 27-29.)\nAs a result of the above arrest, the Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for a period\nof time.  In 1995, the Applicant was stopped by police and charged with Speeding/Reckless Driving,\nDriving with a Suspended Driver\u2019s License due to a Previous DUI Conviction and Driving Without\na Valid License.  According to the Applicant, his license was no longer suspended at the time of this\narrest, but he had not obtained a new one.  He obtained a valid license to show the court, where he\nalso pled guilty to the Speeding/Reckless Driving charge and Nolo Contendere to Driving Without\na Valid License.  He paid a fine for these offenses.  (Government Exhibit 9, Transcript at 30-32.)\nThe Applicant was arrested a second time for DUI on August 19, 1998.  An employee at a\nrestaurant reported the Applicant to police because this person felt the Applicant to be intoxicated.\nThe police stopped him and the Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Driving with a\nBAC of greater than .08%.  He was found guilty and received a fine, jail time and five years\nprobation.  He was also required to complete a drinking and driving course, and have an ignition\ninterlock device installed on his car.  (Transcript at 32-35.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s third arrest for DUI occurred on July 25, 2003.  The Applicant had a\nblackout while drinking and driving, crashed through a fence, almost hitting a person and wound up\nin a farmer\u2019s field.  He was charged with DUI, a probation violation and Assault With a Deadly\nWeapon (his vehicle).  He pled guilty to the DUI and probation violation.  The sentence included a\nfine, jail time (electronic monitoring), a requirement that he attend an 18 month drinking and driving\ncourse, not consume alcohol or visit bars or liquor stores, and his drivers license was suspended for\n15 months.  He also received five years probation, due to end in October 2008.  (Transcript at 35-37.)\nThe Applicant has had nothing to drink since July 25, 2003, a period of almost four years.\nImmediately after his last arrest, the Applicant spent a weekend contemplating his life and\nwhat he should do.  At the end of that weekend he entered residential treatment for alcohol abuse.\nHe was able to attend treatment for about three weeks.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  At that time the\nApplicant became extremely ill and was hospitalized with a potentially fatal condition.  He was in\na medically induced coma for 13 days, eventually recovered after several weeks in the hospital, and\nsubsequently had months of rehabilitation.  (Transcript at 36-40.)\n\n4\nThe Applicant did not return to treatment.  Rather, he turned to his church for help.  While\nhe had attended church for several years on a casual basis, his near-death experience evidently acted\nas a wake-up call for him.  His wife, brother, other church members and the church hierarchy all\nsubmitted statements discussing the profound changes that have occurred in how the Applicant views\nhis life, religion and drinking.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E, F, G, J, U, W and X.)  \nThe Applicant has found that the church\u2019s bible study classes, mens group and other activities\nto be more useful to him than attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous or similar support groups.  The\npeople at church, many of whom know about his problem, help him be \u201caccountable\u201d and avoid\nalcohol in his life.  He further testified that he has no desire for alcohol and evinces a credible intent\nnot to return to drinking in the future.  (Transcript at 21-23, 42-50.)\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant is very respected at his job.  He submitted laudatory letters from several senior\nmilitary officers, as well as civilian employees of the military, who have worked with the Applicant\nover the years.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C, D, I and V.)  The Applicant\u2019s job entails working\nclosely with these officers to ensure their safety, the safety of others, as well as that of important\npieces of Government equipment.  These people, with knowledge of the Applicant\u2019s history,\nemphatically state that the Applicant is trustworthy, reliable and worthy of having access to classified\ninformation.  \nOf particular import is the letter from the officer who was the Applicant\u2019s commander at the\ntime of the last incident.  He discusses at great length how and why he made the decision not to\nreplace the Applicant at his job.  This retired officer states that, \u201cAs a Commander, it was one of the\nbest decisions I ever made.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit V at 5.)  \nThe record also shows that the Applicant\u2019s employer also appreciates how he conducts\nhimself on the job.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L, M, N, O, P and T.)  He is described by his supervisore\nas a \u201ctop notch\u201d employee who is \u201calways on time and rarely misses work.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nH.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\n\n5\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of a criminal nature and alcohol abuse that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has abused alcohol, and been involved in three  alcohol related criminal incidents\n(Guidelines G and J).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The\nevidence shows that, since he entered treatment in 2003, the Applicant has eliminated alcohol\nconsumption.  He has created and followed a church-centered self-help program that allows him to\nmaintain sobriety.  The Applicant has not successfully completed a recovery program, and he does\nnot attend a \u201ctraditional\u201d support group, such as Alcoholics Anonymous.  However, for the following\nreasons, I find that this can be overcome.  The Applicant has been completely abstinent from alcohol\nfor almost four years as of the date of the hearing.  The Applicant's compelling testimony shows that\nhis alcohol abuse is a thing of the past, that he is very open about his prior struggle with alcohol, and\nthat he is fully capable of continuing to abstain from alcohol.  He is extremely remorseful for his\nalcohol abuse, as well as his alcohol related criminal convictions.  He has a good employment record\nand is extremely involved in his community, as set out at length above and in the record.\nWith regards to his alcohol abuse, the following Disqualifying Conditions apply: (a) alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; (c) habitual or binge consumption\nof alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as\nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; (d) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; and (g)\nfailure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence.\nHowever, the record supports the application of the following Mitigating Conditions, which\nare sufficient to support the Applicant\u2019s position: (a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and (b) the\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol\ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\nTurning to the concomitant Criminal Conduct allegations, the following Disqualifying\nConditions have application in this case: (a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (d)\nthe person is currently on parole or probation; and (e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to\ncomplete a court-mandated rehabilitation program.\n\n7\nThe record in this case also supports the application of the following Mitigating Conditions,\nwhich provide support for the Applicant being granted a security clearance.  They are: (a) so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution,\njob training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\nIn addition, application of the General Factors is appropriate and supports a decision in the\nApplicant's favor.  The Applicant is motivated to continue his sobriety (factor 7); he shows\nconsiderable evidence of rehabilitation (factor 6); there is little or no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation or duress (factor 8); and, under the circumstances of this case, the probability that the\nApplicant will return to his drinking ways are virtually nil (factor 9). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of\nthe Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

On January 30, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 19, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 30, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued\non May 4, 2007, scheduling the hearing for June 5, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2007.\nRULINGS ON EVIDENCE AND PROCEDURE \nA Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons was granted to correct the spelling of\nApplicant\u2019s first name. \nThe Government offered eight exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 8, and admitted without objections.

The\nreduction was suspended for six months.  \n3\nApplicant had a government travel card while in the military. The travel card was only\nauthorized for use on official government travel. Applicant received Article 15 punishment in about\nDecember 2002, for making unauthorized withdrawals with his government travel card.  \n4\nApplicant was discharged from the military in May 2004, for unsatisfactory performance.\nApplicant testified he was discharged because he was unable to pass a test. He received an Honorable\nDischarge.  \n5\nApplicant was unemployed for a period after he was discharged from the military. He also\nworked a few temporary jobs. He worked for a government contractor for about one year. The\ncompany\u2019s contract with the U.S. Government expired. Applicant obtained a job with another\ndefense contractor. He has worked for his current employer for almost two years.6\nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR, to all the debts listed in the SOR, with the\nexception of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He provided explanations and further information, which will\nbe addressed below. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a in the amount of $52, is for a cable bill. Applicant testified he is\nattempting to obtain the account number for this debt, as a box of paperwork was lost by the movers\nwhen he moved.7\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b in the amount of $144, is to a utility company. This debt is still\noutstanding. Applicant testified he is attempting to address the largest debts first, by making payment\narrangements, and then moving to the smaller debts.8\nOn May 18, 2007, Applicant contracted with a credit relief company to assist him in\nmanaging his debt. The agreement calls for Applicant to pay the company a service fee of $2,539,\nstarting with three initial monthly payments of $258. He will then make 14 monthly service fee\npayments of $125. In return, the credit relief company will negotiate with Applicant\u2019s creditors for\na settlement of his debts. The contract lists Applicant\u2019s total unsecured debt at $16,929, for six\ncreditors. The estimated settlement amount is $6,771. Applicant\u2019s estimated minimum monthly\npayments would be $258 per month, which Applicant would deposit in his bank for direct payment\nto his creditors.

The contract clearly states that Applicant pays his service fee to\nthe company, but the \u201cCLIENT WILL MAKE ALL SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS DIRECTLY\nTO CREDITOR.\u201d Applicant has not yet utilized any credit counseling available through this\ncompany. Applicant estimates his total indebtedness at almost $30,000.9\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c in the amount of $1,339, is for a loan that went to collections in about\nJanuary 2005. Applicant submitted an e-mail of June 5, 2007, stating that he has made 14 straight\npayments of $150 per month, without missing or being late on a payment since he entered an\nagreement to pay $150 per month until paid. The balance as of June 5, 2007, was $222.10\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d in the amount of $1,772, is to a cell phone company. The credit bureau\nreport (CBR) of July 29, 2005, lists the date of Applicant\u2019s last activity on this account as January\n2004. Applicant testified this debt is included in his contract with the credit relief company under\nthe name of a collection agency.11\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e in the amount of $185, is for cable services. SOR \u00b6 1.f lists a debt of\n$16 owed for a dishonored check. SOR \u00b6 1.g lists a debt of $132 owed to a utility company. These\nthree debts were incurred while Applicant was in the military, and are all still outstanding.12\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h in the amount of $3,091, became delinquent in about April 2004. This\ndebt is included in the contract with the credit relief company.13\nApplicant disputes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i in the amount of $863, for telephone services. He\nstates he never had an account with this company. He testified he called the company, but they could\nnot find his name in their records. This debt is listed on the 2005 credit bureau report (CBR), but not\nthe two most recent reports.14\nApplicant disputes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j in the amount of $290. This is a debt to an apartment\nfor damages to their carpet.

Both were incurred while Applicant was in the military, and both\nare still outstanding.16\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m in the amount of $1,137, is a debt to a bank from before Applicant\nleft the military. Applicant testified he planned on calling the creditor the day after the hearing.17\nWhile Applicant was in the military, he owned and was making payments on two vehicles.\nWhen he left the service he was unable to maintain the payments on both vehicles, and one of the\nvehicles was repossessed. He borrowed money from his parents and in-laws, became current on his\nloan, and recovered the vehicle. Applicant eventually fell behind on payments again and the car was\nrepossessed for the second time in about January 2006. Applicant currently owes about $6,100 on\nthis debt. This debt is included in the contract with the credit relief company.18\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP),\nsigned on July 12, 2005. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to Section 27b, which asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have\nyou had your wages garnished or had any property repossessed for any reason?\u201d Applicant also\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to Sections 28a and 28b, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180\ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nApplicant denied he intentionally falsified the e-QIP. He testified he did not obtain a copy\nof his credit report before filling out the questionnaire. He stated he moved a couple times after he\nwas discharged from the service and he lost track of his bills. He said he did not list the repossession\nbecause he recovered the vehicle, so he did not consider it a repossession.  I find this to be a\n19\nreasonable explanation for why Applicant did not list the repossession, and I find Applicant did not\nintentionally falsify his response to Section 27b. However, Applicant clearly knew he had a number\nof delinquent debts when he submitted the e-QIP. After considering all the evidence, and gauging\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility, I find Applicant intentionally falsified his responses to\nSections 28a and 28b.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n20\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\n\nId. at 527.\n21\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n22\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n23\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n24\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n25\n7\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n21\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n22\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n23\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n24\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n25\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\n\n8\nobligations) apply in this case. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt. Most of his debt\nremains unpaid. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), and FC MC 20(e) (the individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue).\nApplicant has accrued numerous unpaid debts. He has current financial problems. FC MC\n20(a) does not apply. Applicant had a period of unemployment after he left the service in 2004,\nwhich is potentially a condition that was largely beyond his control. However, Applicant\u2019s financial\nissues began before he left the service. Additionally, he has worked for his current employer for\nalmost two years, and has done very little to pay his debts. I do not find that Applicant acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. FC MC 20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant has made payments on only one of the debts. The great majority of the money is\nstill owed. Applicant very recently contracted with a credit relief company to assist him in managing\nhis debt. Applicant has not yet availed himself of any of their counseling services. It appears the only\nentity guaranteed to benefit financially from this contract is the credit relief company. They will\nreceive $2,539 from Applicant. Applicant still is required to pay the creditors directly. Applicant\u2019s\nonly benefit is if the company negotiates a settlement amount. The contract also does not call for any\nof Applicant\u2019s creditors to be paid until after the credit relief company receives the initial three\nmonthly payments of $258. Applicant has not done enough to establish a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and there is no clear indication that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control. FC MC 20(c) and FC MC 20(d) do not apply. I find FC MC 20(e)\napplicable to the disputed debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant was discharged from the military by reason of unsatisfactory\nperformance. Applicant states he was discharged because he was unable to pass a test. He received\n\nISCR Case No. 05-03472 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2007). \n26\n9\nthe highest discharge possible, an Honorable Discharge. I do not find this to have any adverse\nreflection on Applicant\u2019s character or conduct. SOR \u00b6 2.c is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his e-QIP by not listing the\nrepossession of his car. Even if it is assumed this answer was incorrect, that is not dispositive of the\nissue of Applicant\u2019s falsification, since the mere proof of an omission or an incorrect answer,\nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission\nor incorrect response occurred.  I find Applicant\u2019s explanation that he did not consider this to be a\n26\nrepossession since he recovered the vehicle, to be reasonable under the circumstances. SOR \u00b6 2.d\nis resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant intentionally failed to list his financial delinquencies on his security clearance\nquestionnaire. This raises two Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC). They are PC\nDC 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) and PC DC 16(e) (personal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . ).\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct in the military constituted violations of the UCMJ. These are\ncriminal acts, which could have been alleged under Guideline J. I find Applicant\u2019s actions in the\nmilitary support a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. PC DC 16(c)\n(credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information) and PC DC 16(e) are established.\nI have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) and I especially\nconsidered PC MC 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts), PC MC 17(b) (the refusal or\nfailure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the\nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully),\nPC MC 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent,\nor it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), PC MC 17(d) (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive\nsteps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or\nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), and PC MC 17(e) the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation,\n\n10\nor duress). Applicant has not submitted sufficient credible information to establish any of the\nmitigating conditions.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant\u2019s military record clearly has some positive aspects, but it was marred by his\nmisconduct, including an incident of shoplifting, which led to his receiving nonjudicial punishment.\nDespite his two incidents of punishment under the UCMJ, Applicant received an Honorable\nDischarge. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt, which is mostly still unpaid.\nApplicant provided intentionally false information about his finances on a security clearance\nquestionnaire. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the\nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns based on his financial issues and personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 21, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  The Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision.\nAs to Guideline G, the Judge\u2019s factual findings included the following: Applicant was\narrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) four times\u2013in 1971, 1984, 2000, and 2005.  He was\nfound guilty the first three times.  After the arrest in 2005, the charge was dismissed because the\narresting officer did not appear, but the state administratively revoked Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license\nfor two years\u2013until March 2008.  Applicant has abstained from alcohol in the past, but currently\nconsumes alcohol at a moderate to low level.1\nApplicant objects to the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant does not believe he has a problem\nwith alcohol.  Applicant points to portions of his hearing testimony,  as well as a cover letter he\n2\nsubmitted with evidence he was allowed to submit after the hearing, in which he acknowledged he\nhad an alcohol problem.  The Judge is not required, as a matter of law, to accept Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony.  Rather, the Judge has to consider Applicant\u2019s statements in light of the record evidence\nas a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0005 at 3 ( App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2000).  Moreover, during\nanother part of his testimony,  Applicant denies having a problem with alcohol. The Board finds no\n3\nerror on this issue.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in not applying all of the Guideline G mitigating\nconditions to his case.   \u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d\n4\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once\nth\nthe government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nestablish mitigation.  Directive E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigation conditions\ndoes not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.\n\n3\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  Even if the Judge had found some\nevidence of mitigation in this case, that alone would not have compelled the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as\na whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  The Judge considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions and discussed why he did not apply them in Applicant\u2019s case.  The\nJudge explained why the evidence Applicant presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome\nthe government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29,  2005).\nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuideline G is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\n   \n \nSigned: Michael Y.

During the 2005\nincident, his level of intoxication was tested twice with results of .226 and .243, although he disputes\nthe validity of those results. The 2005 incident concluded when the court dismissed the charge\nbecause the arresting officer did not appear to testify. But the state administratively revoked his\ndriver\u2019s license for two years until March 28, 2008. Applicant has abstained from alcohol in the past,\nbut he is currently consuming alcohol at a moderate to low level. Applicant did not present sufficient\nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the alcohol consumption security concern. Eligibility for\na security clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nNovember 17, 2006. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the\nfactual basis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline G for alcohol consumption\nand Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification). \nApplicant timely replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. In his written response to the\nSOR, Applicant admitted the six allegations under Guideline G, but he denied the two falsification\nallegations under Guideline E. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated November 17, 2006, which is after the\neffective date. The applicability of the Revised Guidelines was made a matter of record at the start\nof the hearing (R. 12\u201315). \nThe case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued\nscheduling the hearing for April 11, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript on April 19, 2007.\n\n3\nThe record was kept open until May 31, 2007, to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission, and those matters were\nforwarded to me by department counsel who voiced no objections to the post-hearing exhibits. Those\nmatters are described and admitted as follows: \n\u2022\nExhibit E\u2013a two-page cover letter from Applicant with two enclosures. This first enclosure\nis a letter summarizing his participation in an alcohol-treatment program during 2000\u20132002.\nThe second enclosure is an order of revocation informing Applicant that the court sustained\nthe department of licensing action revoking his driver\u2019s license for two years until March 28,\n2008.\n\u2022\nExhibit F\u2013the court order dismissing the 2005 DUI charge. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, I find that the following facts are true:\n1.\nApplicant is a 59-year-old senior engineer seeking to retain a security clearance. His job\ninvolves providing engineering and management support for submarine overhauls at a Naval\nshipyard. He was married in 1981, and his divorce was finalized in 2005. He is the father of four\nchildren, ages 25, 23, 21, and 19. \n2.\nHis employment history includes more than 20 years of honorable military service in the U.S.\nNavy. He was commissioned an officer in 1969, and he retired as a commander (pay grade 0-5) in\n1991. He served onboard submarines during his first ten years of service. He then converted to an\nengineering duty officer, and he was sent to the Navy\u2019s postgraduate school where he earned a\nmaster\u2019s degree in electronic engineering. He then served in a series of assignments, including\nacquisition and submarine repair. He held a security clearance at the secret and top-secret levels.\nSince retiring from the active military service, he has worked as a contractor employee supporting\nthe Navy in maintenance and modernization of submarines. Applicant is a highly regarded,\nrespected, and trusted employee by people who work with him (Exhibits B, C, and D). \n3.\nApplicant has a history of consuming alcohol, at times to excess or to the point of\nintoxication. He started drinking alcohol as a young man, and his drinking increased while in the\nNavy. The high point was probably in 2000, when he was arrested and charged with his third offense\nof driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). His history of alcohol consumption includes two\nblackouts, and he admits that his drinking was one of the causes of his divorce (R. 66, 56\u201357). His\ndrinking has resulted in four alcohol-related incidents involving law enforcement.\n4.\nIn 1971, Applicant was charged with DUI. He pleaded guilty and paid a $100 fine. \n5.\nIn 1984, he was charged with DUI (Exhibit 2). Initially, he pleaded not guilty, but later\nchanged his plea to guilty. The court\u2019s sentence included three years of probation, about $860 in\nfines, fees, and court costs, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted for 90 days. After this incident was\nresolved, Applicant abstained from alcohol for about two and a-half years. \n6.\nFor his first job as a contractor employee, Applicant completed a security-clearance\napplication in May 1991, a few months after his retirement from the Navy (Exhibit 3). He disclosed\nhis 1971 and 1984 DUI offenses in response to the relevant questions. \n\n \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d\n3\n4\n7.\nIn 2000, he was charged with DUI. He was arrested on a Saturday morning at about 11:00\na.m. after binge drinking in reaction to a situation with his spouse (R. 76\u201377). He petitioned for and\nwas granted a deferred prosecution under certain conditions. The court ordered him to pay an $875\nfine, make restitution of $93, undergo alcohol assessment and treatment, submit to an ignition\ninterlock for two years, and serve probation for five years.\n8.\nAs required by the terms of the deferred prosecution, Applicant received outpatient treatment\nat a chemical dependency center (Exhibit E at enclosure 1). During 2000\u20132002, he completed the\ntwo-year program at the center successfully. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, although there\nis no evidence about who made the diagnosis. According to a letter from the center, Applicant\u2019s\nattendance was almost perfect, he was a role model for other clients, and he was in compliance with\nthe entire treatment program. \n9.\nIn September 2005, Applicant completed and signed a security-clearance application for a\nperiodic reinvestigation. When he signed the application, he certified that his statements were true,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and were made in good faith. Also, he\nacknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished under federal law. In\nresponse to Question 23d  about his police record, Applicant responded in the affirmative and\n3\ndisclosed the 2000 DUI offense. He did not disclose the 1971 and the 1984 DUI offenses. In\naddition, he disclosed his alcohol-related treatment during 2000\u20132002 in response to another\nquestion. In response to Question 14/15 about his relatives and associates, he listed his mother,\nfather, and sister as required, but he did not list any of his children, which was also required.\n10.\nIn October 2005, the court dismissed the DUI charge against Applicant based on completing\nthe deferred prosecution program. About two months later in December, Applicant was arrested for\nand charged with DUI. According to Applicant, he had consumed one 16-ounce beer with a meal,\nand he was stopped by a police officer within a few minutes after leaving the restaurant while driving\nhome (R. 79\u201380). He was taken to a police station and his level of intoxication was tested twice by\nusing a Breathalyzer machine. The results were .226 and .243, although Applicant disputes the\nvalidity of the results. Likewise, he does not believe he was intoxicated. He retained legal counsel\nwho sought to suppress evidence (Exhibit F). At the motions hearing in July 2006, the police officer,\nwho was now employed by another police agency in a distant state, did not appear. The court\ndeclined to exercise its discretionary authority to obtain the presence of the police officer. Instead,\nthe court dismissed the DUI charge without prejudice. \n11.\nAlthough his criminal case was resolved favorably, the state took administrative action\nagainst Applicant (Exhibit E at enclosure 2). On March 28, 2006, the state department of licensing\nrevoked his driver\u2019s license for two years. With assistance of counsel, Applicant appealed the\nrevocation alleging numerous errors (Exhibit 7 at 8\u201311). In May 2007, the court heard Applicant\u2019s\nappeal and sustained the two-year revocation for his 2  Administrative Per Se incident. He is eligible\nnd\nto have his driver\u2019s license reinstated on March 28, 2008. He is now eligible for an occupational\ndriver\u2019s license (Exhibit A), but has elected not to apply for it. \n12.\nIn November 2006, Applicant responded to interrogatories from the department (Exhibit 7).\nIn response to questions about alcohol, he indicated that he was currently drinking alcohol (beer and\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n5\nwine) in moderation. He estimated the frequency as biweekly and the amount as a combination of\ntwo beers or two glasses of wine or one of each in the evening. He denied drinking to the point of\nintoxication. Also, he was asked why he omitted his 1984 DUI arrest in response to Question 23d\nof his security-clearance application. He explained it was an oversight on his part, because he failed\nto read the question completely thinking that the scope of the question was limited to 15 years. He\nwas not asked why he omitted his 1971 DUI arrest. Nor was he asked why he did not list his children\nin response to Question 14/15. \n13.\nApplicant does not believe he has a problem with alcohol (R. 65\u201366). He continues to drink\nbeer and wine because he enjoys the taste. He has reduced his level of consumption since responding\nto the interrogatories in November 2006 (R. 109\u2013110). He probably drinks a beer or a glass of wine\nabout once a week (R. 58\u201359). He currently attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) periodically,\nalthough he is not working the 12-step program and he does not have a sponsor. He stated that he\nlearned two lessons from attending the alcohol-treatment program (R. 108). The first lesson was that\nhe could drink and get away with it, which he did not want to do. The second lesson was that\nalthough complete abstinence was advocated, in some borderline cases it was okay to drink alcohol\nso long as you paid attention to what you were doing.  \nPOLICIES\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n4\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n5\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n6\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n7\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n10\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n6\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n8\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n10\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n11\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E addresses issues of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations. In this regard, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material\nfact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security\nclearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and\nwillfully. An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported.\nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to two questions on his 2005 security-\nclearance application. Both allegations are resolved in his favor.   \nThe first allegation is that he deliberately failed to disclose his 1971 and 1984 DUI offenses\nin response to Question 23d. Applicant contends this happened due to an honest mistake about the\nscope of the question. His explanation is accepted as credible. In reaching this conclusion, I rely, in\npart, on the government\u2019s evidence, the 1991 security-clearance application (Exhibit 3), wherein\nApplicant reported the 1971 and 1984 DUI offenses. His disclosure of those matters in 1991, coupled\nwith his disclosure of his 2000 DUI arrest and his alcohol treatment in 2005, shows that he was\nmaking a good-faith effort to report his history of alcohol-related offenses and was not trying to\nconceal them. \nThe second falsification allegation accuses Applicant of deliberating concealing or omitting\nhis children in response to Question 14/15 and makes reference to his divorce proceedings. Applicant\nmaintains this was the result of an honest mistake he made when he completed the on-line\n\n7\napplication, because he had no reason to hide the fact he had children. Indeed, he had previously\ndisclosed his children on his 1991 security-clearance application. At bottom, this falsification\nallegation has no merit because the government has not established his deliberate intent to mislead\nor conceal this particular information. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant.  \n2.\nThe Alcohol Consumption Security Concern\nThe general concern under Guideline G is that excessive alcohol consumption often leads\nto the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses. It can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s\nfour DUI arrests and his history of alcohol use and treatment for the same. I reviewed the DCs under\nthe guideline and conclude that three apply. Each DC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first DC\u2014alcohol-related incidents away from work\u2014applies. His four DUI arrests and\nthe consequences he suffered as a result are ample evidence of alcohol-related incidents that raise\na security concern.\nThe second DC\u2014alcohol-related incidents at work\u2014does not apply. There is no evidence\nthat Applicant has reported to work or duty under the influence of alcohol. Indeed, the evidence\nsuggests Applicant is a capable employee (Exhibits B, C, and D). \nThe third DC\u2014habitual or binge consumption of alcohol\u2014applies. Applicant admits that his\n2000 DUI resulted from a binge-drinking episode in reaction to a situation with his ex-wife. Also,\nhe also admits two episodes of blackouts, which is further evidence of heavy drinking to the point\nof intoxication.\nThe fourth DC\u2014diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol abuse or\nalcohol dependence\u2014does not apply. In response to SOR subparagraph 1.d, Applicant admits he was\ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent during his treatment in 2000\u20132002. But there is no evidence showing\nthe qualifications of the individual who made the diagnosis, and I cannot assume it was made by a\nduly qualified medical professional. \nLikewise, the fifth DC\u2014evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u2014does not\napply. Again, there is no evidence showing the qualifications of the individual who made the\ndiagnosis. \nThe sixth DC\u2014relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an\nalcohol-rehabilitation program\u2014applies, but with diminished weight. In response to SOR\nsubparagraph 1.d, he admits he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent during his treatment in\n2000\u20132002. And the evidence shows he resumed drinking in 2005 after completing the deferred\nprosecution program in October 2005. His resumption of drinking in light of the dependence\ndiagnosis is viewed as a relapse, but I give it less weight because there is no evidence showing the\nqualifications of the individual who made the diagnosis.\n\n8\nThe seventh DC\u2014failure to follow a court order\u2014does not apply. There is no evidence\nshowing Applicant violated a court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or\nabstinence. \nThe three applicable DC raise a serious concern about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information. Taken together, they show questionable judgment, and they raise questions\nabout his reliability and trustworthiness. In particular, his well-established record of drinking-and-\ndriving suggests that he believes the rules of the road do not apply to him.\nTurning to the evidence in mitigation, I reviewed the MCs under the guideline and conclude\nnone apply. Each MC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014does not apply. The record evidence\nshows a pattern of behavior resulting in adverse consequences, and the most recent was his fourth\nDUI arrest in 2005, a few months after completing the deferred prosecution program. And he is still\nsuffering the consequences from that arrest as shown by the revocation of his driver\u2019s license. This\npattern is not mitigated by passage of time without recurrence, infrequency, or as an isolated\nincident. \nThe second MC\u2014the individual acknowledges his alcoholism, provides evidence of actions\ntaken, and has established a pattern of abstinence\u2014does not apply. Despite his history of alcohol\nconsumption and the problems it has caused him, he believes he does not have an alcohol problem\n(R. 65\u201366). Given that statement, the MC cannot be applied in his favor. \nThe third MC\u2014the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program and has no history of previous treatment or relapse\u2014does not apply. Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of treatment in 2000\u20132002 followed by a return to drinking in 2005 militates against applying\nthis MC.     \nThe fourth MC\u2014the three-part reform and rehabilitation condition\u2014does not apply because\nApplicant fails the second and third parts of the MC. He has not demonstrated a pattern of abstinence\nas shown by his return to drinking in 2005, which continues to date. And he has not received a\nfavorable prognosis from a qualified individual. \n3.\nConclusion\nI have also considered the record evidence in light of the whole-person concept and conclude\nthe disqualifying evidence outweighs the mitigating evidence. I reach this conclusion based on his\nwell-established history of drinking-and-driving resulting in four DUI arrests. In addition, his\nsuccessful treatment during 2000\u20132002, followed by a return to drinking in 2005, followed by his\nfourth DUI arrest in 2005, speaks volumes about the likelihood that he will continue to put himself\nin a position where he is involved in alcohol-related incidents. It is apparent that he is not interested\nin abstinence. And the fact that the state has elected to revoke his driver\u2019s license also militates\nagainst eligibility for a security clearance. In other words, as the state is unwilling to entrust him with\nthe privilege of a driver\u2019s license until March 2008, that suggests that the federal government should\nnot entrust him with the privilege of access to classified information. \n\n9\nTo sum up, it appears Applicant lacks insight into his use of alcohol and the problems it has\ncaused him. His lack of insight is problematic, because it means he may once again make a foolish\ndecision to drink-and-drive. Accordingly, Guideline G is decided against Applicant. \nAfter weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude that Applicant has failed\nto explain, extenuate, or mitigate the alcohol considerations security concern. Likewise, he has not\nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline G:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On May 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).1  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 4, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2007. The \nNotice of Hearing was issued on August 24, 2007, convening a hearing on September \n26, 2007. On September 5, 2007, Applicant requested a postponement to a date not \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n March 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nearlier than October 24, 2007. I granted a delay and rescheduled the hearing for \nOctober 16, 2007 (Tr. 23). The hearing was convened as rescheduled.  \n \nThe Government presented two witnesses and 49 exhibits, marked GE 1-49. \nGEs 1-41 are substantive exhibits. GEs 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18 were admitted over \nApplicant\u2019s objection. GE 42 (comprised of eight documents) was considered for \nadministrative notice purposes. GEs 44-47 were admitted over Applicant\u2019s objections for \nthe limited purpose of rebuttal. I gave GEs 44-47 little or no weight since they are agent \nsummaries of interviews conducted by government investigators and neither the \ninterviewees nor the interviewer testified at the hearing. I gave GE 49 no weight since it \nis an opinion/conclusive memorandum.  \n \nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and presented two witnesses and 12 \nexhibits, marked AE A-L. (Most of these exhibits are comprised of numerous tabs with \nseveral documents under each tab. The following documents were admitted over \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s objections: (1) AE A, two page document entitled \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] \nLegal Defense Fund;\u201d (2) AE B, at Tab 8, a letter dated Aug. 23, 1993 and its attached \naffidavit; (3) AE C, at Tab 12, a two page unsigned, handwritten letter, addressed \u201cTo \nwhom it may concern;\u201d (4) AE C, at Tab 13, a letter dated Nov. 12, 1990, and a letter \nsigned by [J.L.B]; and, (5) AE C, at Tab 16, Applicant\u2019s letter dated May 25, 1991. The \nfollowing documents were not admitted: (1) AE B, Tab 4, to the first two pages \n(unsigned, undated notes allegedly prepared by then Applicant\u2019s trial attorney); (2) AE \nB, at Tab 7, the polygraph results; (3) AE C, at Tab 14, a one page document entitled \n\u201cIn the High Court of Justice Chancery Division;\u201d (4) AE D, Tab 17, the last one-page \ndocument signed by [J.G.]. \n \nI kept the record open until October 31, 2007, to allow Applicant time to submit \nadditional matters. He timely submitted AE K and L. AE L was admitted over the \nGovernment\u2019s objection.

It \nbegins at the yellow tab identified as \u201cDetailed Rebuttal \u2013 Import/Export Case\u201d). The \nrecord closed on October 31, 2007. Applicant submitted Appellate Exhibit 4 on \nNovember 10, 2007, and it was not considered. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nOctober 31, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 4, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, with explanations. He denied all the remaining SOR \nallegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of all evidence of record, including his demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old aeronautical engineer. He received a Bachelor of \nScience degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering in 1968. He completed \nhis Master\u2019s of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1973, and his Master\u2019s in \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nBusiness Administration in 1975. He started his doctorate studies but stopped short of \ncompleting his thesis due to work considerations. He does not have a Ph.D. (Tr. 10-11).  \n \nAfter college, Applicant worked for several defense contractors and received \naccess to classified information at the secret level from around 1968 to 1984, and from \n1987 to 1990. Applicant married his wife in 1966, and they have three adult daughters, \nages 36, 33, and 23. \n \nIn 1984, Applicant was enticed to leave an important position with a major \naerospace defense contractor to accept an attractive employment offer from a large \ninternational corporation (IC) (a privately held, foreign corporation with a headquarters \nin the United States), which was also a major U.S. defense contractor (Tr. 164-165). IC \nwas primarily engaged in the design, manufacture, sales and brokering of sales of \nmedium to high technology, electronic military equipment and systems for domestic and \ninternational customers.  \n \nWhen Applicant was hired in 1984, IC\u2019s president/owner told him that IC was \nworking covertly but legally in a highly classified program with a government agency to \nsupply a foreign country (FC) with defense components (Tr. 165).2 Applicant was \ndirected to keep secret his knowledge of the export program and that he would have \nneither access to nor involvement on that part of IC\u2019s business. Applicant claimed that \non several occasions he met with and was debriefed by government agents concerning \nthe FC. Because of these meetings, Applicant believed IC had secret U.S. government \nauthorization to import/export to FC defense components (Tr. 170-173).  \n \nFrom 1984 to 1986, Applicant was the Vice President of an IC subsidiary (ICT), \nand the President of ICT from 1986 to March 1987. He was demoted in March 1987, but \ncontinued to work for IC. In his capacities at ICT, Applicant supervised the international \nmarketing of weapons as well as weapons programs for IC and headed a missile \nprogram. This program contemplated the sale to another foreign country (FC2) of an FC \nanti-armor missile upgraded with U.S. components and technology. The missile \nprogram was to be portrayed publicly as the sale by IC of a European developed missile \nsystem. There is no evidence as to whether Applicant or his company ever applied for \nthe required licenses. IC was to receive a 35% commission on a contract expected to \nbe valued at $300 to $500 million.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Criminal Trial in U.S. District Court and Appeal \n \nApplicant knew that the import or export of defense articles and services to and \nfrom FC required a U.S. government license or written authorization (GE 29).3 In 1985, \n \n2  AE B, Tab 1 (letters dated December 1992 and January 1993, from IC\u2019s owner and director \ncorroborate Applicant\u2019s testimony). \n \n \n3  In the 1960s, the United States prohibited the sale of items for use in combat or training by the \nmilitary or police to FC. In the late 1970s, U.S. law prohibited the import or export of military articles \nwithout a license or written authorization. In the mid 1980s, an Executive Order barred the importation \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant asked two government agencies to sponsor the importation of FC\u2019 missiles \ninto the United States, but both agencies refused (Tr. 268-272).4 Applicant and IC did \nnot request the permits and licenses required to import the missile dummies. Instead, \nApplicant attempted to avoid the U.S. law provisions by importing the missile dummies \nthrough another country. \n \nPrior to shipping the missiles to the United States, Applicant consulted with \ngovernment experts and several lawyers (Tr. 283), who advised him that if there was a \n\u201cvalue-added\u201d to the missiles in a country different than FC, the missiles then would be \nlegally considered as originating from the country where the additional value was added \n(Tr. 268-269, 283).5  \n \nFC\u2019s missile dummies were shipped to another country (FC2), where they were \nsubstantially modified (value was added).6 In 1986, Applicant imported FC\u2019s missile \ndummies and parts for the purpose of conducting platform fit and safety tests (Tr. 165) \nas if FC2 was the country of origin. Applicant established the validity of the \u201cvalue-\nadded\u201d concept through statements made by a former Commissioner for the U.S. \nCustoms Service and a former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) \nDirector (AE B, Tab 4). \n \nApplicant testified he never intended to violate U.S. law and that he was innocent \nof the conspiracy charges. He had a good-faith belief that the missiles were properly \nclassified as originating from FC2, and as such, the importation of the missiles was not \nin violation of U.S. law. \n \nConcerning the exportation of missile components (munitions parts) to FC, \nApplicant claimed he was never involved with that aspect of IC\u2019s operation (Tr. 277), \nand that had a good-faith belief that IC had U.S. government authorization to do so. He \nbased his good-faith belief on representations made to Applicant by his boss (the \nPresident of IC (G), and the leader of the alleged conspiracy, about IC\u2019s work with a \ngovernment agency, and IC having U.S. government\u2019s approval for the exportation of \nparts to FC (Tr. 170-173). G also provided Applicant a letter stating that Applicant had \nno knowledge of, and was not involved in any of the offenses for which he (G) was \nconvicted, that G never discussed any of the conspiracy issues with Applicant, and that \n \ninto the United States of defense articles and services originating from FC. In October 1986, additional \nU.S. law prohibited the import of defense articles and manufacturing data from FC, and the export of \ndefense articles and technology to FC. \n \n4  See AE B, Tab 2; and Detailed Rebuttal documents, TAB 19, last page. \n \n5  See AE B, Tab 4. The value added concept provides that: \u201cwhen multiple countries have \nprovided components for an article that is to be imported into the United States, if the last country of \nexport has substantially transformed (an increase of 35% in labor and material costs to the pre-\ntransformation value of an object) the article in question, then that country and the manufacturer in that \ncountry are properly designated as the country of import and manufacturer for Customs purposes.\u201d  \n \n6  Tr. 289, AE B, Tab 4. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s position did not require him to be involved with the conspiracy (AE B, Tab 1). \nApplicant also presented a letter from IC\u2019s Vice-President (convicted conspirator) stating \nApplicant had no knowledge of and was not involved in the conspiracy to violate U.S. \nlaw (Tr. 305; AE B, Tab 6, summary of interview dated Nov. 16, 1999). \n \nApplicant was acquitted of the conspiracy to provide missile flight technical \ninformation to FC corporations. Applicant had ordered the wind tunnel testing of FC\u2019s \nmissile dummies. However, he had specifically instructed subordinates not to disclose \ntechnical data to FC personnel and not to allow FC personnel to participate in the \ntesting (Tr. 300-305, AE B, Tab 6; GE 30). Another IC employee confessed to providing \nFC with the results of wind tunnel testing conducted in the United States (Tr. 297, AE B, \nTab 5, [B\u2019s] statement, dated Nov. 18, 1992). \n \nIn October 1989 and April 1990, Applicant started cooperating with government \nprosecutors investigating IC\u2019s conspiracies (Tr. 496).7 At the time of these interviews, \nApplicant believed he was a cooperating witness in the conspiracy to violate U.S. law \nand fraud investigations and did not expect to be indicted (GE 42)8.  \n \nDuring the same period, however, Applicant was audited and became the subject \nof a tax fraud/evasion investigation concerning his income tax returns for tax years \n1984-1987. Applicant did not ask for immunity to provide information or testimony \nconcerning IC\u2019s conspiracy to avoid U.S. laws or fraud investigation. However, he asked \nfor immunity concerning any possible tax fraud/evasion charges in exchange for his \ntestimony in the IC conspiracy and fraud prosecution. \n \nIn 1991, Applicant was indicted and charged with three conspiracy counts. In \nDecember 1992, Applicant was convicted of the first count which alleged a conspiracy \nto violate U.S. law by aiding FC to evade U.S. law by exporting U.S. missile \ncomponents to FC, and by aiding in the illegal importing of dummy missiles from FC to \nthe United States for testing and evaluation. Count two was dismissed by the \ngovernment before trial. Applicant was acquitted of count three - the illegal exportation \nto FC of technical data and information derived from U.S.-based flight testing of missiles \noriginally produced in FC. In July 1998, Applicant was sentenced and later served \napproximately 24 months\u2019 incarceration. \n \nIn August 2002, Applicant\u2019s conviction was vacated and set aside because of \nineffective assistance of counsel. His trial attorney failed to investigate, interview, and \ncall witnesses favorable to Applicant\u2019s defense at trial. The government elected not to \nprosecute him again.  \n \n \n7  IC had created numerous fictitious (shell) companies for the purpose of inflating the number of \ncontracts and sales, and making IC look larger and more profitable than it was (Tr. 433-434). Applicant \nwas not involved in these fraud allegations. His evidence suggests he refused to participate in the fraud. \n \n8  See United States v. Jasin, NO. CR. A. 91-602-08 (E.D.Pa.) at 35-40 (August 8, 2002). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant started working for a defense contractor in April 2003. He was granted \ninterim access to classified information at the secret level in April 2004. His access was \nwithdrawn in May 2007 pending the adjudication of the security concerns outlined on \nthe current SOR (Tr. 571). \n \nAllegations of Tax Fraud \n \nApplicant was charged in August 1995 with a count of tax evasion in violation of \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 and one count of filing a false tax return in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n7206(1) (SOR \u00b6 1(b)). Both counts were dismissed by the government in November \n1995, because the statute of limitations had lapsed. Applicant alleged these charges \nwere brought against him by federal prosecutors as leverage to force him to testify \nagainst IC personnel involved in the conspiracy to violate U.S. law and corporate fraud, \nand to force him to plead guilty of the conspiracy charges (Tr. 180, 277) . \n \nSOR \u00b6 2(a) also alleged Applicant intentionally filed fraudulent income tax returns \nfor tax years 1984 to 1987. The Government\u2019s evidence established that from 1984 to \n1987, Applicant received yearly income between approximately $150,000 and \n$300,000, filed his income tax returns, and paid no income tax for tax years 1984 to \n1987.  \n \nThe Government contended that during the alleged tax years, Applicant evaded \npaying taxes by filing false Schedules Cs (depreciation) and Es (business deductions) \nwith his income tax returns; that Applicant falsely claimed to be involved in real estate \nventures and construction business using several fictitious companies to deduct \npersonal expenditures for the remodeling and/or renovation of his residence and to \navoid the payment of taxes. Specifically, the Government tried to establish that \nApplicant falsely included in his Schedule C depreciation expenses for a vehicle (Jeep) \nowned and depreciated by his employer and given to Applicant for his use and that he \ndepreciated three additional vehicles he owned by claiming they were used by him and \nhis family to conduct business for his fictitious companies. \n \nAfter reviewing several Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit reports challenging \nApplicant\u2019s tax filings for 1984-1987, and excerpts of Applicant\u2019s tax returns for the \nsame years, the Government\u2019s expert witness could not determine from these \ndocuments whether Applicant illegally avoided paying taxes or whether he filed \nfraudulent income tax returns (Tr. 100-113). However, the Government\u2019s witness opined \nthat if Applicant\u2019s companies were fictitious and/or if Applicant depreciated vehicles that \ndid not belong to him, then any income tax returns claiming business expenses incurred \nby the fictitious companies and/or the depreciation of vehicles or things used in the \nbusiness of the company were fraudulent.  \n \nApplicant claimed that his state law allowed him to do business using fictitious \ncompany names.9 He stated he speculated in real estate on his spare time with the help \n \n9  AE C, Tab 11. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nof several of his family members, including his parents, wife, daughters, and his \ndaughter\u2019s friends (Tr. 309, 458-459). He claimed the vehicles he depreciated were \nused by him and his family to search for possible investment properties (Tr. 471-476). \nApplicant introduced several statements of people who knew him and that lived close to \nhis residence, to show he was involved in the construction business and real state \ninvestment. He presented some evidence to corroborate his assertions (Tr. 318; AE C, \nTab 11, 13). \n \nApplicant claimed that from 1985 to 1987, he considered his residence an \ninvestment property, and that he had his residence for sale on several occasions. He \nintroduce pictures of his residence with posted \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs, to show he attempted \nto sell it. He explained that as the director of an international company (ICT), he always \nexpected to relocate either to London or Washington, D.C. (Tr. 315-316).10  \n \nApplicant purchased his residence in April 1985 (GE 8), and has lived in it since \nthen. Applicant\u2019s residence is located on a corner lot. He used two different addresses \nto identify the same property. He used one address to identify his home of residence. \nHe used the second address (the cross street address) to identify the address of \nseveral of his fictitious companies, his rental property, and the place where he stored \nconstruction materials for his businesses (Tr. 449, 467).  \n \nIn his 1984-1987 income tax returns, Applicant depreciated his residence, as if it \nwas a rental or investment property, using the cross street address to distinguish his \nrental property from his residence. Applicant explained he had divided his residence into \ntwo separate living structures, and that he rented one side of his residence to his \nbrother (Tr. 468). In the same return, he claimed mortgage interests paid, presumably \nfor the rented property. He could not explain how he arrived at the mortgage interest \nclaimed in his income tax returns (Tr. 448).  \n \nExcept for two real estate contracts Applicant signed made in July 1984 and \nMarch 1985 (GE 6 and 7, respectively) for the purchase of lots of land to build a house, \nand the purchase of his residence, Applicant presented little evidence to show that \nduring the period in question he owned, rented, or entered into any contracts for the \npurchase of real estate property. During the same period, Applicant performed \nextensive renovations and repairs on his residence while living on it (Tr. 450-456). \nExcept for his testimony, Applicant presented no evidence to show he divided his \nresidence into two dwellings. He presented no business records, employee records, or \ndocumentation of expenses for his fictitious companies. His evidence is insufficient to \nshow that any of his fictitious companies conducted any bona fine business activity to \nsupport his depreciations and deductions.  \n \n \n10  Included in AE C, Tab 12, are statements corroborating Applicant\u2019s testimony that IC was \nlooking into establishing an office in Washington, D.C. However, IC, the parent corporation of Applicant\u2019s \ncompany, was headquartered and located in the same county and state where Applicant purchased his \nhome. Applicant lived five miles away from his place of work. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nRegarding the Jeep he depreciated, Applicant claimed he originally purchased \nthe Jeep, that his employer reimbursed him the value of the vehicle (they promised him \na company car), and that later he bought the vehicle back from his employer. He \nclaimed he paid his employer using a personal check. Applicant presented no \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate his claims (Tr. 460-461). \n \nThe attorney who represented Applicant in the August 1995 tax evasion/fraud \ncharges testified at Applicant\u2019s hearing. He claimed informing federal prosecutors that \nthe stature of limitations had lapsed before the government filed the tax charges, to no \navail. After the income tax charges were dismissed, the government opened a civil \ninvestigation and audited Applicant\u2019s income tax returns for tax years 1984 through \n1997. After the completion of the investigation, no further tax liability, interests, or \npenalties were assessed against Applicant, and no additional civil or criminal charges \nwere filed against him for tax law violations (Tr. 409-423, AE K, letter dated Oct. 29, \n2007). \n \nUnder the IRS Code, there is no statute of limitations for filing a false or \nfraudulent return with the intent to evade tax liability. Although the criminal charges \nagainst Applicant were dropped because of the expiration of the statute of limitations, \nthe government could have assessed civil tax liability against Applicant if they could \nhave established he filed false or fraudulent returns to avoid tax liability.11 Applicant has \nalways filed income tax returns. \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2(b), Applicant denied he engaged in expense account fraud \nwhile working for IC, or for IC\u2019s successor corporation (FI).12 Applicant claimed he was \nremoved as President of ICT because he refused \u201cto cook\u201d ICT\u2019s books, and to give a \nforeign country equipment that it was not authorized under U.S. law (Tr. 368-369). \nApplicant explained that when FI took over IC\u2019s organization, FI refused to honor \nApplicant\u2019s employment contract and cancelled Applicant\u2019s employment benefits \npackage. Applicant sued FI for breach of contract, and around February 1990 FI \ncounterclaimed by accusing Applicant of expense account fraud to force him to \nwithdraw his suit (Tr. 485).  \n \nIn general, the expense account fraud allegations were that Applicant submitted \nfraudulent receipts to justify travel and/or business expenses he did not incur or were \nnot \nauthorized. \nApplicant \nestablished \nhis \njob \nentailed \nworking \nclassified \ncompartmentalized activities which sometimes involved foreign nationals. For security \nreasons, IC did not allow its employees to identify customers by name, country of origin, \nor the project in which they were involved in their business expense reports. Instead, \nemployees were asked to keep separate diaries for review by supervisors, and to use \nfictitious names to conceal identities (Tr. 359-368; AE D, Tab 18). To recover for \nexpenses incurred during his classified business trips, Applicant substituted personal \n \n11  Internal Revenue Code \u00a7\u00a7 6501(c)(1), (2), and (3) (1986); Treasury Reg. \u00a7 301.651(c)-1. \n \n12  IC was acquired by FI, another foreign corporation doing business in the United States. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nreceipts for the actual receipts of expenses incurred during classified business meetings \n(Tr. 482, 511).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence showed the alleged fraudulent trips and business expenses \nwere valid business trips and the expenses were authorized by his supervisors (AE D, \nTab 18, 19). The evidence of record is not sufficient to establish by substantial evidence \nthat Applicant did engage in expense account fraud.  \n \nFalsification Allegations \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2c (1), (2), and (3), and \u00b6 2d alleged Applicant falsified his answers to \nquestions 40 and 21 of his April/July 2004 SF 86. Question 40 asked whether in the last \nseven years he had been a party to any public civil court actions not listed elsewhere in \nhis application. Applicant disclosed one civil action he brought against his trial attorney, \nbut failed to disclose that his former employer (FI), filed a civil action against him in \nOctober 1988 which went on until at least September 2002. He also failed to disclose a \n1996 civil action filed against him by an investment company which was closed in May \n1997, and a civil action he filed against an investment company in October 1996, which \nwas dismissed in December 1997.  \n \nQuestion 21 of Applicant\u2019s April/July 2004 security clearance application asked \nwhether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offenses. The \nquestion required Applicant to disclose information regardless of whether the record in \nhis case had been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record. Applicant disclosed his \n1991 charges and conviction for the conspiracy to violate U.S. laws, but failed to \ndisclose he was charged with income tax evasion and fraud in August 1995. \n \nWhile completing his 2004 SF 86, Applicant was uncertain about how to answer \nthe questions because his conspiracy conviction was vacated and set aside, and the tax \ncharges were dismissed. Applicant sought legal advice from the attorney (a former \nAssistant U.S. Attorney) currently representing him on a malpractice suit against his \nformer trial lawyer. Applicant\u2019s attorney advised him that: (1) his conspiracy conviction \ndid not exist, and that he did not have to disclose it; (2) he did not have to disclose the \nthree civil actions in question because the initial actions for these suits were filed \noutside of the period asked in the questions; (3) he did not have to disclose his 1995 \ncharges for tax evasion and fraud because they were dismissed, and as such they were \na \u201cnullity\u201d and did not exist (AE E, Tab 21, Tr. 392-406). Applicant followed his \nattorney\u2019s advice and did not disclose the information (Tr. 515-516).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2e alleged that in September 2006, Applicant made a false statement to \nthe DOHA adjudicator handling his case by sending the adjudicator an e-mail stating \nthat \u201c[he] have never been accused of wrongdoing during [his] life in the 45 years before \nor the 16 years after this dispute.\u201d The government contended Applicant\u2019s statement \nwas false because it made reference only to his 1991 conspiracy charges, and failed to \ndisclose his former employer\u2019s 1990 expense account fraud allegation.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s e-mail in its pertinent paragraph reads as follows: \u201cI believe it useful \nfor you to know that all these issues are related to an alleged import violation in the \n1985 timeframe (20 years ago!). It was a dispute that went on for many years resulting \nin my family and I being subjected to horrendous pressure by prosecutors because I \nwould not give them a plea bargain. I could not agree to plead guilty to something I did \nnot do. In the end, after a very difficult and long struggle, my innocence was recognized \nby the court. I was exonerated. The conviction was overturned and the indictment was \ndismissed. Please be aware that I have never been accused of wrongdoing during my \nlife in the 45 years before or the 16 years after this dispute.\u201d (GE 41). \nApplicant considered the 1990 expense account fraud allegations, the 1991 \nconspiracy charges, and the August 1995 tax fraud/evasion charges, part and parcel of \nwhat he referred in his e-mail as \u201cthese issues\u201d and \u201cthis dispute.\u201d He was referring to \neverything that happened during the period he worked for IC (Tr. 384-385). I find that \nthe conspiracy charges, the tax evasion/fraud charges, and the expense account fraud \nallegations are temporally interrelated, are connected to Applicant\u2019s employment to IC, \nand involved substantially the same prosecutors.13  \n \nDOHA\u2019s adjudicator had several telephone conversations with Applicant prior to \nreceiving the e-mail in question (Tr. 151-152). During those telephone conversations, \nApplicant discussed his tax indictment and some other litigation that the adjudicator \ncould not recall during his testimony. The adjudicator testified it was possible that during \none of those conversations Applicant mentioned to him the expense account fraud \nallegations. Having observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony for two days, I \nnoticed he provides elaborate and lengthy responses to questions. It would be easy for \nthe adjudicator to miss the nuances and details of his explanations. I do not believe the \ne-mail was submitted with the deliberate intent to mislead the adjudicator. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified he always intended to do everything legally (Tr. \n287). He had access to classified information from 1968 to 1984, from 1987 to 1990. \nFrom April 2003 to May 2007, he held interim access to classified information. There is \nno evidence he has been involved in any security violations. He averred that except for \nthe incidents alleged in the SOR, he has had an impeccable record.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s references are impressive.14 His witnesses included, two former \nAssistant U.S. Attorneys, and he presented statements by people who have held senior \npositions in the U.S. government such as a Secretary of State and White House Chief of \nStaff, a senior director of an important government agency, a rear admiral and associate \nadministrator of an important government agency, and a general officer. Some of his \n \n13  See United States v. Jasin, No. CR.A. 91-602 at 35-40 (E.D. Pa.) Aug. 8, 2002. Considering \nthis decision together with Applicant\u2019s evidence it seems as if the tax charges were filed as leverage to \nsecure Applicant\u2019s testimony. \n \n14  AE B, Tab 5, letter dated August 23, 1993; AE C, Tab 14, affidavit dated Sep. 30, 2007; AE D, \nTab 17, letter dated October 3, 2007; Tab 18, letter dated November 1, 1993; AE F, Tab 22 and 23; and  \nAE H (character letters). \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                          \nreferences have known Applicant for over 20 years. They described his on and off duty \nperformance both before and after the incidents alleged in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant was described as a patriot, invariably honest, completely trustworthy, \nand of high integrity. His references and friends assess him as loyal, conscientious, and \nresponsible. He has an excellent reputation as an extremely hard-working and \naccomplished business man, dedicated father and husband, and U.S. citizen. \nApplicant\u2019s references consider him a highly qualified senior manager with unique skills \nwho has made invaluable contributions to his employers and his country. His witnesses \nand documentary evidence recommend him for a security clearance without \nreservations.  \n \nFor many years, Applicant has also been involved in community and \nphilanthropic work including, flying search-and-rescue missions as a volunteer pilot for \nthe Civil Air Patrol, and providing disaster relief with the American Red Cross, the \nChristian Relief Effort, and Lend A-Hand organizations (Tr. 387, AE G). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.15 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The \nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, \nwhich are to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d16 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n15  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n16  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n12 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 1991 three count indictment on a conspiracy to violate U.S. laws, his \n1992 conspiracy conviction for illegally importing prohibited items from a foreign country \n(FC), and his 1995 charges for filing false income tax returns and tax evasion raise \nsecurity concerns under Criminal Conduct disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation \nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally \ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n \nIn 1992, Applicant was convicted of one conspiracy count, acquitted of another \ncount, and the third count was dismissed prior to trial. In 2002, his 1992 conspiracy \nconviction was vacated and set aside because of ineffective assistance of counsel. \nAdditionally, in October 1995, the August 1995 income tax fraud and evasion charges \nwere dismissed.  \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \nApplicant averred he never intended to violate U.S. law.17 He claimed he is \ninnocent of the conspiracy charges for several reasons: (1) He had a good-faith belief \nthat IC has working on the importation of the items with the approval of a U.S. agency \n(based on his boss\u2019 assertions); (2) his meetings with government agents concerning \nFC corroborated his boss\u2019 assertions; and, (3) the legal counsel and advice he received \nfrom government export experts and corporate counsel indicating IC was using legal \nmethods to import the items without the required license (value-added concept). \nApplicant established he relied on incorrect legal advice he received from his \ngovernment export experts and several corporate legal counsels, his value-added \nscheme involved a lawful method of circumventing U.S. law.18 \n \n \nConcerning the 1995 tax evasion and false income tax return charges, the \nevidence established that from 1984 to 1987, Applicant received yearly income between \napproximately $150,000 and $300,000, filed his income tax returns, and paid no income \ntax. The Government\u2019s evidence raised serious questions about Applicant\u2019s business \nand accounting practices, including the questionable depreciation of his residence, a \nvehicle apparently owned by Applicant\u2019s employer, and business deductions and \ndepreciations for fictitious companies he was operating from his home. The rental of half \nof his residence, the storing of construction materials for his businesses at his home of \nresidence, and the depreciation of three other vehicles he owned also raised income tax \nconcerns. \n \n \nApplicant presented little evidence to corroborate his claims that he had bona \nfide business activity to support his business depreciations, and deductions i.e., he \npresented no business records, employee records, documentation of expenses for his \nfictitious companies, or business transacted during the alleged period. Furthermore, he \npresented no evidence to corroborate his claim that he divided his residence into two \ndifferent dwellings, or that he rented half of his residence. Some of the supporting \ninformation he never created, other evidence he could not be located because the tax \nallegations were 20 years old and he could not find it. \n \n \nApplicant strongly denied filing false income tax returns to evade tax liability. His \n1995 income tax related charges were dismissed because the statute of limitations had \nlapsed. Federal prosecutors then opened a civil investigation and audited Applicant\u2019s \nincome tax returns from 1984 to around 1997. After the investigation was completed, no \nfurther tax liability, interests, or penalties were assessed against Applicant, and no \nadditional civil or criminal charges were filed for tax violations. Department Counsel\u2019s \ntax expert witness testified at the hearing that he could not conclude from the \ndocumentary evidence presented that Applicant had filed fraudulent income tax returns \nwith the intent to avoid tax liability. There is no statute of limitations for filing false or \n \n \n17  Applicant knew U.S. law prohibited the importation of defense items from FC without United \nStates authorization, and there is no evidence that he ever asked for the required U.S. license to import \nthe items.  \n \n18  See page 4. \n\n \n14 \n \n \n                                                          \nfraudulent income tax returns with the intent to evade tax liability. The government\u2019s \n1984-1997 civil investigation/audit apparently found insufficient evidence of false or \nfraudulent tax returns or tax evasion.19 Applicant has consistently filed his income tax \nreturns, and there is no evidence of any further questionable tax behavior. Considering \nthe record as a whole, I find Applicant did not commit the offenses. \n \n \nMoreover, I find any remaining criminal conduct security concerns mitigated \nunder AG 32(a): \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d AG 32(c): \n\u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense;\u201d and AG 32(d): \u201cthere is evidence \nof successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s questionable behavior occurred 20 years ago and there is no \nevidence of additional criminal activity. Applicant\u2019s behavior related to the conspiracy to \nviolate U.S. laws happened under such unusual circumstances that I find it is unlikely to \nrecur. His questionable income tax returns, business and accounting practices are also \ntemporally remote. Available evidence suggests that since 1984-1987, Applicant has \nfiled his income tax returns properly, and has not engaged in similar questionable \nbehavior. Based on Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I believe he has learned his \nlesson from his past mistakes, and similar questionable behavior is unlikely.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s impressive references commented favorably on his employment \nrecord and unconditionally recommend he receive access to classified information. He \nhas also shown constructive community involvement. On balance, Applicant has \nmitigated the criminal conduct security concern. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG & 15.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2a alleged Applicant intentionally filed fraudulent income tax returns to \navoid tax liability for tax years 1984-1987. This allegation was considered and \nadjudicated together with the 1995 tax fraud and evasion charges discussed above \nunder the criminal conduct guideline, and incorporated herein.  \n \n \nAs previously discussed, the Government\u2019s evidence raised serious questions \nabout Applicant\u2019s business and accounting practices, including the questionable \n \n19  I considered in my analysis that there could have been many reasons why the IRS elected not \nto proceed on a civil action against Applicant, and that in a security clearance adjudication the standard of \nproof is \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d \n\n \n15 \n \n \ndepreciation of his residence, a vehicle apparently owned by Applicant\u2019s employer, and \nbusiness deductions and depreciations for fictitious companies he was operating from \nhis residence, the rental of half of his residence, the storing of construction materials for \nhis businesses at his home of residence, and the depreciation of three other vehicles he \nowned. \n \n \nApplicant presented little documentary evidence to corroborate his claims that he \nhad bona fide business activity to support his business depreciations, and deductions. \nHe explained some of the supporting information he never created (business records), \nother records were not produced because the tax allegations were 20 years old and he \ncould not find the documents.  \n \n \nAfter federal prosecutors dismissed the 1995 income tax related charges (the \nstatute of limitations had lapsed), they opened a civil investigation and audited \nApplicant\u2019s income tax returns from 1984 to around 1997. The civil investigation \nresulted in no further tax liability, interests, or penalties assessed against Applicant, and \nno additional civil or criminal charges were filed for tax violations. Department Counsel\u2019s \ntax expert witness (IRS agent) testified he could not conclude from the documentary \nevidence presented at the hearing that Applicant had filed fraudulent income tax returns \nwith the intent to avoid tax liability.  \n \n \nThere is no statute of limitations for filing false or fraudulent income tax returns \nwith the intent to evade tax liability. Apparently, the government\u2019s 1984-1997 civil \ninvestigation/audit found insufficient evidence of false or fraudulent tax returns or tax \nevasion to bring a civil action against Applicant. Applicant has consistently filed his \nincome tax returns since 1984-1987, and there is no evidence of any further \nquestionable tax behavior. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raised concerns under AG \u00b6 16(c): \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(d)(3): \u201ca pattern of rules violations.\u201d \n \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find that AG \u00b6 17(c): \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(f): \u201cthe \ninformation was unsubstantiated,\u201d apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s questionable income tax returns, business and accounting practices \noccurred 20 years ago and there is no evidence of additional questionable behavior. His \nbehavior is so temporally remote that I find it no longer cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Available evidence suggests that since 1984-\n\n \n16 \n \n \n1987, Applicant has filed his income tax returns properly. Based on Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor and testimony, I believe he has learned his lesson from his past mistakes, \nand similar questionable behavior is unlikely.  \n \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2b, the record evidence shows that in 1990, Applicant\u2019s prior \nemployer accused him of expense account fraud after Applicant filed suit for breach of \nemployment contract. Applicant explained he was removed as ICT president for \nrefusing to cook ICTs\u2019 books and give a foreign country items it was not permitted to \nreceive under U.S. law. Applicant\u2019s evidence show that many of the specific incidents \nalleged as unauthorized expenses were approved or sanctioned by IC personnel as \nproper business expenses. Balancing the evidence available, his explanations are \ncorroborated by the evidence of record. The evidence did not establish by substantial \nevidence that Applicant engaged in expense account fraud. \n \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2c and 2d, Applicant falsified his SF 86 when he failed to \ndisclose in his answer to SF 86 question 40 that he had been party to three civil suits, \nand in his answer to question 21 that he was charged with income tax evasion and \nfraud in 1995. AG \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire;\u201d applies. \n \n \nApplicant conclusively established his omission was caused by the improper \nadvice of his legal counsel who was specifically advising him on how to complete the SF \n86. Applicant should not have followed his attorney\u2019s improper advice. Notwithstanding, \nhe clearly relied upon his legal counsel\u2019s improper advice, -- a former Assistant U.S. \nAttorney with significant credentials that enhanced the credibility of his erroneous legal \nadvice. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(b) applies. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2e alleged that in 2006, Applicant made a false statement to the DOHA \nadjudicator handling his case by sending the adjudicator an e-mail stating that \u201c[he] \nhave never been accused of wrongdoing during [his] life in the 45 years before or the 16 \nyears after this dispute.\u201d The Government alleged the statement was false because \nApplicant had been accused in 1990 by his then employer of expense fraud account.  \n \n \nApplicant explained that when he used the term \u201cthis dispute\u201d he meant to \ninclude all the related incidents that surfaced out of his period of employment for IC. I \nfind that the conspiracy charges, the tax evasion/fraud charges, and the expense fraud \naccount allegations are temporally interrelated, and connected to Applicant\u2019s \nemployment to IC. I also find the conspiracy charges and the tax charges involved \nsubstantially the same prosecutors, and that the tax charges may have been filed as \nleverage to secure Applicant\u2019s testimony.  \n \nDOHA\u2019s adjudicator had several telephone conversations with Applicant prior to \nreceiving the e-mail in question. During those telephone conversations, Applicant \ndiscussed his tax indictment and some other litigation that the adjudicator could not \nrecall during his testimony. The adjudicator testified it was possible that during their \nconversations Applicant mentioned to him the expense account fraud allegations. \n\n \n17 \n \n \n                                                          \nHaving observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony for two days, I noticed he \nprovides elaborate and lengthy explanations. He likely provided many details about his \nlegal problems that are not included in the e-mail. I do not believe the e-mail was \nsubmitted with the deliberate intent to mislead the adjudicator.20  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well educated \nman, highly regarded for his business acumen and technical proficiency. He has worked \nfor several defense contractors and received access to classified information at the \nsecret level for approximately 22 years. Except for the current allegations, most of which \noccurred from 1984 to 1990, there is no evidence Applicant has compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s questionable behavior happened during a four year period \napproximately 20 years ago. Considering his demeanor and testimony, I believe \nApplicant has learned from his mistakes, and the circumstances that led to his \nquestionable behavior are unlikely to recur. He is now a more mature and savvy person \nas a result of the legal, economic, and personal difficulties he and his family has \nendured, including the security clearance process. There is no evidence Applicant has \nbeen involved in additional misconduct or questionable behavior. To the contrary, \nApplicant\u2019s references recommend him for a security clearance without reservations. \nThey also lauded his reputation as an extremely hard-working and accomplished \nbusiness man, dedicated father, husband, and patriot. In sum, I find Applicant has \npresented sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  \n \n \n \n20  Arguably, Applicant\u2019s omission could be considered mitigated under AG I7(b) if it was caused by \nthe improper advice of Applicant\u2019s legal counsel. See the previous discussion concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2c and \n2d. \n \n\n \n18 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence convinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from the allegation of his criminal conduct and personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a & 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 30, 2007, and elected to have her case\ndetermined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's\nwritten case (FORM) on or about February 28, 2007. Applicant filed a response to the FORM on or\nabout March 26, 2007. The case was assigned to me on May 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 46 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was indebted to the IRS in the amount of $14,212.21 for tax year 1985.

In February 1996, the IRS filed a tax lien against her. In March 2007, the lien was released.\nIt is not clear from the evidence if the two aforementioned tax liens were released because\nthe IRS gave up trying to collect the debts or because the debts were paid. In her response to the\nSOR, applicant admitted that she was indebted to the IRS in the foregoing amounts for the foregoing\nyears, but stated these were old debts that are \u201cpast [the] Statute of Limitations.\u201d In a different\nstatement (Exhibit 4) she again referenced the running of the Statue of Limitations, but then stated:\n\u201cThrough the years the IRS has taken our tax returns any time that we had money coming back and\neven emptied our bank account one time and yet the amount owed has never gone down.\u201d\nApplicant was due an income tax refund for tax year 2004. In April 2005, this refund, in the\namount of $3,303.00, was applied to applicant\u2019s remaining tax liability for tax year 1999.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant has a long history of not paying her Federal income\ntax when due. This conduct reflects adversely on her judgment and reliability, and suggests she\ncannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information. Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) (inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts) and 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) are\napplicable.\nOnce the Government established a prima facie case under Guideline F, the burden shifted\nto applicant to show she has reformed. Applicant failed to meet her burden. Although she offered\ncredible evidence that the tax liens filed against her have been released, she failed to provide (1) a\nsatisfactory explanation for why she repeatedly failed to pay her income taxes when due, (2) any\ncredible evidence that would support a finding that she is current on all of her Federal income tax\n\n3\nliabilities, and (3) any credible evidence that would support a finding that she is likely to satisfy future\nincome tax obligations when due. No Mitigating Conditions are applicable.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His debt problems\nresulted from his wife's medical emergencies and periods of unemployment. For the last two years\nhe has shown his financial responsibility by not generating any new delinquent debt. Applicant has\nmitigated security concerns arising under financial considerations. Clearance is granted. \n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 21, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On November 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\nSOR on January 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on May 28, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for June 12, 2007. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on June 12, 2007 to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Three\nGovernment exhibits (Ex. 1-4) were admitted into the record without objection.  Applicant's three\nexhibits (Ex. A-C) were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified in his own\nbehalf, as reflected in the hearing transcript (Tr.) received on June 21, 2007. At Applicant's request,\nI kept the record open until June 26, 2007 for Applicant to submit additional information. He timely\nsent bank statements and a debt management plan which are marked AE D and E for the record and\nadmitted without objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in subparagraphs 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, in\nthe SOR, \u00b6 1. are incorporated herein.

In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the\n1\nevidence and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old who works for a defense contractor. He is married, and has five\nchildren.  Applicant earned a high school diploma in 1997 and attends college courses.  He\n2\n3\nsubmitted an application for a security clearance on December 21, 2005.\nAfter graduation from high school, Applicant started employment with a defense contractor.\nHe stayed with the company until August 2002 when he was laid off.

However, the military advised him he had too many\nchildren.  He completed an application for a security clearance on December 21, 2005.\n4\nWhen Applicant married in October 2000, his financial problems had already started. He was\nevicted from an apartment in July 2000 due to a neighbor's complaint. As a result of the unpaid rent,\na judgment in the amount of $925 was entered against him.  Shortly thereafter, his car was\n5\nrepossessed, but he did not understand the consequences. He believed the dealer would hold the car\n\nTr. 64.\n6\nTr. 70.\n7\nTr. 44.\n8\nTr. 40.\n9\nApplicant's receipt in file, dated 2002.\n10\nAE D (Bank Statements).\n11\nAE B (Letter dated June 11, 2007).\n12\nAE D (Debt Management Plan dated June 2007).\n13\nTr.106.\n14\nAE C (Applicant's credit report, dated June 11, 2007).\n15\n6\nfor him until he could pay.  His wife had a child in January 2000 from a prior relationship and\n6\nanother child was born in 2001. In order to save money, Applicant moved them into his\ngrandmother's house.  He attempted to assume the mortgage after his grandmother died, but\n7\nunfortunately that property was foreclosed in August 2001.  His wife had another child the next year\nand her relatives lived with them. Applicant attempted to support his wife's relatives.\nIn October 2002, Applicant and his wife broke the lease on their apartment and a debt of\n$3000 was the result. At the same time, his wife had medical problems due to several miscarriages.\nApplicant took some time from work to attend to his wife. Due to more unemployment, Applicant's\ndebt continued to plague him.  In March 2003, he was again evicted from another property due to\n8\nhis unemployment. He worked at low paying jobs, but in 2004, he and his wife were again evicted\nfrom a home, and a judgment in the amount of $2,901 was the result.  At that time he and his wife\nhad five children.  They were living pay check to pay check. He incurred bills for utilities, credit card\n9\ndebt and other living expenses that he could not pay.\nApplicant attempted to supplement his limited income with overtime and jobs on the road\nduring these years. Through a wage garnishment, he paid a judgment in 2002.  He paid some debts\n10\nin 2006-2007 due to extra income from being overseas six months. Three of those months he spent\nin Iraq. With his extra income, he paid most of the debts in the SOR.  He sought financial\n11\ncounseling from his brother who has expertise in the banking industry. He was advised to contact\ncreditors and collection agencies, and disputed the debt in 1.h. However, he was also advised to\nimprove his credit score by paying debts rather than consolidating them.  Applicant's remaining\n12\ndebts from the SOR are allegations 1. k, 1. l, and 1. m. These debts total approximately $10,000.13\nApplicant earns approximately $4,000 net a month.  Today, Applicant lives more within his\n14\nmeans and has not acquired any significant debt other than his home mortgage and car loan. His\ncredit bureau reports confirm his paid accounts.  He is current on his mortgage and his car loan. His\n15\ncredit rating is improving. He is financially more stable.

He accepts responsibility for paying those debts. He accepted another overseas\nassignment that will generate sufficient income to allow him to make monthly payments. He signed\nan agreement in June 2007 with a debt management company to allow direct payments on the\nremaining accounts in the SOR. Applicant is receiving debt management counseling in accordance\nwith this agreement. He has a structured payment plan.17\nApplicant is highly recommended by his employer. He is rated as a highly motivated,\ndependable, dedicated individual  who strives to make improvements for himself as well as his peers.\nHis three years of employment are unblemished. He has excellent potential and opportunity for\nadvancement in the defense industry.  \n18\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the conduct, (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a\ncase can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n19\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n20\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n21\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n22\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n22\ndecision.23\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n24\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n25\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\n\n Id.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n26\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n27\n AG \u00b6 18.\n28\n9\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n26\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n27\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised AG most pertinent to the evaluation\nof the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.28\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued fourteen\ndelinquent debts since 2000. He still owes approximately $10,000 in debt.  Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and FC DC, \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Applicant suffered with\nunemployment on a number of occasions. His wife had some difficulty with her pregnancies and\ntherefore she had some medical problems. Applicant was the sole support for his wife and five\nchildren. His unemployment caused him to get behind in his bills some time ago. He attempted to\nsave by moving into his grandmother's house. Therefore, FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. \nApplicant received financial counseling and paid a judgment through  a wage garnishment.\nHe  contacted his creditors and paid what he could. He paid many of his debts in January 2007 when\nhe had extra money from his work overseas. He is now situated to pay the remaining three debts. FC\nMC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)  and FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(d) (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply.\nThe issue before me is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his\noutstanding debts, but whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or\n\n10\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security clearance decision. His remaining unpaid debt\ndoes not constitute a security risk.  He has a professional position with a good income and stands\nready to proceed with his repayment plan.\nWhole Person \nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis an earnest, young man who is supporting a wife and five children. He assumed many\nresponsibilities at any early age. He worked diligently in his field in the defense contractor industry\nbut suffered periods of unemployment. He persevered to support his family through the times of\nmedical emergencies and periods of unemployment. He attempted to join the military to stabilize his\nsituation. His testimony at the hearing was candid and straightforward. At the hearing he\nacknowledged the financial delinquencies would be considered a negative. He is open, honest and has\nnot hidden the situation. His financial circumstances have improved. The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress is low. He is current on his financial obligations, and has a very\npositive employment history since 2004. Changes resulting from counseling and greater awareness\nof financial responsibilities will result in a continuously improving trend of financial circumstances.\nIn sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is low. Applicant's financial case shows his\nwillingness to utilize his repayment plan to resolve his delinquent debts. However, three SOR debts\nremain unpaid and not resolved. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all\nthe facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

On February 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to\n1\ngrant a security clearance, and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the\nSOR was issued.\nOn March 12, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 13, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 20, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for May 10, 2007. Applicant\u2019s attorney filed a Notice of Appearance on April\n24, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government submitted 11\nexhibits, Exs. 1-11 and Applicant submitted 2 exhibits, Exs. A and B. All of the exhibits were\nadmitted into the record without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 22, 2007.\nMOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS\nAt the hearing, the Government moved to amend subparagraph 1.b of the SOR to conform\nto the evidence as follows:\n1.b  On or about November 4, 1986 you were arrested for possession and sale of\nnarcotics by the Arizona police. You were found guilty and sentenced (4) years in\nprison. You were incarcerated for this conviction from approximately September\n1988 to approximately April 27, 1989.3\nAt the hearing, Applicant did not object to the amendment of subparagraph 1.b.  Accordingly,\nthe SOR is amended as stated above.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations under Guideline J, subparagraphs 1.a through\n1.c. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\n\nId.\n4\nId. at 67.\n5\nEx. 3 (Stipulation of Fact).\n6\nId.\n7\nTr. 68.\n8\nApplicant\u2019s Answer (dated, March 12, 2007).\n9\nTr. 67.\n10\nEx. 4 (General Court-Martial Order No. 45, dated May 11, 1987); Ex.

From\nOctober 15, 1979 to November 1, 1987, Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force. He was a staff\nsergeant (E-5).  He was married in 1984 and divorced in 1989.\n4\n5\nApplicant has two arrests stemming from using cocaine and distributing cocaine and\nmarijuana. Between May 1, 1986 and October 3, 1986, Applicant used cocaine on approximately 10\nto 15 different occasions.  Between September 1, 1986 and October 3, 1986, he distributed cocaine\n6\napproximately 10 times. On October 21, 1986 and October 25, 1986, he purchased and distributed\nmarijuana.7\nOn November 4, 1986, Applicant was arrested for possession and sale of narcotics. The arrest\nwas a coordinated effort by the U.S. Air Force and the state and two separate sentences were\nimposed. The November 1986 arrest was on Applicant\u2019s 27th birthday.  He was in a failed marriage.\n8\nHe was also addicted to cocaine.9\nOn March 19, 1987, at a general court-martial, Applicant pled guilty to three specifications\nin violation of Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice: specification 1, wrongful use of\ncocaine; specification 2, wrongful distribution of cocaine; and specification 3, wrongful distribution\nof marijuana. His sentence included the reduction of his rank to the lowest enlisted grade (airman\nbasic), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, confinement for 33 months, and a bad conduct discharge\nfrom the military.  After serving more than 18 months in prison for his military conviction, he was\n10\ngranted parole on September 21, 1988. His military parole was terminated on or about September18,\n1989.11\nPursuant to his arrest by the state, he was found guilty and sentenced to four years in prison.\nHe served this sentence after release from his military confinement. He was incarcerated for this\nconviction from approximately September 1988 to approximately April 27, 1989.

Dec. 19, 2002).\n21\n5\nWhile incarcerated in a military prison, Applicant successfully completed an intensive drug\nrehabilitation program for three months, which included daily individual counseling, attendance at\nNarcotics Anonymous meetings three times a week, and group counseling.  He has been drug free\n13\nsince November 4, 1986.14\nApplicant\u2019s employment since May 1989 with a defense contractor was part of his parole\npackage with the state parole board. He started out at an entry-level position in the shipping\ndepartment and has progressively been given more responsibility through the years.  He currently\n15\nis a program manager.\nFive character witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant.  They favorably and highly\n16\nendorsed Applicant\u2019s security clearance application. They have worked with him during his course\nof employment. They testified that Applicant is an exemplary, trustworthy, and highly regarded in\nhis professional environment.\nIn the 20 years since his arrest, Applicant\u2019s criminal record is clean, except for an improper\ndriving ticket in February 1997 and a speeding ticket in November 2006.17\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n18\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n19\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n20\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n21\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\n\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n22\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n23\n6\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n22\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n23\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nSmith Amendment\nA provision of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year\n2001, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 (The Smith Amendment), which was subsequently amended, mandates\nrestrictions on the granting or renewal of security clearances. This statutory limitation was\nimplemented within the Department of Defense by a June 7, 2001, Memorandum, and within DOHA\nby Operating Instruction (OI) 64, issued initially on July 10, 2001, and revised on September 12,\n2006. Under the provision, a person convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, who was\nsentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that\nsentence for not less than one year, is disqualified from being granted a security clearance. In\nmeritorious cases, an exception to the disqualification may be granted if there are mitigating factors.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nCriminal conduct under Guideline J is always a security concern because criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The Government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.\nApplicant was arrested and convicted for possession and distribution of narcotics in a coordinated\neffort by the state police and the U.S. Air Force. His sentences were separate. In 1987, at a general\ncourt-martial, he was convicted of using cocaine and distributing cocaine and marijuana. He served\nmore than 18 months in a federal prison for this conviction. Moreover, he received a bad conduct\ndischarge from the Air Force because of his drug-related behavior. He served approximately seven\nmonths in prison based on the state conviction. Consequently, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally prosecuted or\n\n7\nconvicted), and \u00b6 31(f) (conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime,\nsentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated as a result of that\nsentence for not less than a year) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate the criminal conduct security concern. Here, the crime was\ncommitted more than 20 years ago. The record is devoid of Applicant committing any other crime\nsince his arrest in 1986 for drug use and distribution, and that crime was an isolated incident.\nMoreover, since his release from both incarcerations and completion of paroles, Applicant has not\nbeen involved in any known criminal activity. He has been on the same job since 1989 and has been\npromoted several times. He has successfully integrated back into society and is successfully\nrehabilitated. Thus, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment),\n(the crime was an isolated incited incident) and \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement) apply.\nAfter weighting the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all facts and circumstances , in\nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant presented evidence to mitigate the security\nconcerns pertaining to criminal conduct. However, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, Applicant\ncannot be granted a security clearance because he served more than 18 months in prison based on\nhis court-martial. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied based solely on\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.\n\n8\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

He failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under\npersonal conduct guidelines. He also intentionally falsified his security clearance application.\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nA Notice of Hearing dated October 5, 2007 was mailed to Applicant. He waived the 15-day period for notice.\n2\nDepartment Counsel noted at the hearing that allegation 1.a had an error in the date of the application. The\n3\ncorrect date is September 27, 2004. In addition, allegation 1.o should read January 1991 not 1990. The allegations were\namended at the hearing with no objection from the Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated August 27, 2007.\n4\nGE 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated September 27, 2004).\n5\nId.\n6\nTr. 31.\n7\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 27, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On July 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR,\n1\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn August 27, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 2, 2007. A\nnotice of hearing, dated October 5, 2007, scheduled the case.  I scheduled the hearing for October\n2\n26, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on October 26, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment Exhibits (GE 1-10) were admitted without objection. Applicant did not provide any\nexhibits for the record. Applicant testified in his own behalf. The hearing transcript was received on\nNovember 5, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted to all allegations in the SOR  under Guideline E with the exception of\n3\n1.e and 1.o.  The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the\n4\nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

On that application, he listed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy discharged in 1985. He also responded \u201cyes\u201d to Question 18 concerning\narrests for May 1981, February 1989, and January 1991. These three incidents were DUI\u2019s.8\nIn a sworn statement on March 31, 1992, Applicant explained in great detail that a writ of\ngarnishment was filed against him for a debt of $236 which he paid. He also explained in detail the\nalcohol driving incidents of 1981, 1989, and 1991.9\nApplicant was again arrested on December 15, 1995 for public drunkenness, resisting arrest\ntrespassing, and simple assault. He was convicted of public drunkenness and resisting arrest, and\nfined $295. In 1996, Applicant was arrested for public drunkenness and assault again. The court\nfound him guilty on the public drunkenness charge. He was fined $100.10\nApplicant married his second wife in 1998. This marriage proved very difficult for him. His\nwife drank heavily and there were incidents of domestic violence. They also had financial\ndifficulties. In fact, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in March 1998 which was discharged\nin June 1998.11\nOn June 19, 1999, Applicant was arrested for Assault/Domestic Violence. He pled guilty and\nwas sentenced to one year in jail, all but five days suspended and two years probation. \nIn 2001, Applicant had several arrests and more financial difficulties. On July 15, 2001,\nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence, and possession of a controlled substance\ncocaine which is a felony. The police confiscated cocaine found in his vehicle.

He does not use drugs. However, he was embarrassed because\nthe drugs in the car were his daughter\u2019s. He was charged with the possession of the drugs in his car.\nThis was an automatic felony.

He admitted that\nin his answer to allegation 1.c and 1.d,  and at the hearing stated he falsified that answer because he\nwas embarrassed. He said that he honestly did not know why he made the false statements.15\nWhen Applicant completed a security clearance application in September 2004, he answered\n\u201cno\u201d to Questions 24 (Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses); 26 (Your Police Record-Other\nOffenses); 33 (Financial Records/Bankruptcy); 35 (Financial Record-Repossessions); and 36 (Your\nFinancial Record-Tax Lien). Applicant acknowledged falsification of the answers to Questions 24,\n26, 33 and 35. He did not falsify an answer to Question 36. \nApplicant was adamant that he did not falsify his response to Question 36 concerning a tax\nlien. He was quite clear at the hearing that the property in question was turned over to his first wife\nafter the divorce though the court agreement. The property was sold. He had no interest in the\nproperty and answered the question based on that belief.16\nOn May 11, 2006, a Special Agent interviewed Applicant. When questioned about the July\n15, 2001 charge for drug possession, Applicant told the Agent that the substance was given to him\nby a friend. Later in an answer to an interrogatory, he noted that the substance belonged to his\ndaughter. He admitted that he was inconsistent with his statement. He did not want to involve his\ndaughter in any way. \nApplicant enjoys his current position. He has never had any problem during his 34 years with\nhis employer while he held his security clearance. He admits his mistakes. He does not use drugs.\nHe answered his 1991 security clearance application and disclosed his alcohol-related incidents and\nhis financial problems. The incidents from 1989 until 1991 were disclosed on his first application.\nAlso, Applicant is divorced from his second wife. It was during that marriage that most of his\ndomestic violence incidents and alcohol-related incidents had occurred.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n17\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nset forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n18\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n19\n Id.\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n21\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n22\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 2002).\n23\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n24\n5\nguideline. Additionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the\nadjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n18\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n19\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n20\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.21\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n22\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n23\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  \n24\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline E of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n\n6\nOn September 27, 2004, Applicant, in response, to Question 24: Your Police Record -\nAlcohol/Drug Offenses did not disclose his charge of July 15, 2001 of DUI and Possession of a\nControlled Substance. Despite the fact that the guilty plea was set aside after his successful completion\nof a Drug Court Diversion program on July 11, 2003, this charge was intentionally omitted from\nApplicant\u2019s answer.\nOn the same application, Applicant failed to disclose a June 19, 1999 arrest and charge for\nAssault and Domestic Violence in response to Question 26: Your Police Record-Other Offenses. He\npled guilty to the charges and received a suspended sentence and two years probation. He admitted\nintentionally omitting this information.\nAt the hearing, Applicant specifically admitted to intentionally falsifying Questions 33 and 35\nconcerning his financial record (again on the September 2004 application). He had no reasonable\nexplanation other than he was embarrassed about the situations. When questioned, he stated he\nhonestly had no other reason for not providing the correct information.\nUnder Disqualifying Condition (DC) Personal Conduct (DC PC)\u00b6 16(a), the government\nestablished that Applicant omitted a material fact from his answers to Questions 24, 26, 33 and 35.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions that he deliberately falsified his answers to these questions raise DC PC \u00b6 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from an personnel\nsecurity questionnaire).  I find that this was a deliberate falsification for the reasons discussed above.\nFor these reasons, allegations 1.a through 1.d are found against Applicant.\nApplicant presented credible evidence at the hearing that he did not intentionally falsify his\nanswer to Question 36 concerning a tax lien against his property. When a falsification allegation is\ncontroverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does\nnot establish or prove an Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An\nadministrative judge must consider the record as a whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence regarding an Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time  the omission\noccurred. I find that Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 36 was not a concealment or deliberate\nfalsification. Thus, allegation 1.e is found in favor of Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent statements to the Special Agent in 2006 considering his answers to\nthe interrogatory concerning the July 15, 2001 drug charge raises DC PC \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator,\nsecurity official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative). Thus,\nallegation 1.f is found against Applicant.\nApplicant admitted to the allegations relating to domestic violence or assault and public\ndrunkenness (allegations 1.h through 1.m). These incidents are from 1995 through 1998. However,\nthese allegations are not properly under PC DC\u00b6 16(c) and (d) as suggested by Department Counsel.\nThey are covered under other guidelines which are not alleged in this case. Under other guidelines they\nmay have been mitigated due to time and rehabilitation. Moreover, they have been included as the\nbasis for the falsifications alleged under 1.a, and 1.b.\n\n7\nAllegations 1.n through 1.q were listed on Applicant\u2019s 1991 security clearance application.\nThey are from 1989 through 1992. Thus, they are not found against Applicant in this case under\npersonal conduct for falsification. Moreover, the conduct alleged in these SOR paragraphs would be\nmitigated under PC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nApplicant was sincere in his demeanor and testimony at the hearing. He acknowledges that he\nmade mistakes and has corrected them. He is divorced from his second wife and is no longer involved\nin domestic violence issues. His last alcohol-related incident was in 1999. He has worked steadily for\nhis employer for 34 years without any incidents. He has had a security clearance for 20 years.\nHowever, Applicant has not carried his burden in this case. Even Applicants with a good work record\nmay be denied a security clearance because his work performance is not the only issue in a security\nclearance case. His off-duty conduct is the critical component in this case, and his multiple arrests and\nconvictions show a lack of reliability and trustworthiness.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. I have considered his embarrassment over the 2001 incident and his desire\nto conceal that information given his successful drug diversion program in 2003.  However, over a 12-\nyear period, Applicant has committed a variety of offenses. He has no arrests since 2001, but the 2004\nintentional falsification is not mitigated. His failure to be candid with the investigator in 2006 is recent,\nserious and not mitigated. It is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.
