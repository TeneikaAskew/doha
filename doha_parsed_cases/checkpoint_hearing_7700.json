Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nHerbert M. Silverberg, Esq.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines G and J, as well as her favorable finding as to paragraph 2(b)\n1\nunder Guideline E, are not at issue in this appeal.  \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 23, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nNovember 25, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has a history of\nconsuming alcohol to excess.  In 1990, while on active duty with the Air Force, Applicant received\na letter of admonishment for setting off a fire extinguisher as a joke.  In October 1996 he was\narrested on an Air Force base for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI).  He completed an alcohol\nawareness program and attended a victim impact panel, following which the charges were dismissed.\nIn April 2002, Applicant was arrested for DWI, resulting in a plea of guilty.  He completed an\nalcohol screening, attended both a DWI school and a victim impact panel, and paid court costs.  In\nMay 2002, Applicant submitted a SF 86, Security Clearance Application (SCA).  In response to a\nquestion about alcohol-related charges or convictions, Applicant listed the 1996 DWI but did not\nmention the 2002 offense.  In the Analysis section of her decision, the Judge stated of the omission,\n\u201c[Applicant] decided . . . that since the arrest had just occurred, he would wait to see the legal\noutcome.  Although he stated, he did not intend to conceal his arrest, that is exactly what he did.  The\nquestion is clear.  He deliberately omitted information that would have impacted his clearance.\u201d\nDecision at 9.   Subsequently, in August 2005, Applicant was again arrested for DWI.  He was\nsentenced to 30 days house arrest, fined, and required to perform community service.  In addition,\nhe was required to install an ignition interlock system on his car, to attend Alcoholics Anonymous,\nand to undergo a year of supervised probation.  He successfully completed the probation. \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that his omission of the 2002 DWI was\nof security significance.  He states that \u201cno action was taken against his clearance . . . when the\ntransgression was fresh . . . He was allowed to keep his clearance . . . despite this concern.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 1.  However, prior decisions to grant or retain a clearance do not undermine the\nlegal sufficiency of a Judge\u2019s subsequent adverse decision.  \u201cThe government is not estopped from\nmaking an adverse clearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 03-04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).  See also ISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul.\n12, 2007).  The Judge\u2019s decision, viewed in light of the record as a whole, draws a rational\nconnection between the facts found and its ultimate denial of a security clearance for Applicant.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the\n\n3\nUnited States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck\nLines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable\non this record.  Decision at 12.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Silverberg, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 16, 2006.\nHe submitted an earlier security clearance application on May 4, 2002. On April 23,\n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines G, E, and J for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 19, 2008 and answered it on\nthe same day. He requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge through Counsel.\nI received the case assignment on August 22, 2008. I denied Applicant\u2019s request for an\ninitial postponement for an unavailable witness but continued the case for a second day\nof hearing to accommodate the witness by video-teleconference. DOHA issued a notice\nNovember 25, 2008\n\n2\nof hearing on September 3, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nSeptember 24, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented the\ntestimony of five witnesses at the first hearing. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A through C,\nwithout objection. The hearing was continued on October 21, 2008 for the testimony of\nthe final witness. DOHA received the transcript of the first hearing (Tr.) on October 2,\n2008 and the second transcript (Tr. 2) on October 28, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 19, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.g; \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b; and \u00b6 3.a of the SOR, with explanations. He\nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is 48-years-old. He is divorced with no children. After college in 1984,\nhe joined the United States Air Force (USAF) where he became a helicopter pilot. He\nserved on active duty until 1996 and on active reserve duty from 1996 until March 2005\n(GE 1). He has been an instructor pilot for a government contractor for approximately 12\nyears (Tr. 124). He has held a security clearance since 1984.\nApplicant started drinking alcohol in college with his friends in a social setting. He\ndid not drink every weekend but he consumed alcohol (mixed drinks), at times to excess\nand to the point of intoxication from 1980 to at least November 2005. Applicant drank\nfour to eight mixed drinks on average when he was out with friends (Tr. 129).\nIn 1990, while in the USAF on active duty, he was charged with Drunk and\nDisorderly Conduct. He had been drinking that evening (8-10 drinks) and set off the\nalarm for a fire extinguisher in the barracks as a joke (Tr. 127). Applicant elaborated at\nthe hearing that the Navy base was a \u201clittle more uptight, nothing exciting happens, so\nwhen the alarm went off, five fire trucks show up, five police cars show, everything there\n- the whole rescue is there\u201d (Tr. 126). Applicant received a letter of admonishment from\nhis USAF Commander (GE 7).\nApplicant\u2019s drinking habits from 1990 until 1996 included drinking on Friday\nnights and sometimes on a Wednesday evening with his military friends at a club. He\nwould consume approximately eight or ten drinks (Tr. 128). On October 14, 1996,\nApplicant was arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). He completed an alcohol\ndriver awareness program ordered by the state, and attended a victim impact panel (GE\n4). The DWI charge was later dismissed.\nIn 1999, Applicant was diagnosed with diabetes and he stopped drinking until\nearly 2002 (Tr. 133). He had stopped drinking for medical reasons one other time. He\nacknowledged that he started drinking again gradually and seldom to intoxication. He\n\n3\nexplained that he increased his drinking in 2002 due to his divorce and a stressful\nsituation at work due to a strike (Tr. 135). Applicant also explained at the hearing that he\nenjoys the taste of alcohol and if he were cutting the grass, he might enjoy a few cold\nbeers (Tr. 134). He also described his enjoyment of wine with pizza. \nOn April 10, 2002, Applicant was arrested for DWI -First offense and Failure to\nMaintain a Traffic Lane. His breath-alcohol level was .14%. He acknowledged that he\nhad been drinking that evening after receiving a phone call from his wife that she\nwanted a divorce (Tr. 135). He was also stressed due to a strike at work. He believes he\nhad about eight drinks. He pleaded guilty to charge one and attended an alcohol\nscreening. He paid court fees of $328. He completed DWI school and attended another\nVictim Impact Panel (GE 6).\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in May 2002 (GE 2). In\nresponse to Question 24 regarding any alcohol offenses, Applicant listed his 1996 DWI.\nHe did not list the 2002 DWI charge from one month prior because he did not want to\n\u201cmuddy up the paperwork\u201d (Tr. 137). He wanted to wait a few months to see the actual\ncourt outcome. He testified at the hearing that he did report his DWI to his command\nabout one month later (Tr. 138). His statement is inconsistent with the written\ninformation provided to an investigator in November 2002.  At that time, Applicant stated\nhe had not informed USAF and did not believe he was required to do so (GE 4).\nIn 2005, Applicant drank every day after work and on the weekend. He admitted\ndrinking to intoxication several times a week with his friends after work. He usually\nconsumed eight mixed drinks. He last drank to intoxication in late 2005. He noted on his\nanswer to the SOR, that November 2006 is not the correct date for consumption of\nalcohol. He claims he did not drink during his probation.\nOn August 2, 2005, Applicant was charged with Aggravated Driving While\nIntoxicated - Second offense, and Driving Within Traffic Lane. He pleaded guilty to an\nmended count (DWI - First Offense and was sentenced to 30 days house arrest\n(reduced to 15 days for good behavior). He paid fines and fees of approximately $719\nand completed 48 hours of community service. His driver\u2019s license was revoked from\nOctober 2005 until October 2006. He was required to install an ignition interlock system\non his vehicle before he could drive. He was required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) three times per week for a period of time and one group counseling meeting per\nweek. A licensed clinical social worker confirmed that Applicant enrolled and attended\n52 counseling sessions in the substance abuse program (AE B). He was placed on\nsupervised probation for one year. Applicant was successfully completed probation in\nMarch 7, 2007 (AE C).\nApplicant continued to drink after probation ended on March 7, 2007. He drank\ntwo drinks of bourbon at home (Tr. 157). He acknowledged that he had a problem and\nhe needed to \u201ccontrol\u201d it. At this point in time, he started praying about the problem and\nspeaking to his pastor. Applicant immersed himself in church activities (Tr.142). His\ncurrent drinking is perhaps one or two bourbons twice a month (Tr. 158). He reports this\n\n4\nis done at home. Although one witness described Applicant may have a drink at his\nhouse but waits hours before he drives himself home.\n \nApplicant\u2019s colleagues attest to his honesty and integrity (Tr. 27). He is reliable\nand has performed his duties with exceptional dedication. He has favorable\nrecommendations from his colleagues and his supervisor. Applicant has volunteered in\nthe community to perform charitable activities for at least ten years (Tr. 43). Applicant\u2019s\nlongtime friends testified that he has changed his drinking habits. He has a glass of\nwine at dinner sometimes (Tr. 46). He is described as responsible about his drinking\nand driving. There are occasions that Applicant does not drink at all when he is out with\nhis friends (Tr. 25). \nIn March 2007, Applicant was interviewed as part of his security clearance\nprocess. During that interview, he told the investigator that he did not intend to drink in\nthe future. He acknowledged that drinking had a negative impact on his life and he\nfeared losing his job due to his alcohol arrests and his past use of alcohol (GE 3).\nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that information concerning \u201cfearing the loss\nof his job\u201d may have been taken out of context.  He understands the importance of the\npast history of alcohol use and the seriousness of it as well. He also stated that he has\npaid for his mistakes legally and financially. \nApplicant was evaluated for substance abuse as part of his security investigation.\nHe admitted to a history of significant alcohol use. He attended AA meetings in late\n2005, 2006, and 2007. He attended the same meeting on Wednesday evenings for\nabout one year and a half. He was an active participant in AA (Tr. 63). A fellow AA\nmember testified that Applicant was sincere and participated in meetings. He attended\nthe same Wednesday night meeting as Applicant (Tr. 62). He heard Applicant talk about\ngoing to church and his commitment to the church. He also felt that Applicant\u2019s minister\nacted as a \u201csponsor\u201d to Applicant (Tr. 68). At some point after probation, Applicant\ndecided to stop attending AA meetings, continue involvement with his local church and\nreceive counseling from his minister (Tr. 90).  \nApplicant\u2019s former pastor has known him since 2003 (Tr. 91). He regards\nApplicant as a highly committed individual who is reliable, especially with his church\nvolunteer activities (Tr. 96). Applicant met with his pastor in the recent past to discuss\nquestions of life choices. Applicant talked about AA and drinking in a responsible\nmanner with his pastor. Applicant believed at this time that he did not have a craving for\nalcohol, did not have a problem with alcohol, and that he did not need the AA meetings\n(Tr. 98). He told his pastor that he drinks on social occasions. His pastor recommends\nApplicant for a security clearance and has no reservations about his trustworthiness (Tr.\n101).\nApplicant\u2019s current pastor counsels him on a regular basis. Applicant shared his\npast history of alcohol use with him (Tr. 112). Applicant is an active member of the\ncongregation and was recently baptized. He volunteers in a variety of community\n\n5\nactivities. The pastor believed Applicant is a social drinker but he acknowledged that he\ndoes not know how much Applicant does drink at this time (Tr. 113; 119). He\nrecommends Applicant for a position of trust and responsibility. \nApplicant describes his present day drinking as perhaps once or twice a month.\nHe drinks one bourbon or maybe two at the most. He drinks at home and sometimes at\na friend\u2019s house (Tr. 158). He waits for a few hours before he drives home. He relies on\nhis spirituality to guide him to make good choices concerning alcohol. He also has a list\nof phone numbers from AA members who he can call for support (Tr. 160). He believes\nhe has truly changed his outlook on life. In the past six months, Applicant states he\ndrinks even less due to the strength derived from the church and support from AA\nmembers he can call (Tr. 158).\nIn May 2008, Applicant met with a psychiatrist who interviewed him for\napproximately three hours and completed a clinical evaluation. He reviewed some\nrecords that were furnished to him by Applicant\u2019s counsel. The psychiatrist diagnosed\nApplicant with mild depression with a history of alcohol abuse in partial full remission (Tr\n2. 17). He testified that Applicant now engages in asymptomatic drinking (Tr.2 18). He\ndescribed this as controlled drinking which does not cause any occupational or social\nproblems. Applicant reported drinking a couple times a month, three or four drinks (Tr.\n2. 40). The evaluator reported Applicant\u2019s prognosis was good because he had\nattended AA and was involved in a spiritual counseling and volunteer work (Tr.2 19). He\nexplained that Applicant is strongly committed to his church, religion and volunteering,\nand that would outweigh a commitment to alcohol. The psychiatrist acknowledged that it\nwould be better if Applicant did not drink at all due to his medical condition (diabetes).\nHe did not think Applicant would be a security concern at this time (Tr.2 23). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n6\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nIn this case, Applicant has a documented history of problems with alcohol from\n1990 until 2005. He has three-alcohol related driving incidents and four arrests (one for\n\n7\ndrunk and disorderly). His last DUI was in 2005. He admitted he has a history of\nsignificant alcohol use which has led to impaired judgment while driving. Applicant\nadmitted that he was a habitual drinker. Thus, AG \u00b6 22 (a) and (c) apply.\nIn May 2008, Applicant was given a diagnosis of mild depression with a history of\nalcohol abuse in partial full remission by a psychiatrist. The legal and substance abuse\ntreatment history was deemed significant. Thus, AG \u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly\nqualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d applies.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant has a lengthy history of alcohol abuse, and his last DUI was in 2005.\nHe had an ignition interlock on his vehicle until October 2007. He successfully\ncompleted his probation. Since 2005, he has not had any other alcohol-related\nincidents. He has received counseling and treatment on several occasions since 1990.\nApplicant did not see a need to abstain from alcohol after his treatments. He received\nalcohol treatment and counseling in the past and did abstain from drinking for almost\ntwo years due to medical problems in 2002. Applicant has acknowledged that he\nabused alcohol in the past but now he is committed to a more spiritual life. Although he\nno longer attends AA, he has a phone list of AA members available for support. He\nspeaks to his pastor about issues. Applicant maintains that his drinking is responsible at\nthis point in his life. A psychiatrist stated that Applicant is an asymptomatic drinker. He\n\n8\nhas received a favorable diagnosis from a psychiatrist in 2008 on the condition that he\nmaintain his support system. Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption concerns\nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), (b) and (d).\n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\nApplicant did not disclose his alcohol related arrest in 2002 on his security\nclearance application. He did not forget about it but rather decided that he would just\nwait until the court outcome. He admitted that this was probably the wrong thing to do.\nThus, AG \u00b616(a) and 16(b) apply. \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following conditions could mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\n\n9\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nI do not find that he has mitigated the personal conduct concern in this case. He\ndeliberately omitted the information on his security clearance application. Applicant\nstated that he was completely candid with the investigators during his interviews and\nlater investigation. Applicant did not come forward after the 2002 court outcome.  He\nwas asked why he did not list the April 2002 incident on his May 2002 security\nquestionnaire by an investigator in November 2002. He did not misunderstand the\nquestion. He decided on his own accord that since the arrest had just occurred, he\nwould wait to see the legal outcome. Although he stated, he did not intend to conceal\nhis arrest, that is exactly what he did. The questions is clear. He deliberately omitted\ninformation that would have impacted his clearance. The fact that he was more candid\nduring the November interview does not mitigate the falsification.  In his answer to the\nSOR, Applicant admitted the allegations under criminal conduct and agreed that his\ndelay in relaying the information about the April 2002 alcohol arrest was \u201ctechnically a\ncrime\u201d but he also realized that the matter would have to be reported in due course\nwhen it became official. This gives me doubts about the trustworthiness of Applicant. He\neven acknowledged that it was probably the \u201cwrong thing\u201d to do but he did it anyway.\nApplicant was not completely candid at his hearing about the reason he failed to\ndisclose his DWI arrest. I do not believe his explanation was credible at the hearing. \nIn his November 2002 statement to investigators, Applicant stated he had not\ninformed his command about his 2002 DUI and did not believe he was required to do\nso. At the hearing, he testified that he had done so. His explanation was confusing\nbecause he stated that he may have mixed up the dates and then stated that he was\nnot sure because he was in civilian status and not on duty. He admitted the allegation in\nhis answer to the SOR. Based on the inconsistency, I conclude that Applicant did not\nnotify his command. Applicant has not mitigated the concerns under the personal\nconduct guideline.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By it\u2019s\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant admitted that he did not list his 2002 DUI arrest on his security\nclearance application. He intentionally omitted this information. He was not credible\nconcerning his reporting to his command. He admitted that the delay on his part was\n\n10\n\u201ctechnically a crime\u201d and realized that the matter would have to be reported in due\ncourse when it became official.\u201d His deliberate falsification with respect to Question 24\nconstituted a violation of 10 U.S.C. Section 1001. The government has established its\ncase for falsification. This is a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code,\nSection 1001, a felony.  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nApplicant has provided mitigation under this guideline. The event occurred in\n2002, about six years ago.  The federal statute of limitations is 5 years. There have not\nbeen any other instances. Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply in this case. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant served in the USAF and\nheld a secret clearance. He has no incidents or issues with protecting information.\nApplicant has a history of problems with alcohol. He has been arrested for DUI three\ntimes with the last incident occurring in 2005. He was also arrested for drunk and\ndisorderly in 1990.  Since that time he completed court ordered treatment programs and\nmodified his drinking. He was diagnosed recently in 2008 by a licensed psychiatrist as\nan asymptomatic drinker with a history of alcohol abuse in partial full remission. He has\n\n11\ninvolved himself in his church and committed himself to a different life. Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal offenses are alcohol-related and omission of relevant information concerning a\nDUI. He has not had any legal problems since 2005. \nApplicant did not disclose his 2002 in his security clearance application one\nmonth later. He rationalized that he would wait until the legal outcome before he would\ndisclose the information. This was an intentional falsification. He also did not report\ninformation to his command, but there is no proof that he is required to do so. He told an\ninvestigator that he did not believe he was required to do so. At the hearing, Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation was not credible. I have confirming doubts about Applicant\u2019s credibility.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from\npersonal conduct. He has mitigated the concern under alcohol consumption and\ncriminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on October 21, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on December 16, 2008.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of 18 exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nand three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December 24, 2008.  Based\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n2\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested for 11 separate\noffenses between October 1995 and May 2007.  Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged\nto have accumulated 17 delinquent debts exceeding $25,000.00.  And under Guideline\nE, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (e-QIP) of April\n2007 by understating his alcohol/drug-related arrests.\n                                                                                                                                \n      For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his criminal charges and\naccumulated debts, but denied falsifying his security clearance application.  He claimed\nto have avoided recurring episodes of anger, domestic violence and alcoholism with the\naid of pastoral and professional assistance.  He claimed his covered offenses in the\nSOR were attributable to mistakes due to a lack of maturity and responsibility.  He\nclaimed to have taken positive steps with a debt consolidation company to eliminate his\nlisted debts.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old cable technician for a defense contractor who seeks to\nretain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is a high-school graduate.  He has been married three times, and  he\ndivorced each of his spouses.  He has two children with his current fianc\u00e9, and they\nreside with him and receive his financial support (R.T., at 35).  \nApplicant enlisted in the Marine Corps in August 1993.  He did not adjust well to\nmilitary life and was discharged for other than honorable reasons in August 1993 (see\nex. 1; R.T., at 36).  He was introduced to alcohol at the age of 16.  For most of his adult\nlife, beer has been his drink of choice.  Although, he did sometimes turn to hard liquor\nduring his years of spousal turmoil with his last wife. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest history\nBetween October 1995 and May 2007 Applicant was arrested on 11 separate\noccasions for assorted alcohol and drug-related offenses, domestic violence incidents,\nsoliciting for prostitution, and traffic-related offenses.  He admits each of these listed\noffenses and attributes most of his arrests over the past two years to alcohol abuse,\nanger problems, and a rough childhood  (R.T., at 41-43, 59).  Four of his covered\narrests were alcohol-related (see exs.  13 through 17). \n\n3\nDomestic issues with his last wife adversely affected his job performance with his\nlast employer.  Arguments with his wife caused him to miss a lot of work with this\nemployer and directly contributed to his termination from another employer in June 2006\n(see ex. 3).\nApplicant\u2019s most recent arrest occurred in May 2007 and was for possession of\nmarijuana, driving on a suspended license for a prior DuI conviction, no headlamps, and\nno seatbelt (see exs. 3, 14 and 15; R.T., at 38-40).  He was found guilty of marijuana\npossession and driving on a suspended license in July 2007, and was sentenced to 45\ndays in jail (suspended) on the following conditions: pay a fine of $1,935.00, complete a\nmultiple offender state counseling program, abstain from drinking while his license\nsuspension remained in effect, and abstain from drinking for three years and attend 20\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings per month (see ex. 15; R.T., at 39-40).  \nApplicant has since completed most of his court-ordered conditions and still\nattends AA meetings every two weeks (R.T., at 40). His court-ordered program did not\ninclude  random testing for drugs and alcohol. The only time he has ever been tested for\ndrugs is at work, and in that test, he tested negative for any illegal substances (R.T., at\n53-54).  His court-imposed abstinence has more than a year to run.\nBefore his May 2007 arrest, Applicant was arrested in December 2006 and\ncharged with being an unlicensed driver (no alcohol or drugs cited).  Prior to being cited\nfor this traffic-related offense, he was arrested  in October 2006 for DuI.  Preceding his\nOctober 2006 DuI arrest, Applicant consumed five beers and was pulled over by police\nwhile driving home from a nightclub gathering.  When administered a Breathalyzer,\nApplicant reported a .14 per cent blood-alcoholic content (BAC) (see exs. 3 and 14).   \nApplicant has made progress in controlling his emotions and avoiding alcohol\nthrough spiritual healing and personal acceptance of responsibility (R.T., at 44-46).  He\nwas introduced to alcohol at the age of 16 (beer).  For most of his adult life, beer has\nremained his drink of choice.  Although, he did turn to hard liquor during his years of\ndomestic quarreling and turmoil (R.T., at 43).  \nSince December 2006,  Applicant has carefully avoided alcohol and illegal drugs\nof any kind (see ex. C; R.T., at 49-50).  He has regularly attended AA meetings and\nintends to continue to attend these meetings (R.T., at 40, 46).  He works with AA\u2019s 12-\nstep program and has completed the step that asks for help (R.T., at 47-49).  He is\nhelped in the maintenance of his sobriety by his own confessions and those of his fellow\nAA members (R.T., at 47).  He has an AA sponsor, who is his pastor (R.T., at 49).\nApplicant has no AA chips to commemorate his sobriety at present, but assures he is\neligible to receive his one-year chip, and has no intention to return to alcohol (R.T., at\n45, 49-50).  Without corroborative support for his assurances, they cannot be afforded\nthe full weight that Applicant seeks.  In the meantime, he remains under court order to\nabstain from alcohol, and provides no progress reports or updates from his counselors\nor probation officers.\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nApplicant accumulated 17 delinquent debts (exceeding $25,000.00) between\n2000 and 2008 (see exs. 4 through 7 and 18).  Creditor 1.m represents the largest listed\ndebt.  Opened in 2001, the account was charged off for non-payment in 2003 (see ex.\n7).  Applicant assures he has contacted a debt consolidation service and bankruptcy\nconsultant in 2008 to address his debts (R.T., at 79-80, 84-85). Applicant provides no\ndocumentation, though, of any communications or start-up fee payments with a debt\nconsolidation service or bankruptcy consultant.  Without some documentation, his\nclaims cannot be fully assessed or validated (see ex. C).  He provides no\ndocumentation either as to how he intends to resolve his debts.  \nWhile Applicant continues to consider petitioning for Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nrelief, to date he has taken no action.  He is concerned it could hurt his credit, and will\ninitiate bankruptcy only as a last resort (see ex. 2; R.T., at 82-85).  He has not taken any\ntangible steps either to obtain financial counseling or address his creditors individually.\n(R.T., at 83-84).  His listed debts remain outstanding without any tangible attention\ndevoted to resolving them.  He has no savings or net monthly remainder to allot to his\nindividual creditors and no visible means of paying his listed creditors (R.T., at 86-87).\nApplicant is committed first to taking care of his family with his available resources\n(R.T., at 87).\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in April 2007, Applicant omitted his alcohol-related\narrests of October 2006 and February 1999 when responding to question 23d.  He\nattributes his omission of his 1999 arrest to memory lapse (see ex. C; R.T., at 110-11 ).\nBecause the charges arising out of his 2006 DuI arrest had not yet resulted in any\nconviction, he asked his facility security officer (FSO) at the time for advice on how to\naddress this arrest in his e-QIP (R.T., at 105-07).  She passed away before she could\nget back to Applicant with an answer (R.T., at 107).  Without professional advice to\nguide him, Applicant interpreted the question on his own and omitted his October 2006\narrest for the lack of a conviction at the time he executed his e-QIP in April 2007 (R.T.,\nat 107-08).\nIn a follow-up interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) in August 2007, the investigator reviewed Applicant\u2019s arrests with\nhim.  Before she could ask him any questions about his October 2006 DuI arrest, he\ntold her of the arrest and the pending charges against him (R.T., at 101, 109-11).  The\ninvestigator proceeded to ask him about his 1999 DuI arrest, which he indicated he had\nforgotten about when completing his e-QIP (see ex. 3;  R.T., at 95-96, 110-11). \nApplicant has consistently insisted that he could not recall being arrested for DuI\nin February 1999 (R.T., at 75-76).  His 1999 DuI arrest is fairly dated (see ex. 17) and\nconceivably could have been forgotten when he completed his e-QIP in April 2007 due\nto the number of arrests involved.  His omission of his October 2006 DuI is more difficult\n\n5\nto reconcile with the clear instructions in question 23d about providing details about\narrests and charges, not just convictions (see ex. 1).  But Applicant assures he sought\nadvice from his FSO about the 2006 arrest, and volunteered details of the arrest in his\nfollow-up OPM interview before the agent could confront him with it. The summary of\ninterview does not contradict Applicant in any way on his claims, and his affirmative\nresponse to question 23d and overall credibility sufficiently shows he was not trying to\nhide his arrests to avoid embarrassment and the potential loss of his clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations enable him to avert inferences of knowing and wilful\nfalsification. \nApplicant is supported in his clearance application by his FSO and his mother\n(see exs. A and B).  Both find him worthy of obtaining a clearance.  \n \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 30.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  AG \u00b6 18.\n\n6\n Personal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \n\u201cConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15.\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: \u201cImproper or illegal involvement with drugs raises\nquestions regarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect\nclassified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or\noccupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure\nof classified information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 24\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern. \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 21.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or continue an\napplicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is\nclearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated\nin the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As\nwith all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n\n7\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an employed defense contractor with a considerable history of arrests\nand convictions, most involving domestic violence issues and drug/alcohol-related\noffenses.  Security concerns are also raised over a number of debt delinquencies (17 in\nall) that exceed $25,000.00 and omissions of two of his alcohol-related offenses in the e-\nQIP he completed in April 2007. Raised drug and alcohol concerns are associated with\nhis arrest history.\nCriminal conduct offenses\nApplicant\u2019s history of multiple arrests and convictions involving domestic violence\ncharges and drug/alcohol-related offenses warrant consideration of two disqualifying\nconditions of AG \u00b6 30.  DC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d\nand DC \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged,\u201d have application.  Applicant\u2019s arrests and convictions\ncomprise 11 separate incidents over a 10-year period between October 1995 and May\n2007. Among his arrest/convictions are four alcohol-related offenses, three domestic\nviolence offenses, one soliciting/prostitution offense, and one drug possession offense.\nWith the aid of the lessons he acquired in his most recent anger management\ncounseling, he has developed better control mechanisms for dealing with potential\ndomestic violence and alcohol issues.  Divorced with two children to support (while living\nwith his fianc\u00e9), Applicant faces new parental challenges and has accepted parental\nresponsibilities.  However, he has been able to develop any seasoned track record yet\nfor making safe predictions about the future. \nBecause of the severity and recurrent nature of Applicant\u2019s arrest history over the\npast 10 years, it is too early to afford him any reliance on  MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  His own testimonials about his maturation\nprocess and the support he has drawn from his FSO, AA meetings, and his mother are\nhelpful, but not enough at this time to enable him to take advantage of any of the\nmitigating conditions covered by AG \u00b6 32.  Based on a consideration of the applicable\nguidelines, Applicant\u2019s efforts to date are insufficient to enable him to mitigate the\ncriminal conduct specifically associated with his multiple arrests and convictions.  \nTo his credit, Applicant has shown considerable responsibility and care for the\nwelfare of his fiance and her children he supports.  His compliance with his probation\nconditions and continued AA participation reflects positively on his commitment to accept\nmore responsibility and honor the laws and rules of civil society. \n\n8\nWhole person assessment of Applicant\u2019s arrest history and mitigating efforts\ninclude an evaluation of the following considerations: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the adequacy and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.  Applicant\u2019s covered actions must be balanced against all of the material\ncircumstances surrounding the criminal conduct at issue and steps he has taken to\nprevent recurrence.\n Taking  into account all of the facts and circumstances developed in the record,\nApplicant\u2019s covered arrests and convictions still leave residual security concerns after\ncrediting him with the corrective steps he has taken in his work and personal life.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k of the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s financial issues\nSecurity concerns are also raised under the financial considerations guideline of\nthe AGs where the individual applicant is so financially overextended as to indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which\ncan raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts (17 in all) and his past\ninability to pay these debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the AGs: DC \u00b6 19(a), inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b619(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has no documented efforts to resolve his\ndelinquent debts that exceed $25,000.00.  His claims of contacting a debt consolidation\nfirm and bankruptcy consultant are not documented and cannot be corroborated in this\nrecord.  \nNeither extenuation nor mitigation credit are available to Applicant.  His failure to\nprovide any documented proofs of extenuating circumstances associated with his debts\nor good faith repayment efforts and/or counseling initiatives preclude him from relying on\nany of the available mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\nimproper influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\n\n9\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations and his lack of any documented steps taken to resolve them, the\nsupport he has received from his FSO, AA meetings and his mother, and his own\npersonal account of the changes in his lifestyle to ensure more personal responsibility in\nhis personal affairs, Applicant provides too little probative evidence of progress with his\ndebts to mitigate security concerns related to his proven debt delinquencies.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 2.a through 2.q of the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol history\nApplicant\u2019s four alcohol-related arrests covered in the SOR raise major concerns\nover his risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  On the strength of the evidence presented, two\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the AGs for alcohol consumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be\napplied: DC \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while\nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d and DC \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol\nto the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as\nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he acknowledges his excessive alcohol consumption and\nthe adverse effects that his abuse of alcohol played in his family and in his use of public\nroads and highways over a 10-year stretch spanning 1995 and 2006.  His abstinence\nassurances are entitled to some weight, but are open to some uncertainties about the\nquality of his sobriety and AA participation without corroboration from his sponsor and/or\nfellow AA members and chips commemorating his sustained abstinence.  Further, he\nhas never sought an evaluation from a credentialed physician or licensed substance\nabuse counselor and provides no corroborative support of the lessons he claims from his\nanger management and counseling courses. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide any corroborative support of his AA and abstinence\ncommitments are important considerations in determining what weight to assign to\nApplicant\u2019s rehabilitation claims.  See ISCR Case 02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006);\nISCR Case 01-20579, at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004).  With over a year to run on\nApplicant\u2019 s court-imposed three-year abstinence requirement,  uncertainties abound\nover Applicant\u2019s ability to maintain his sobriety.\nStill troubling and of ongoing security concern is Applicant\u2019s history of recurrent\nalcohol-related arrests, the absence of any professional diagnoses and prognoses, and\nhis lack of a more extended period of sustained abstinence.  While Applicant provides\nassurances of his sincere commitment this time to maintain his current track of sobriety\nwith the help of AA, his sustained abstinence efforts are still relatively new (about two\nyears). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s probation conditions include three years of sustained\nabstinence.  This sustained abstinence condition will not expire for another year and a\n\n10\nhalf. This is not to suggest his renewed commitments to sobriety do not reflect positive\nchanges in behavior supportive of sobriety.  \nFaced with similar recurrent alcohol-related arrests over a considerable period of\ntime, our Appeal Board has expressed reluctance to make safe predictive judgments\nabout an applicant\u2019s ability to avoid abusive incidents in the future without strong\nprobative evidence of sustained recovery, aided by positive professional reinforcements.\nSee ISCR Case No. 06-17541 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 (App.\nBd. Nov. 9, 2007).  Applicant\u2019s circumstances do not enable him to differentiate these\nguides forged by the Appeal Board in addressing alcohol-related arrests.\nTaking into account both Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, his strong work\nrecord, the applicable guidelines and a whole person assessment of his most recent\nsobriety efforts, conclusions warrant that his overall efforts, while encouraging, do not\nreflect sufficient  evidence of sustained commitment to AA and its tenets of sobriety to\nconvince he is no longer at risk to recurrence.  In the past, he has enjoyed considerable\nperiods of sobriety only to return to episodic drinking that involved alcohol-related\nincidents away from work.  Because of this recurrent abuse problem, his earlier incidents\ncannot be considered isolated and unrelated to a pattern of abuse, despite their\ncomparative age when considered separately.\nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make a convincing showing\nthat he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent\nproblems with judgment lapses related to alcohol.  Without a more sustained record of\nsobriety to rely on, Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are simply not enough at this time to\nwarrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated\nwith such conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by the alcohol guideline of the SOR. \nImplications of Applicant\u2019s drug-related arrest\nApplicant\u2019s documented involvement with illegal substances are minimal.  His only\nproven association with drugs is the marijuana possession imputed him by his May 2007\ndrug possession arrest/conviction. This arrest alone is not enough to establish any\npattern of drug abuse.\nStill, Applicant's recent documented drug possession is sufficient to invoke two  of\nthe disqualifying conditions of AG \u00b6 24, i.e., DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201c any drug abuse,\u201d and DC \u00b6\n25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  Neither of these conditions\nrequire any minimal pattern of abuse.\nApplicant has not used or possessed marijuana or any other illegal substance\nsince his first and only drug-related arrest in May 2007. To be sure, misconduct\npredictions (to include return to illegal drug use), generally, may not be based on\nsupposition or suspicion.  See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. October 2002); ISCR\n\n11\nCase No. 97-0356 (App. Bd.April1998).  The Appeal Board has consistently held that an\nunfavorable credibility determination concerning an applicant is not a substitute for\nrecord evidence that the applicant used illegal drugs since his last recorded use, or\nbased on his past use he is likely to resume drug usage in the future.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-08032 (Appeal Bd. May 2004). \nBased on the absence of any developed record of recurrent drug abuse by\nApplicant, there are no prudent reasons to infer that he has used marijuana or any other\ndrug on other occasions, (prior or subsequent to his May 2007 arrest/conviction).\nAccordingly, Applicant may claim the mitigation benefits of one of the mitigating\nconditions of the Guidelines for drugs: MC \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s limited involvement with illegal drugs and his assurances that his\nmarijuana possession is a thing of the past are convincing.  Considering all of the\ndeveloped evidence of record, Applicant mitigates security concerns associated with his\nisolated possession of marijuana.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-\nparagraph 4.a that is covered by Guideline H.\nFalsification issues\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s multiple omissions of his alcohol-related arrests in the security clearance\napplication he completed in April 2007, and in his withholding of his arrest/charges\narising out of his October 2006 and February 1999 incidents.  So much trust is imposed\non persons cleared to see classified information that deviation tolerances for candor\nlapses are gauged very narrowly. \nApplicant\u2019s October 2006 alcohol-related arrest was followed by filed charges of\nDuI.  On these charges, Applicant was scheduled to appear in court to respond just days\nafter he completed his April 2007 e-QIP.  Concerned about how to answer the pertinent\nquestion covering his alcohol-related arrests, he went to his FSO at the time for\nguidance.  Before she could get back to him with helpful instructions, she suddenly\npassed away.  Pressed to complete and return his completed e-QIP, Applicant omitted\nhis 2006 DuI arrest, along with his February 1999 DuI arrest (this one for reasons of\nmemory lapse).\nBy omitting his October 2006 and February 1999 DuI arrests, Applicant initially\nraises the question of whether he failed to satisfy minimum standards of candor covered\nby AG \u00b6 15.  DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\n\n12\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d has some initial application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\n \nBy itself, Applicant\u2019s confusion explanation for his 2006 arrest omission is difficult\nto accept.  His prompt, good faith correction of the omission in his ensuing OPM\ninterview helps to fortify his explanation for his initial omission, and mitigate any candor\nconcerns about his answers. \nIn the past, the Appeal Board has denied applicants availability of the predecessor\nmitigating condition of MC \u00b6 17(a) \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts,\u201d where the applicant has waited many months to timely correct a known omission.\nCompare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (App. Bd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-\n1390 (App. Bd. January 1995).  \nApplicant\u2019s correction of his 2006 e-QIP omission was made both promptly and\nvoluntarily in Applicant\u2019s case, and enable him to convincingly mitigate security concerns\nover this omission.   Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his e-QIP omission of\nhis October 2006 arrest/charge, and his proven prompt, good faith correction, Applicant\u2019s\nclaims satisfy the necessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions that he\nknowingly and deliberately withheld material background information about ths prior\narrest/charge.\nApplicant\u2019s memory lapse claims covering his earlier 1999 DuI arrest are plausible\nenough to enable him to avert inferences  of knowing and wilful omission of this charge,\nand convincingly demonstrate that the falsification allegation covering his 2006 arrest is\nnot proven.  This allegation is concluded to be unsubstantiated. \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.(a) factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to subparagraph 3.a of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2 (a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.k:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n13\nSub-paras. 2.a through 2.q:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):          \nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE H: (DRUGS):          \nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 4.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE G: (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):           AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 5.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on June 20, 2006.\nOn June 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign influence\n(Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is dated July 16, 2008. Based on a careful\nevaluation of all the evidence in the record, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for security clearance\naccess is granted. At the hearing, the government submitted three exhibits (GE 1-3).\nTestimony was taken from Applicant. I took administrative notice of several publications\nJanuary 12, 2009\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nfrom United States Government agencies that describe the governments of Lebanon\nand the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and their human rights record internally. The\npublications also address the governments\u2019 practices regarding the collection of\nprotected information from other countries and their association with internal and\nexternal terrorist activities. DOHA received the transcript on November 6, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all five factual allegations listed under the foreign influence\nguideline of the SOR. Applicant is 35 years old and married with three children. He has\nworked as a senior program engineer for his employer (a defense contractor) since April\n2006. He seeks a secret security clearance. This is the first time Applicant has applied\nfor a security clearance. \nApplicant was born in Lebanon in August 1973. In 1987, Applicant\u2019s father, a\nmath teacher in Lebanon, took a teaching job at an international high school\nheadquartered in the UAE (Tr. 16, 18). After approximately three months in the same\nyear, Applicant\u2019s father moved the entire family (Applicant, his mother, and two sisters)\nto the UAE and away from the religious and cultural discord present in Lebanon. Over\nthe next three years, Applicant completed high school at the international school in the\nUAE. In 1990, he decided to enroll in additional high school education. With no\nadditional high school education available in the UAE international school campus,\nApplicant transferred to the English campus of his school. (Tr. 18).\nAfter receiving his high school degree in late 1991, Applicant came to the U.S. to\npursue additional education. He enrolled in a technical university in December 1992. In\nDecember 1995, he received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Electrical Engineering. In\nDecember 1997, he was awarded a Master\u2019s Degree in Electrical Engineering. While he\nwas attending the technical institute, he participated in the cooperative work/study\nprogram at the research branch of the school. \nAfter completing his education in December 1997, Applicant was employed as\nmanager of a signal processing technologies company from January 1998 to February\n2004. Next, he was employed as a software engineer for two years before being hired\nas senior program engineer by his current employer in April 2006. \nIn July 1998, Applicant married his girlfriend, who was born in the U.S. in\nDecember 1972. She has never lived or worked in a foreign country (Tr. 40). Applicant\nbecame a U.S. citizen in June 2005, and obtained his U.S. passport in September 2005\n(GE 1, 2). He has no intention of renewing his expired foreign passport. \nApplicant\u2019s mother was born in Lebanon (SOR 1.a) in February 1948. She\nmoved to the UAE in 1987 with the rest of the immediate family to live. She continued\nher teaching career in the new location, and at the same school as Applicant\u2019s father.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nAlso, Applicant\u2019s mother and father have lived on the UAE school campus since 1987.\nBoth Applicant\u2019s mother and father obtained their permanent U.S. resident status in\nabout July 2008, and will move to the U.S; they have no intention of returning to\nLebanon (Tr. 23, 45). They remain in the UAE for employment reasons (Tr. 26), and will\nqualify for a pension through the UAE pension system, not Lebanon (Tr. 42). \nApplicant\u2019s mother has no close friends in Lebanon. She contacts her one sister\nand five brothers (Lebanese resident citizens) a few times a year, and visits them on\noccasion (Tr. 42-44, 52-53). Applicant\u2019s mother provides her siblings no monetary\nsupport. Her parents are deceased. Applicant\u2019s mother has no political contacts in\nLebanon or the UAE. \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Lebanon (SOR 1.b) in January 1942. As noted\nearlier, he continued his teaching career in the UAE to get his family away from the civil\nstrife in Lebanon. Applicant hopes his parents will retire to the U.S. in two to three years\nso they can enjoy their grandchildren (Tr. 31). Applicant is uncertain whether his father\nwas required to serve in the Lebanese military, but he is sure his father never worked\nfor the Lebanese government (Tr. 47). \nApplicant is very close to his parents. They contact each other by phone about\nonce a week, and exchange e-mails on occasion (Tr. 48-50). His parents may have\ncontact with Applicant\u2019s sisters on a daily basis. Applicant provides no support to his\nparents. Applicant\u2019s parents have never had any contact with any extremist\norganizations like Hizballah (Tr. 48). \nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister was born in Lebanon (SOR 1.c) in October 1977. She\nmoved with the rest of the family in 1987 to UAE. She is now a permanent resident\ncitizen (H1-B visa), and lives in the western part of the U.S. (GE 2). She has an\nindustrial engineering degree, and is married (Tr. 17) Applicant talks to her by telephone\na several times a week, and may visit her a few times a year. \nApplicant\u2019s youngest sister was born in Lebanon (SOR 1.c) in August 1984, and\nspent three years in the country before moving permanently to the UAE with the family.\nAt the present time, she lives about 20 minutes from Applicant and attends a technical\nschool on a student visa (Tr. 16). She completed her industrial engineering degree, and\nis now studying for a business administration degree (Tr. 17). Applicant wants his\nyoungest sister to obtain her permanent visa, but is aware she may not meet the\nresidency requirements. She applied for resident alien status through the lottery, but\nwas not successful (Tr. 49). Applicant\u2019s mother recently applied for permanent\nresidence in his younger sister\u2019s behalf (Tr. 50).\nApplicant\u2019s grandmother, about 85 years old, lost her husband (Appellant\u2019s\ngrandfather) three years ago (Tr. 28). She is a resident citizen of Lebanon (SOR 1.d)\nwith no political affiliation. She receives no pension from the Lebanese government (Tr.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\n51). Applicant\u2019s father regularly supports her (Tr. 28). Applicant communicates with his\ngrandmother and aunt between one and three times a year (Tr. 51). Like Applicant\u2019s\ngrandmother, none of his aunts and uncles have ever worked for the Lebanese\ngovernment (Tr. 52-53). \nApplicant\u2019s aunt and two uncles (on his father\u2019s side) are resident citizens of\nLebanon (SOR 1.e). One uncle works for a pharmaceutical company, the other uncle is\nemployed by a water bottling company, and the aunt is unemployed (Tr. 52-53).\nApplicant\u2019s mother has one sister and five brothers. The sister is a part-time\nschool teacher, one brother is a contractor, one is a dentist, one is retired from\nemployment with a regional airlines, one does some kind of work for a municipality, and\nthe fifth brother may already be retired (Tr. 53-56).  \nApplicant has never exercised a privilege of foreign citizenship, including voting\nin a foreign election, engaging in foreign political activity, paying foreign taxes, and\nworking for a foreign government (Tr. 38). See also, GE 1. Applicant does not believe\nhis association with foreign family members and a possession of a foreign passport\ncould be used to blackmail or influence him (GE 2). Applicant has no intentions of\nrenewing his Lebanese passport (Tr. 39).\nRegarding Applicant\u2019s financial interests, his only financial interests are in the\nU.S. (GE1; Tr. 59). He has no property in Lebanon or the UAE (Tr. 56). Applicant\nrecalled his grandfather on his father\u2019s side may have owned some real estate, but\nApplicant was not certain who inherited the property (Tr. 55). Applicant owns his home\nand considers it to worth about $400,000.00. He has investments, e.g., stocks and\nmutual funds, to be valued at about $170,000.00; he has a one-third interest in a\ncondominium to be worth about $166,00.00 (Tr. 56-58).\nAdministrative Notice\nLebanon, a parliamentary democracy, and the U.S. have had long standing,\nfriendly ties. The country is 95% Arab, with a population of mostly Muslim sects,\nChristian groups, Druze, and other political groups. One of the groups that have a fairly\nlarge presence in the country is Hizballah, a terrorist organization. Hizballah gets its\npower and influence from Lebanon\u2019s Shi\u2019a sect, and has offices throughout the country\nand elected deputies in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. \nSyria withdrew its military forces from Lebanon in April 2006. However, Syria still\nhas an intelligence network in the country that provides support and weapons to\nHizballah and other terrorist organizations in southern Lebanon for use in attacks on\nIsrael, keeping the region in a constant state of instability.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of individually ruled emirates.\nThe government is a federal republic with a president and a council of ministers. The\nU.S. and UAE have enjoyed compatible relations since 1971. The relationship drew\ncloser during the Iraqi incursion into Kuwait in 1991. The UAE is a reliable partner in the\nregional and global war on terror.\nThe low number of human rights problems in the UAE is attributed to the lack of\nelections and certain restrictions on civil liberties. However, while there are no\ndemocratically elected political parties, UAE citizens are allowed to air their concerns to\nUAE leaders in council-type meetings. Although the law prevents freedom of assembly,\nmodest demonstrations on working conditions have been permitted. Arbitrary arrests\nare prohibited, but reports have disclosed that the government has held people without\nformally charging them. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law that recognize the complexities of\nhuman behavior, and are to be applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national interest. In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nForeign Influence\n6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with the risk of terrorism.\u201d \u00b6\n6.\nThe mere possession of family ties in a foreign country is not automatically\ndisqualifying under the FI guideline. ISCR Case No. 98-0507 (App. Bd. Dec. and Rem.\nOrd., May 17, 1999) at 10. However, the citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s\nmother, father, two sisters, grandmother, aunt and two uncles, potentially creates \u201ca\nheightened risk of foreign influence\u201d as set forth in Foreign Influence (FI) disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion). \nTo determine whether Applicant faces a heightened risk of foreign influence due\nto the citizenship/residence of his foreign family members depends a number of factors\nother than the citizenship and residence of family members, including the political\ncharacter of the foreign country in question, its relationship to the U.S., and the\nprospects an applicant\u2019s family members may be subject to pressure or coercion. See\nISCR Case No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). If the foreign family member is\nassociated/employed or dependent on the government, or the government is\nauthoritarian, then the chances for foreign influence directed to and through the foreign\nfamily member are more likely. Even friendly nations like Lebanon and the UAE do not\nalways have the same interests as the U.S. Neither Lebanon nor the UAE are collectors\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nof foreign intelligence. On the other hand, the terrorist organization Hizballah continues\nto use Lebanon as a base of operations for engaging in terrorist activities to destabilize\nthe middle eastern region. But there is no indication Hizballah uses terrorism to collect\nintelligence from foreign sources. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 60 years old, and has been a teacher for about 2/3 of her\nlife. She is a citizen of Lebanon where she began her teaching career over 40 years\nago. In 1987, she moved with the rest of the family to the UAE, allowing her to continue\nteaching at the same campus location as Applicant\u2019s father. There is no evidence her\nteaching position is administered by the Lebanese or UAE governments, or that she is\nan agent of either government. Applicant\u2019s mother has her permanent U.S. residence\ncard and plans to move to this country with Applicant\u2019s father in two or three years. \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Lebanon in January 1942. In 1987, he took the\nteaching job in the UAE because the move provided a valuable opportunity for the entire\nfamily to escape Lebanon. Neither Applicant\u2019s father nor his mother has any intentions\nof returning to Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s father, like Applicant\u2019s mother, has spent his entire\nlife teaching. There is no evidence he has ever been employed by the Lebanese or UAE\ngovernments or is an agent of either government.  \nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister was born in Lebanon in October 1977. She moved to\nUAE ten years later with the rest of the family. She received her industrial engineering\ndegree in the U.S. She is now a married, permanent U.S. resident citizen living in the\nwestern part of the U.S. She intends to obtain American citizenship. \nApplicant\u2019s youngest sister was born in Lebanon in August 1984. She joined the\nrest of family in the UAE in 1987. She is currently in the U.S on a student visa attending\na local technical university, and lives a short distance away from Applicant. While she\nrecently was not selected for resident alien status, Applicant\u2019s mother sponsored for\npermanent residency in the U.S.  \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is a resident citizen of Lebanon with no political\naffiliation. Applicant\u2019s father provides regular support for her. She gets no pension from\nthe Lebanese government. She currently lives with Applicant\u2019s aunt. Though there is a\nrisk that pressure could be placed on and through Applicant\u2019s father due to his regular\nsupport of Applicant\u2019s mother, the strong ties Applicant has developed in this country\nwill successfully enable him to resist and report any pressures from foreign sources.\nFurther, Applicant\u2019s contact with his grandmother and his aunt is less that three times a\nyear, not a security concern under the foreign influence guideline. \nApplicant\u2019s aunt and uncle on his father\u2019s side of the family have never worked\nfor the Lebanese government. His aunt is unemployed. One uncle works for a\npharmaceutical company while the other is employed by a water bottling company. \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nApplicant\u2019s aunt on his mother\u2019s side of the family is a part-time school teacher.\nNeither Applicant\u2019s aunt nor her five brothers have ever worked for the government of\nLebanon. The contacts Applicant has with his aunts and uncles on both sides of his\nfamily are infrequent and not a security concern. \nSecurity concerns under the foreign influence guideline may be mitigated by FC\nMC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.). Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and two sisters are no longer living in\nLebanon. The sporadic number of contacts Applicant has with his grandmother, aunts,\nand uncles (on both sides of his family) removes these individuals as source of foreign\ninfluence under FC MC 8.a.\nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and long lasting relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest) also applies to show there is no conflict of interest between Applicant, his\nforeign family members and the U.S. Applicant has built a growing relationship in the\nU.S. that convinces me he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. Applicant\u2019s credible testimony demonstrated that he is a loyal U.S. citizen. He\nhas been in this country since 1992. He has been married since 1998, and currently has\nthree children born in the U.S. He has been employed as a senior program engineer by\nhis employer since April 2006. Applicant has successfully mitigated all disqualifying\nconditions under the foreign influence guideline.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FI guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of\nall the evidence surrounding the case. Applicant is a responsible and well-educated, 35-\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\nyear-old individual who has dramatically increased his bonds to this country since\narriving here in 1992. On his arrival, he began the course curriculum for an electrical\nengineering degree. In December 1995, he received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Electrical\nEngineering. In December 1997, he received a Master\u2019s degree in Electrical\nEngineering. \nIn 1998, Applicant married his wife, a U.S. citizen. The couple has three children\nwho were born in the U.S. Applicant received his U.S. citizenship in June 2005, and\nbegan working for his current employer in April 2006. Applicant owns a home worth\nabout $400,000.00. He has investments valued at about $170,000.00. His summer\nhome that he owns with two other couples is worth about $166,000.00. \nThough the risk of coercion or influence can never be completely ruled out, it is\nunlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of those remaining family members in Lebanon and interests of the U.S.\nRegarding the UAE, given their friendly ties to the U.S. since 1971, together with the\npartnerships the two countries have established to fight the regional and global war on\nterror, the chances of pressure and/or coercion being placed on Applicant\u2019s parents to\nreach Applicant are dramatically minimized. Accordingly, Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from foreign influence.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old (Tr. 31).4 He graduated from high school in 1998, and attended college, majoring in engineering and business (Tr. 32). However, he did not graduate (Tr. 32). Eventually, he intends to obtain a mechanical engineering degree (Tr. 33). On November 11, 2001, his father committed suicide, and Applicant increased his drug use (Tr. 33). After 2001 his depression gradually decreased; however, he remains on medication for depression (Tr. 33-34). He is currently \u201cemotionally stable\u201d (Tr. 43, A5). Although Applicant was fired twice (in May 2001 and July 2001), he did not disclose these terminations when he applied for his current employment because he did not think there was enough room on his employment application, and did not think it was relevant because he was fired from part-time jobs (Tr. 53-54). Moreover, the terminations back in 2001 were not that recent (Tr. 54). He does not currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 57). He does not have any prior military service.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 8 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 8, 2008). GE 8 is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nGuidelines G (alcohol consumption) and H (drug involvement). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on June 4, 2008, and elected to \nhave his case decided without a hearing (Government Exhibit (GE) 9). Department \nCounsel requested a hearing (Transcript (Tr.) 9). At the hearing held on August 28, \n2008, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits (GEs 1-5) (Tr. 14-16), and Applicant \noffered nine exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A1-A11) (Tr. 34-35). There were no \nobjections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A1-A11 (Tr. 16, 35-36). I received the \ntranscript on September 8, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR all of the SOR\u2019s allegations. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old (Tr. 31).4 He graduated from high school in 1998, and \nattended college, majoring in engineering and business (Tr. 32). However, he did not \ngraduate (Tr. 32). Eventually, he intends to obtain a mechanical engineering degree (Tr. \n33). On November 11, 2001, his father committed suicide, and Applicant increased his \ndrug use (Tr. 33).

Although Applicant was fired twice (in May 2001 and July 2001), he did not \ndisclose these terminations when he applied for his current employment because he did \nnot think there was enough room on his employment application, and did not think it \nwas relevant because he was fired from part-time jobs (Tr. 53-54). Moreover, the \nterminations back in 2001 were not that recent (Tr. 54). He does not currently hold a \nsecurity clearance (Tr. 57). He does not have any prior military service. \n \n \n \n \n \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GEs 2 and 3 (Responses to Interrogatories) and 9 (Response \nto SOR) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise.   \n  \n4GE 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated Jan. 9, 2007, will be \nreferred to as a security clearance application in this decision). GE 1 is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph, and the next paragraph unless otherwise stated. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication two to three times each \nmonth from about 1997 to about February 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a, Tr. 46). He was charged \nwith underage possession of alcohol in 1998, fined and ordered to complete community \nservice (SOR \u00b6 1.b). His parents suggested to Applicant in the late 1990s that he had \nan alcohol problem and should seek alcohol counseling (SOR \u00b6 1.c, Tr. 50). In May \n2001, he was terminated from employment for bringing a 12 pack of beer to work (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, Tr. 46, 55). He drank alcohol at work, but thought alcohol possession and \nconsumption at work was allowed (Tr. 55).  \n \nThe police arrested Applicant in May 2003 and authorities charged him with \ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) (Tr. 40). The breath alcohol tests conducted \nby the police were at .24 and .18 (Tr. 58, GE 3 at 6). Applicant claimed he drank two \nshots (one of tequila and one of Jaegemeister), two beers and two mixed drinks over \nabout a five hour period (Tr. 60, GE 3 at 6). The last four drinks were within about 90 \nminutes of leaving the bar (Tr. 61; GE 3 at 6). The court found him guilty and sentenced \nhim to jail for six months (suspended) attendance at Alcohol Safety Action Program \n(ASAP), three years of probation, and a one year restriction on his driver\u2019s license (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e). He completed ASAP (Tr. 41). However, he mistakenly said he did not have any \nalcohol counseling (Tr. 53, Compare GE 1 at \u00a7 25 with GE 1 at \u00a7 23). He has not had \nany alcohol-related offenses after his 2003 DUI (Tr. 41). His father had an alcohol \nproblem, and Applicant did not want to repeat his father\u2019s mistakes with alcohol (Tr. 51). \nHe did not get into any fights because of alcohol, and alcohol consumption did not \nadversely affect his finances (Tr. 52). Before his May 2003 DUI, he occasionally drove \nwhile under the influence of alcohol, but after his 2003 DUI he stopped drinking alcohol \nand then driving (Tr. 63).   \n \n \nApplicant drank three or four beers one to three times a week from the age of 19, \nuntil he obtained his current employment in November 2006 (Tr. 47). Applicant does not \ncurrently drink alcohol on a daily basis, but he does consume alcohol on weekends (Tr. \n39).  He usually drinks on Friday or Saturday, usually at a concert or gathering of friends \n(Tr. 40).  He drinks about four or five beers, but does not drive after drinking (Tr. 40).5 It \ntakes about four beers for Applicant to become intoxicated (Tr. 47).  He currently drinks \nto intoxication perhaps twice a month (Tr. 48).  \n \nApplicant occasionally drinks more than six or seven beers (Tr. 48). The most \nrecent time was a month before his hearing when he was vacationing with friends at the \nbeach (Tr. 49). During the week at the beach, he consumed alcohol on about four nights \n(Tr. 49).  On each night, he drank about six beers and one or two shots (Tr. 50). He did \nnot drive after drinking alcohol (Tr. 50). He continues to consume alcohol to intoxication \nbecause he \u201cI\u2019m adult enough to handle it in a responsible manner\u201d (Tr. 57). He \ndescribes his alcohol consumption as moderate (Tr. 39). \n \n5 Applicant told the OPM investigator on February 9, 2007, \u201csince his DUI [he] is very careful to \nnot drink more than 1 or 2 drinks when he is at a social club or social gathering. If he does drink more \nthan two alcohol drinks while out he gets a ride home from someone.\u201d (GE 3 at 6).  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana approximately 50 times from approximately August \n1997 to about August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a, Tr. 45, GE 1 at \u00a7 24). He purchased marijuana \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). His employer terminated his employment in July 2001 because his drug \ntest came back positive for the presence of the marijuana metabolite (SOR \u00b6 1.c, Tr. 45-\n46). He used cocaine at least five times from about June 2001 to about March 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d, Tr. 45, GE 1 at \u00a7 24). He used mushrooms three times from about January \n2004 to September 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, Tr. 45, GE 1 at \u00a7 24).  He has never sold illegal \ndrugs (Tr. 41). He has never been arrested or convicted of a drug offense (Tr. 61). He \npassed a drug test on August 11, 2003 (A4). The only source of information about his \ndrug use came from Applicant\u2019s disclosures (Tr. 62).  \n \n \nAn Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant on \nFebruary 9, 2007 (Tr. 24, 28; GE 3). The interview (GE 3) accurately reflects what \nApplicant told the OPM investigator (Tr. 26). His statement to the OPM investigator was \nconsistent with his statement at his hearing.  \n \nOn November 28, 2006, he started working at his current job (Tr. 34). He passed \nhis drug test when he started this job in 2006 (Tr. 34, 37, A3). He has remained drug \nfree after starting his employment in November 2006 (Tr. 37). He does not plan to use \ndrugs in the future (Tr. 41). His current employment is to design ductwork for heating \nand ventilations systems (Tr. 38). He loves his current employment (Tr. 39). He plans to \nmarry, have a good career, and purchase a house (Tr. 41, 44). He recognizes that \naccomplishing these goals is not compatible with drug abuse (Tr. 41, 44).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s primary physician for the last ten years indicates he has no history of \nalcohol or drug addiction, and is not addicted to illegal drugs today (Tr. 42-43, A5). He \nended his association with his drug-using friends and associates (Tr. 43-44). However, \nhe meets his drug-using associates four or five times per year \u201cin passing\u201d (Tr. 56). He \navoids the locations where drug abusers congregate (Tr. 44). The four persons who \nrented the beach house with Applicant a month before his hearing included marijuana \nuser(s) (Tr. 62). He offered to sign a statement of automatic revocation of his clearance \nfor any violation of drug laws (Tr. 44). \n \nRecommendations  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors, friends and co-workers at his current employment \nprovided six letters supporting reinstatement of his clearance (A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, \nA11). Those letters describe Applicant as a valuable member of the firm with a solid \nwork ethic and integrity. His contributions to his company have been numerous and \nvaluable. His work is good and accurate. He is a dedicated, trustworthy, bright, \nintelligent, talented, competent and honest employee. He volunteers in the community. \nApplicant is a professional, who is eager to show initiative and improve himself. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \nare divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are \nused to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the \nclearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.6 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 \nprovides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005).7 \n \n6 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7\u201fThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nSecurity clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and H (drug involvement) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) \nprovide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n \nDirective, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) to 22(g) do not apply. A qualified medical professional or licensed \nclinical social worker did not determine Applicant had an alcohol abuse or dependence \nproblem. He did not have a relapse after completion of an alcohol rehabilitation \nprogram. Binge drinking is not defined in the Directive and is not established. Although \nhe received an alcohol evaluation from a physician, and the diagnosis ruled out drug \ndependence, it did not rule out or address alcohol abuse. Although he received \ncounseling in an \u201calcohol rehabilitation program,\u201d he did not subsequently have a \nrelapse because the program did not result in advice to abstain from alcohol \nconsumption. No court orders concerning alcohol use or treatment were violated.  \nAG \u00b6 22(a) applies because Applicant was convicted of DUI in May 2003. AG \u00b6 \n22(b) applies because he was fired for bringing a 12-pack of beer to work.  AG \u00b6 22(c) \napplies because he habitually consumes alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.  \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) applies in part because Applicant only had two documented alcohol-\nrelated incidents that had an adverse effect on his life (the 2001 termination and the \n2003 DUI). These two events considered in isolation are somewhat infrequent or \nisolated, and not recent. He does not drink alcohol and drive, and accordingly, \u201cit \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n23(a), cannot be fully applied because he continues to consume alcohol to intoxication. \nAdditionally, he admitted committing other DUIs before the 2003 arrest that were not \ndetected by law enforcement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not acknowledge being \nalcohol dependent or having an alcohol abuse problem. Although he completed an \nalcohol abuse treatment program, he did not attend any Alcoholics Anonymous \ntreatment program. He continues to consume alcohol to intoxication and does not \nrecognize that drinking alcohol to intoxication, after his previous alcohol-related \nproblems raises security concerns.  Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that continued alcohol \nconsumption to intoxication showed a \u201cpattern . . . of responsible use\u201d because he did \nnot drive after consuming alcohol.  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of more substantial \nalcohol abuse than Applicant\u2019s that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless \nthere was a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR \nCase No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).  In a \ncase more factually similar to Applicant\u2019s case the Appeal Board listed the following \npertinent facts: \n \nIn August 2004, Applicant was charged with Driving While Intoxicated \n(DWI) after having consumed between 12 and 24 cans of beer at a social \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nfunction. His breathalyzer results were .223, the legal limit for alcohol \nbeing .08. He pled guilty and was sentenced to a fine and to perform \ncommunity service. He was required to attend a \u201csubstance abuse traffic \noffender program.\u201d Applicant\u2019s dates of attendance were January through \nFebruary 2005. Additionally, he was placed on probation for two years, \nwhich was set to expire in December 2006. Applicant has continued \ndrinking after completion of this program. He became intoxicated on \nMemorial Day 2006 and again the following July, when he consumed 12 to \n18 beers. Applicant stated at the hearing that he intends to continue \ndrinking but will avoid becoming intoxicated. \n \nISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) (reversing administrative \njudge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noting, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink even after his \nsecond alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d).   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to AB where AB had several \nalcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, six years \nbefore an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) \n(involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and \nreversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \nAfter carefully consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption, I conclude his continued alcohol consumption to intoxication after receipt \nof SOR \u00b6 1.a, which states, \u201cYou consumed alcohol, to the point of intoxication two to \nthree times each month. . . \u201d shows he is unwilling or unable to curtail his alcohol \nconsumption. As such, his conduct demonstrates a lack of judgment and/or a failure to \ncontrol impulses which is inconsistent with the holder of a security clearance.     \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug8 involvement-related conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n8AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \n \n(a) any drug abuse;9  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug \nuse,\u201d and \u201cillegal drug possession.\u201d  AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b) and 25(c) apply. The other \ndisqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. These disqualifying \nconditions apply because Applicant used marijuana, cocaine, and mushrooms. He \npossessed these drugs before he used them. He tested positive in 2001 on a drug test \nfor the marijuana metabolite, and was fired for drug use. \n \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances. See Sch. I (c)(9). See also Gonzales v. Raish, \n545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). Mushrooms are the street name for \npsilocybin or psilocin, which is a Schedule (Sch.) I Controlled Substance. See United States v. Hussein, \n351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a plant which may contain the Schedule I(c)(15) and \nI(c)(16) controlled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). Cocaine is a Schedule II Controlled Substance. See \nSch. II(a)(4) (cocaine).   \n \n9AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d10 \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant\u2019s last drug use was about two years ago in August 2006. AG \u00b6 26(a) \nfully applies despite Applicant\u2019s last illegal drug use being relatively recent. His overall \nillegal drug use lasted approximately nine years (1997 to 2006), and involved numerous \nuses of marijuana, brief use of mushrooms in 2004, and five cocaine uses.11 AG \u00b6 26(a) \napplies because his past drug use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Because of his abstention from drug use for about \ntwo years, and his recognition of the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse, there is \nreasonable certitude that he will continue to abstain from drug use. I am reasonably \nconfident his illegal drug possession and use will not recur. Because he will not use \nillegal drugs in the future and is subject to drug testing at his employment, confidence in \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment with respect to drug use is \nrestored.   \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has somewhat disassociated from his drug-using \nassociates and contacts. He does not routinely return to locations where he abused \nillegal drugs, and has changed or avoided the environment where drugs were used. \nAfter breaking his patterns of drug abuse, he has changed his life, and has not routinely \nassociated with the drug abusing friends from his past. He has abstained from drug \nabuse for about two years. Moreover, he offered to provide \u201ca signed statement of intent \nwith automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs. The marijuana, cocaine and mushrooms were never prescribed for \nhim. He did not satisfactorily complete a prescribed drug treatment program, including \nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements.  \n \n                                                                                                                                             \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n11In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n  \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in August 2006, about two years \nago. The motivations to stop using drugs are evident.12 He understands the adverse \nresults from drug abuse. He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no \ndrug abuse to eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThere is considerable evidence supporting approval of his clearance. Applicant \nrevealed his drug abuse on his security clearance application, to an OPM investigator \non June 20, 2007, and at his hearing. Applicant used illegal drugs from 1997 to 2006. \nHe does not routinely associate with his drug-abusing friends. Now that he is in the \nworkforce, and in a job he really enjoys and treasures, the consequences of drug abuse \nwill be much more severe. He stopped using illegal drugs about two years ago. He \nknows the consequences if he resumes his drug abuse. He completed SARP. With \nrespect to excessive alcohol consumption, he no longer drives after drinking alcohol. \nAlthough he drinks alcohol to intoxication, he does not become extremely intoxicated. \nApplicant is a valued employee with excellent potential. There is no evidence at his \ncurrent employment of any disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or \nthat he would intentionally violate national security. His law-abiding character and good \nwork performance shows some responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His co-\nworkers, friends and supervisors support approval of his clearance. I am satisfied that \nhis current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and his current ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules and regulations show solid future potential for access to \nclassified information.  \n                                            \n12Retention of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a substantial problem with drug abuse for nine years. He abused \nmarijuana from 1997 to August 2006, using the substance approximately 50 times. He \nused cocaine five times from June 2001 to March 2006. He used mushrooms three \ntimes from January 2004 to September 2006. He was terminated from employment \nbecause he tested positive showing marijuana use in 2001. He did not attend any drug \ntreatment or counseling program. These serious drug problems are fully mitigated for \nthe reasons previously discussed. However, his problems with alcohol cannot be \nmitigated at this time. He has consumed alcohol to intoxication two or three times each \nmonth from approximately 1997 to the present. He had a DUI in 2003, and was \nterminated from employment in 2001 because beer was found at his work station. Even \nafter being informed that there was a security concern with drinking alcohol to \nintoxication in SOR \u00b6 1.a, he continued to drink alcohol to intoxication. His decision to \ncontinue to drink alcohol to intoxication was knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. \nHe was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Excessive alcohol \nconsumption shows a lack of judgment and/or impulse control. Such conduct raises a \nserious security concern, and a security clearance is not warranted at this time. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug involvement, but not alcohol consumption.    \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d13 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n13See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He submitted additional requested information concerning his previous\naddresses and employment on May 3, 2005. On December 16, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and elected to have his case decided\non the record in lieu of a hearing.

His wife resides outside of the U.S. He has worked for his current\nemployer (overseas) since June 2004 (Item 4). \nApplicant has worked out of the country for the past ten years or more. He had\nused his mother\u2019s address in the United States for his address of record. He has worked\nsteadily during his career except for noted unemployment from December 16, 2002 until\nJanuary 29, 2003 (Item 4). \nApplicant was interviewed overseas by a DoD investigator on April 2, 2007 as\npart of the security clearance investigation. He explained to the agent that he had not\nfiled his individual income tax returns for the years in question (1990, 11991, and 1992)\nbecause he had been out of the U.S. for 330 days and believed that he did not have to\nfile the taxes based on that fact and the amount of his income was below $80,000.2\nApplicant elaborated when he found out about the delinquent fees that he contacted the\nIRS. Applicant was told that ultimately he did not owe anything. He explained that he\nwould produce documentation that the debt has been cleared. Concerning the two\ndelinquent accounts (SOR \u00b6 1.b and \u00b6 1.c), Applicant did not know about the debt for\n$309 (medical services). He explained that the $273 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was due to a\ncancellation fee on a phone contract. He cancelled his contract early and told the\ncompany that he believed his pre-payment of $250 for mobile phone service would be\ncredited toward the cancellation fee. He never looked at his credit reports (Item 7).  \n\n3\nOn April 20, 2008, Applicant explained that in 1997, an IRS agent told him that a\ntax lien from 1996 in the amount of $45,444.28 had been filed against him. He learned\nabout this when he was on leave for a few days while visiting his mother in the U.S. He\nwas due to return overseas and could not file the tax forms immediately. He also\nexplained that his legal and professional papers were stored in a trunk in his mother\u2019s\nhome and had been misplaced. According to Applicant, the IRS had not initiated any\nother action against Applicant (Item 7).\nThe SOR alleges two delinquent debts, and a federal tax lien in taxes, penalties\nand interest for the tax years 1990, 1991, and 1992 (years that taxes were not filed) in\nthe amount of $45,444. The total amount of other debt that Applicant owes is\napproximately $582 (Item 8).\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: the taxes\nassessed for tax years 1990, 1991, and 1992 have been satisfied in the amount of\n$45,444. A Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien was prepared and signed on April\n22, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant submitted a Form 2848 (Power of Attorney and\nDeclaration of Representative), signed April 9, 2009. This allowed the designated\nperson (an enrolled agent) to represent Applicant before the IRS to resolve any tax\nissue regarding income for tax periods from 1989 until 2008.\nApplicant settled the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c in January 2009 for $163.81.\nHis credit report confirms the account as settled. Applicant also provided documentation\nof his cancelled check and payment coupon with his answer to the SOR. He explained\nin his answer to the SOR that when he signed his 2004 security clearance form, he did\nnot know that there was an outstanding balance as discussed above. He explained that\nhe paid it to avoid any further issues with the account (Item 3).\nApplicant\u2019s submissions to the FORM document his payment of $309 for the\nmedical bill (SOR \u00b6 1. b) on February 5, 2009. He did not realize that his hospital bill for\nan emergency visit in August 2003 was not covered by his employer as part of a\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation claim. He was told by the company that it was covered.\nApplicant explained that since it was showing on his credit report and to avoid any\nfurther issues, he paid it.  \nApplicant completed his June 2004 security application which had an addendum\nsigned on May 2005. In that application he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 38 and 39\nconcerning financial delinquencies in the last seven years for over 90 or 180 days (Item\n4).\nIn 2009, in his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that when he completed\nthe SF 86 in 2004 he did not know of the two delinquent accounts or that he had a\ncurrent \u201cjudgment\u201d filed against him. He elaborated in his answer to the SOR that his\n\u201csupposed indebtedness to the IRS in the amount of $45,444 for the years 1990, 1991,\nand 1992 is still an unresolved and outstanding issue (Item 3). When Applicant\ncompleted his June 2004 security clearance application, he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions\n\n4\n28 and 39: Your Financial Delinquencies. He incorrectly answered the questions but did\nnot falsify his application.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Also, AG \u00b6 19(g), \u201c failure to file annual Federal, state, or local\nincome tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on two accounts. He did not file\nfederal income tax returns for 1990, 1991, and 1992. A tax lien in the amount of\n$45,444 was filed on January 22, 1996. His credit reports confirm the debts. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant did\nnot file federal tax returns for 1990, 1991 and 1992 based on his belief that living and\nworking out of the country for 330 days out of a year and making less than $80,000 did\nnot require him to do so. He also had two delinquent accounts from August 2003 and\nSeptember 2003 that he did not realize were delinquent accounts. This mitigating\ncondition applies in this case. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ I do not find this a factor\nfo consideration in this case. \n\n6\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has resolved the federal tax lien. The two accounts\nare paid. His efforts are sufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude these\nmitigating conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that he did not\nbelieve he owed the tax lien based on working and living abroad and referred to a tax\nprovision for citizens living abroad. However, he has satisfied the lien. I conclude this\nmitigating condition applies in part.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2004 security application, he did not\nlist any delinquent debts in response to questions 38 and 39. He stated in his answer to\nthe FORM in 2009, that he answered the questions to the best of his ability and did not\nknow about the indebtedness. He incorrectly answered the questions but he did not\nintentionally falsify his application. He denied that he intentionally falsified his answers\nor attempted to deceive the Government. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission\n\n7\noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in\nISCR Case NO. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). Thus, 16(a) does not apply in\nthis case. I find for Applicant (SOR \u00b6 2.a-b).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the Government\u2019s case. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor\noverseas for approximately ten years. He is currently working overseas. He served in\nthe U.S. Army from 1971 until 1979. He did not file federal tax returns in 1990, 1991,\nand 1992 because he did not believe he was required to do so. He believed that he did\nnot owe any tax. He has resolved the tax lien in the amount of $45,444. He did not know\nthat two accounts from 2003 and 2004 were delinquent. He has paid the two delinquent\naccounts and provided documentation. He answered questions 38 and 39 concerning\nfinancial delinquencies in the last 7 years to the best of his ability. He did not falsify his\nSF 86. His answer and submissions to the FORM are sufficient for him to meet the\nburden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \nOn May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines C, Foreign Preference and Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 17, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on July 30, \n2008. After coordinating with both counsels, the case was scheduled on September 8, \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n2008, to accommodate Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s schedule. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on August 7, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled. The government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objections. The \ngovernment also offered Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through V, for administrative notice. \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibit (AE) A through N, which were admitted without \nobjections. Applicant also offered HE VI through IX. There was no objection and I took \nadministrative notice of HE I through IX. Three witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 17, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 2.b and admitted the \nremaining allegations in SOR. Her admissions and explanations are incorporated below. \nIn addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nI make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old business woman who owns her own company. Her \nonly client is the federal government. She was born and educated through college in \nTurkey. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering there in 1981. She later earned \nher master\u2019s degree in engineering administration from a prestigious American \nuniversity. She received stipends and tuition assistance from the U.S. Navy to assist her \nin earning her master\u2019s degree. Applicant has held a secret security clearance since \n1997.1  \n \n \nWhile living in Turkey, her father, a physician, owned an apartment building \nwhere she and her family lived. The remaining apartments were leased to the U.S. \nembassy and American military officers, foreign services officers, and diplomats resided \nthere. Applicant met her husband, a U.S. foreign service\u2019s officer, in Turkey, and they \nmarried in 1986. She was required to have a security background check before they \nmarried. Her husband held a security clearance at the time.2  \n \n \nIn 1987, Applicant and her husband were transferred to the U.S. Applicant \nobtained a green card and was a resident alien. Her husband received an assignment \nto Japan in 1989, and her application for U.S. citizenship was expedited so she could \nbecome a naturalized U.S. citizen prior to moving to Japan on his official orders. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 1989. She obtained a diplomatic passport upon their \ntransfer. While in Japan she taught at a U.S. university and assisted in organizing \nevents in support of her husband\u2019s position and to promote the U.S. They returned to \nthe U.S. in 1993.3  \n \n \n1 Tr. 40-42, 48, 77-78, 82. Applicant has owned her firm since 2001. \n \n2 Tr. 42-45. \n \n3 Tr. 45-50. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant and her husband divorced in 1999. They have two children, a son, who \nis 19 and attends college, and a daughter who is a senior in high school. Applicant has \nhad primary custody of the children since their divorce, and is on amicable terms with \nher ex-husband.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant became a U.S. citizen she retained her Turkish citizenship. She \nwas unaware that her dual citizenship status was an issue and divulged the status when \nshe first obtained her secret security clearance in 1997. She also divulged all of the \ninformation about her family and her foreign travel when she first obtained her security \nclearance. She was never made aware that her dual citizenship status jeopardized her \nsecurity clearance and has held a clearance without incident since first acquiring it. In \nJune 2008, after becoming aware that her dual citizenship status affected her security \nclearance, she formally renounced her Turkish citizenship. She testified that her security \nclearance is more important to her than remaining a Turkish citizen. She received \nconfirmation from the Turkish government of her renunciation. She does not believe she \nhas to take any other affirmative action to renounce. She believes the government of \nTurkey will check to see if she has any unfulfilled military duty, pending criminal charges \nor owes any money.4 She does not know how long it will take the government to \ncomplete the processing of her renunciation.5  \n \n \nThe reason Applicant did not renounce her Turkish citizenship status earlier was \nbecause of her father\u2019s ownership of the apartment building where she grew up. \nApplicant\u2019s father died in August 2007. When he passed away, by law, the property was \nto be divided in three shares, one to her mother, one to her brother, and one to her. \nApplicant renounced her one-third share.6 Her mother continues to live in the apartment \nbuilding, as does her brother. Applicant has formally rejected her inheritance rights and \ntransferred any of her property rights she has in the family apartment to her brother. \nApplicant\u2019s brother assisted her in divesting her property rights through the legal \nprocesses in Turkey. She formally transferred her property rights and future property \nrights to her brother. Her brother submitted the proper paperwork through the Turkish \ngovernment, on behalf of Applicant. She did not receive any consideration or anything \nof monetary value for her divestments. Applicant executed the appropriate documents \nto ensure she does not have any property rights in Turkey. When her mother dies \nApplicant will not be entitled to any inheritance rights because of her renunciation. She \nestimated that the potential worth of the property she divested was \u201ca couple hundred \nthousand dollars.\u201d7 When Applicant\u2019s security clearance became an issue, she \nrenounced her Turkish citizenship and inheritance rights because her security clearance \n \n4 Tr. 50-53; Answer to SOR, Exhibits A and B. Applicant testified that women do not have \nmandatory military duty. She does not have criminal charges pending, nor does she owe any taxes. \n \n5 Tr. 78-84, 94-95. \n \n6 At the time Applicant answered the SOR her father\u2019s estate was in probate and the property had \nnot yet been divested. Applicant affirmatively and formally renounced her rights to any inheritance.  \n \n7 Tr. 71; AE G, Answer to SOR Exhibit C. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nwas more important to her than her inheritance rights.8 Applicant does not own any \nproperty in Turkey and because she has renounced her Turkish citizenship she can not \nown property in Turkey.9 \n \n \nIn 1993, Applicant and her then husband spent $2,500 to buy a share of land in a \nco-operative agriculture venture. It was undeveloped land and they hoped that it would \nbe developed for a profit. There were 200 other investors. The property was never \ndeveloped. When Applicant and her husband divorced the property was transferred to \nher because he was not a citizen and could not own the property. Applicant obtained a \nlegal document that transferred the property to her brother because since she has \nrenounced her Turkish citizenship she can no longer own the property. He conducted a \ntitle search for Applicant to confirm she does not own any other property that might \naffect her ability to hold a security clearance.10  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 70 years old and lives in the family apartment. Her father \nowned the apartment until his passing in 2007. He was a military physician at the \nTurkish military academy until he retired about twenty years ago. He then went into \nprivate practice until he developed a debilitating disease. He received a pension and \nApplicant\u2019s mother now receives two-thirds of the pension. All pensions in Turkey are \nadministered through the government. Although Applicant\u2019s mother was educated to be \na lawyer, she never practiced and remained at home to care for her family. In addition to \nthe survivor\u2019s benefits from Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s pension, she also receives the rents \nfrom the apartments. Applicant calls her mother on the phone weekly. Her mother does \nnot know she has a security clearance and Applicant has never told her mother that she \nis divorced. She does not contribute money to her mother. The neighborhood where her \nmother lives is very secure and there have been no incidents of violence or terrorism.11  \n \n \nApplicant has a brother who is 44 years old and lives in the same apartment \nbuilding as their mother. He is a doctor in private practice with no connection to the \ngovernment. He is divorced and has a son who lives with his mother in the U.S. \nApplicant has no contact with her nephew or former sister-in-law. Applicant testified she \nis not close with her brother, but she did have him help her with the legal renunciations \nregarding her property and inheritance issues.12  \n \n \nApplicant has visited her mother 11 times since she left Turkey in 1987. One of \nher trips was a business trip where she was hired to help promote a state\u2019s business \ninterests. She has not voted in Turkey since becoming a U.S. citizen. She has voted in \nevery election in the U.S. since becoming a U.S. citizen, including by absentee ballot \n \n8 Answer to SOR, Exhibit C. \n \n9 Tr. 70-72, 99-102; Answer to SOR. \n \n10 Tr. 66-70; Answer to SOR. \n \n11 Tr. 53-62, 95-98. \n \n12 Tr. 60-62. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nwhen her family was stationed overseas. She used her Turkish passport only when \ntraveling to and from Turkey, because it was required by Turkey due to her dual \ncitizenship status, at the time. Applicant has destroyed her Turkish passport and \nreturned her Turkish identification card. She does not consider herself a dual citizen \nsince her formal renunciation.13 \n \n \nApplicant owns and operates her own business. All of her contracts are with the \nfederal government. She currently employs one full-time employee and six part-time \nemployees. Applicant owns her residence in the U.S., which she bought in 2001, and \nthe current value is approximately $1.46 million. The remaining balance on her \nmortgage is approximately $650,000. She also owns investment property in the U.S., \nwith an assessed value of approximately $703,000. She receives rental income from \nthis property. She has other investments and stock holdings. She estimates she earns \napproximately $6,080 every two weeks, or approximately $145,000 a year.14 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s business has had a facilities clearance since 2002. She has never \nhad a security incident, breach or been questioned about her security practices. She \nwas reinvestigated after her initial security clearance was granted in 1997, when her \ncompany received its facilities clearance.15  \n \n \nApplicant testified that her family has never been targeted and believes no \nTurkish citizen has ever been targeted for kidnapping or blackmailed by the government \nto obtain classified information. She testified if she were ever approached she would \ncontact the military secretary where she has a contract or the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that she has spent her entire adult life in the U.S. She \nwelcomed the entrepreneurial opportunity that the U.S. offered women. Although there \nwas doubt in Turkey that she could achieve her goals, she is grateful for the confidence \nthose in the U.S. showed in her. Her children were born in the U.S. and she loves her \nadopted country. She believes she has shown a loyal commitment to the U.S. \ndemonstrated by raising her children here. She not only made the commitment for \nherself, but also for her children.16 She credibly testified that she would never dishonor \nher children and the achievement she has earned while in the U.S.17  \n \n \nFour witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. One knew her when she lived in \nTurkey, is a retired military officer and was a tenant in her family\u2019s apartment house. \nAnother has worked with her on and off since 1995. Another has been a friend since \n \n13 Tr. 63-66, 102. \n \n14 Tr. 73-77; 80-82; AE A, B, C, H, I, J, K, L, M, and N. \n \n15 Tr. 84-86, 103. \n \n16 Answer to SOR. \n \n17 Tr. 91-92. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n1994. They all attested to her loyalty and love of her adopted country and her devotion \nto her family and her job. They also attested to her honesty and believe she is a \ntrustworthy person. None are aware of security breaches, problems or questions \nregarding Applicant. One witness testified that Applicant has a sincere pride in the U.S. \nand of what she has been able to accomplish in this country.18  \n \n \nThe fourth witness was the security facilities officer for a major component of the \nDepartment of Defense. He has had contact with Applicant for about three years. As \npart of his responsibilities he must maintain a database on security clearances. \nApplicant has had a contract to assist his office in maintaining the database. Whenever \nthere was a problem with the database she addressed it and got the system to run \nefficiently. He estimated that his office has contact with her weekly. He sees her \nregularly due to the nature of the system and its requirement for continued \nmaintenance. He was very satisfied with her work. He has not had any issues regarding \nher security clearance. There have never been any questions about her work. He was \naware of her dual citizenship status and later found out she had a Turkish passport. He \nassisted her in destroying her Turkish passport and witnessed her dropping it into a \nshredder. She has never expressed a preference for Turkey or been concerned for the \nsafety of her family in Turkey. He has no reason to question her trustworthiness.19 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband, a career foreign service officer, currently stationed \noverseas, provided a statement attesting to Applicant\u2019s loyalty. He considered her a \n\u201cstrong defender\u201d of the U.S. He was unaware of anything derogatory about Applicant \nthat would cause concern for continuing her security clearance.20 \n \n \nApplicant is the treasurer of her home owner\u2019s association, is a theater booster \nfor her daughter\u2019s high school, likes to garden and supports charitable organizations. \nShe also likes to ride her bike and writes software programs. 21 \n \nRepublic of Turkey22 \n \n \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary system and the \npresident\u2019s powers are not precisely defined and his influence depends on his \npersonality and political weight. Turkeys\u2019 primary political, economic, and security ties \nare with the West. It has been a member of NATO since 1952. The United States and \nTurkey have had a close relationship since 1947. Turkey cooperates closely with the \nU.S. on many security issues. \n  \n \n18 Tr. 106-130. \n \n19 Tr. 132-141; Answer to SOR, Ex.

There have been terrorist bombings \nin the past five years resulting in deaths. The targets have been religious, government, \ngovernment-owned, political, tourist and business locations throughout the country. In \naddition, leftist and Islamic terrorist groups have also targeted U.S. and Western \ninterests. Terrorist claimed connections with Al-Qaeda were responsible for suicide \nbombings in Istanbul in 2003. The potential for future terrorist attacks remains high. \n \n \nTurkey\u2019s judiciary is declared to be independent, but is in need of reform. The \nTurkish government generally respects the human rights of its citizens. However, there \nare some abuses among its security forces. There are other human rights abuses with \nrespect to detainees, criminal trials and personal freedoms.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: When an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered AG \u00b6 10 (a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege \nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a \ncurrent foreign passport; (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country.\u201d) Applicant was a dual citizen of Turkey and the United \nStates. She held a Turkish passport after becoming a U.S. citizen and used it to travel \nto Turkey. She retained her Turkish citizenship because of property and inheritance \nrights she had in Turkey. I find (a) applies. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11 (a) (\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 \ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship\u201d); (c) (\u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of \nforeign citizenship occurred before the individual  became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor\u201d) and (e) (\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d) Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship was \nnot based solely on her birth in a foreign country. She was born in Turkey and retained \nher Turkish citizenship after she became a U.S. citizen by using her Turkish passport \nwhen she traveled to Turkey. I find (a) does not apply. Applicant has formally renounced \nher Turkish citizenship. She submitted the official paperwork to the government of \nTurkey and they acknowledged her request in writing. I find (b) applies. Applicant \ndestroyed her Turkish passport and it was witnessed by a security manager. He testified \nto witnessing the destruction of the passport and provided a document attesting to the \ndestruction. Applicant is no longer considered a Turkish citizen and therefore is not \n\n \n9 \n \n \npermitted to own property or inherit property. She specifically divested herself by \nproviding her brother the appropriate formal legal documents to renounce any \ninheritance right she may have. I find (e) applies. Applicant also divested herself of \nproperty she owned and was other property she was entitled to through inheritance. \nShe was permitted to own property in Turkey and had inheritance rights by virtue of her \ncitizenship. By renouncing her Turkish citizenship and formally renouncing any \ninheritance rights she no longer can own property there and will not inherit any property. \nI find (c) applies. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: Foreign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d); (b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing  that information\u201d); and \n(e) (\u201ca substantial business interest , financial, or property interest in a foreign country or \nin any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d). Applicant\u2019s mother and brother are \ncitizen and residents of Turkey. She stays in regular contact with her mother. She is not \nclose to her brother, but has had contact recently to have him assist her in divesting her \nof her Turkish property interests. Applicant has traveled to Turkey numerous times since \nmoving to the U.S. to visit her family. One of her trips was to promote the business \ninterests of a state. I find (a) and (b) apply. \nApplicant owned a property interest as part of a cooperative in undeveloped land \nin Turkey. She also had an inheritance interest in an apartment building. I find (e) \napplies to Applicant\u2019s property and financial interests. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions for this security concern under \nAG \u00b6 8 and especially considered (a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationship with foreign \npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of \nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \n\n \n10 \n \n \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization and interests of the U.S.\u201d), (b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either \nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests\u201d), and (c) (\u201ccontact or communication \nwith foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d); and (f) (\u201cthe value or routine nature of \nthe foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to \nresult in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence manipulate, or pressure \nthe individual\u201d).  \nApplicant obviously has a close relationship with her mother. Although she does \nnot consider herself close to her brother, she has had contact with him recently to help \nher divest her property interests in Turkey. I find (c) does not apply because her contact \nwith her family in Turkey is more than casual and infrequent. I have also considered her \nfamilial relationships in the context of the country where they live. Turkey has been a \nlong standing ally of the U.S. and a member of NATO for more than fifty years. There is \nno evidence that Turkey exploits its citizens to gain access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a housewife and her brother is a doctor. There is nothing to \nsuggest that they would be placed in a position where Applicant would have to choose \nbetween the interests of her family over the interests of the U.S. I find (a) applies. I have \nalso considered Applicant\u2019s situation if there was a conflict of interest between the U.S. \nand the country where her family lives. Applicant has been a loyal American since 1989. \nShe supported her husband while stationed overseas in promoting the U.S. Her children \nwere born in the U.S. and she chose to raise them in this country, even after her \ndivorce. She is the owner and president of her own business and has had a security \nclearance for more than ten years. Applicant has substantial personal and professional \nassets, including real property and investments in the U.S. She does not have any \nfinancial interests in Turkey. Applicant clearly identifies herself as a successful \nAmerican business woman. I find there is no conflict of interest, but even if there was a \nconflict, Applicant\u2019s deep and long standing relationships and loyalties in the U.S. are \noutweighed by any conflict. I am confident she would \u201cresolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant identifies herself as an American. She has family \ncontacts in Turkey, a major ally of the U.S. and it is inconceivable to her that she would \njeopardize her children or her life in the U.S. in the event of a conflict. I find mitigating \ncondition (b) applies.  \nApplicant divested herself of property in Turkey and also divested herself of any \npresent or future inheritance rights in Turkey. Although the agricultural property was of \nnominal value, the rights she had in the apartment complex were substantial. She \nclearly and credibly testified that her American citizenship was more important to her \nthan the monetary value of her inheritance. She took legal action to renounce any rights \nshe might have had in any property she might have been entitled to in Turkey, present \nor future. Now that she is no longer a dual citizen of Turkey, she can not hold property, \n\n \n11 \n \n \nby law. She provided documented proof of her actions. I find (f) applies to the property \nand financial interests Applicant once had in Turkey.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a dual citizen of \nTurkey and the U.S. and held a security clearance for more than ten years. \nUnbeknownst to her this was a security issue. When she was made aware of the \npotential security implications, she destroyed her passport and renounced her Turkish \ncitizenship. Applicant maintains contact with her family in Turkey. None of them are in \npositions that create heighten risks. Turkey is a strong ally of the U.S. and a long \nstanding member of NATO. Applicant is embedded in the U.S. She is a successful \nbusiness woman who chose to raise her U.S. born children in the U.S. She has held a \nsecurity clearance without incident for many years. Her only ties remaining in Turkey \nare her mother and brother. Applicant relinquished property she owned in Turkey and \ndivested herself of her inheritance rights, including an interest in the apartment building \nher father owned. The property was worth a significant amount of money that she \nwillingly forfeited. Applicant has substantial investments in the U.S., including owning \nher own business, a house, investment real estate and other investments. It is clear that \nthere is little prospect that there would be a conflict of interests, but in remote event \nthere was, she would resolve it in favor of her adopted country, the U.S. She has deep \nties to the U.S. and her loyalty is unquestioned. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \narising from foreign preference and foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline B: \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.), four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.d.), and one allegation of disqualifying conduct under AG G, Alcohol Consumption (SOR \u00b6 3.a.). In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all eleven allegations in the SOR and provided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old and divorced. In 1994, she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mass communications. From approximately February 2001 until December 2003, Applicant worked for a defense contractor as a software trainer specialist. From December 2003, until the present, she has been employed by a government contractor in a senior position. In her current duties as an information technology manager, she leads and manages a team of 18 junior-level staff in two geographical locations. The team is responsible for installing new software systems for U.S. government civilian and military clients. Every two months, Applicant travels to supervise and manage one of her units in another state. She seeks a security clearance for the first time. (Ex. 1; Tr. 32-35, 105-107.) In January 2001, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DWI). She pled guilty to the charge and was convicted.

Hofffman, Esquire,  Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I \nconclude that Applicant mitigated security concerns under Guideline G, Alcohol \nConsumption, but she failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Her eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(EQIP) on November 18, 2005. On August 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn September 17, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing, provided \nadditional information, and requested that her case be decided on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing before an administrative judge. Pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.7., Enclosure 3, \nAdditional Procedural Guidance, of the Directive, Department Counsel requested a \nhearing in the matter. The case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009. I convened a \nhearing on May 4, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government called \nno witnesses and introduced seven exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 through 7 and \nadmitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf, called no \nother witnesses, and offered no exhibits for admission to the record.  \n \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on May 18, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal \nConduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.), four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG \nE, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.d.), and one allegation of disqualifying \nconduct under AG G, Alcohol Consumption (SOR \u00b6 3.a.). In her Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted all eleven allegations in the SOR and provided additional \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old and divorced. In 1994, she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin mass communications. From approximately February 2001 until December 2003, \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor as a software trainer specialist. From \nDecember 2003, until the present, she has been employed by a government contractor \nin a senior position. In her current duties as an information technology manager, she \nleads and manages a team of 18 junior-level staff in two geographical locations. The \nteam is responsible for installing new software systems for U.S. government civilian and \nmilitary clients. Every two months, Applicant travels to supervise and manage one of her \nunits in another state. She seeks a security clearance for the first time. (Ex. 1; Tr. 32-35, \n105-107.) \n \n \nIn January 2001, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol (DWI). She pled guilty to the charge and was convicted. The court sentenced \nher to 30 days confinement, which was suspended, and a $300 fine, plus court costs. \nAdditionally, she was required to attend a one-week alcohol safety awareness program \nand, over a period of three months, to attend nine meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. \nHer driver\u2019s license was restricted for one year. (SOR \u00b6 1.f.; Ex. 1; Ex. 6; Ex. 7; Tr. 42-\n49.) \n \n \nApplicant completed the alcohol awareness program and attended the required \nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings. She stated that she did not consider herself to be in \nas much danger from the use of alcohol as others in the program. She learned that a \nperson of her weight and body size could safely handle no more than two or three \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndrinks of alcohol at a time. She said that from the alcohol awareness program she \nlearned \u201cnot to go overboard\u201d in consuming alcohol. (Tr. 44-48.)  \n \n \nOn October 26, 2002, Applicant was married for the first time. In December 2002,    \nshe and her husband were arrested for domestic violence after she called the police \nduring a dispute with her husband. A magistrate ordered Applicant and her husband to \nremain apart for 24 hours. In January 2003, Applicant and her husband appeared in \ncourt and the charges against them were dismissed. They paid court costs of about \n$100. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.; Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Tr. 49-50.) \n \n \nLater in January 2003, Applicant and her husband were again arrested for \ndomestic violence. This arrest occurred after they had consumed alcohol in their home \nduring a party. Applicant had consumed approximately six to seven mixed drinks and \nbeer over a period of six to seven hours. The couple spent the night in jail and was \nreleased on bail. In February 2003, the court ordered Applicant and her husband to \ncomplete anger management counseling and to mark two years without another \nincident of domestic violence. Applicant and her husband attended the required eight-\nweek courses in anger management and successfully complied with the court\u2019s order. \nThe charges against them were dismissed in February 2005. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.; Ex. 2 at 11; \nEx. 4; Ex. 5.) \n \n \nIn addition to the court-ordered anger management training, Applicant and her \nhusband sought additional joint counseling to understand one another and to improve \ntheir marriage. Additionally, in 2002, Applicant suffered a miscarriage and lost twins.  \nFrom January 2003 until October 2004, they consulted two therapists on a weekly or bi-\nweekly basis. Applicant was also diagnosed and treated for depression by an aunt, who \nis a medical doctor and a psychiatrist. The aunt prescribed the anti-depressant \nWellbutrin for Applicant during 2003 and 2004. Applicant spoke on the telephone with \nher aunt approximately every two weeks from about 2002 to 2005 but did not receive \nany formal therapy from her. The aunt did not refer Applicant to another therapist for \ntreatment.  (Ex. 2 at 13-14; Tr. 84-91.))   \n \n \nApplicant also consulted with a third therapist in the period beginning January \n2005 and continuing until the summer of 2005.  She undertook this counseling because \nshe was planning to testify in a criminal trial affecting one of her siblings.  (Ex. 2 at 14; \nTr. 93-95.)   \n \n \nIn the summer of 2005, Applicant decided to end her marriage and file for \ndivorce.  Her parents learned of her plan, and they invited Applicant and her husband to \ntheir home to discuss their marriage and Applicant\u2019s personal behavior.  Applicant \nbecame angry during the discussion when her husband discussed private details of \ntheir marriage with her parents. She said to her husband: \u201cI could kill you for opening \nyour mouth.\u201d She picked up a framed picture of her family and threw it. Applicant\u2019s \nparents called the police, who came to the parents\u2019 home and arrested Applicant. The \npolice escorted her to a hospital, where she was interviewed by a social worker and \nadmitted to a psychiatric ward, where she remained for 48 hours. She was \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsubsequently evaluated and released. This incident contributed to Applicant\u2019s alienation \nfrom her parents.  She no longer has contact with them. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.; Ex. 3 at 4: Tr. 61-\n69.) \n \n \nIn September 2005, Applicant returned home after an evening out with a female \nfriend. She and the friend had been consuming alcohol, and the friend entered her \nhome with her. Applicant and her husband quarreled, and Applicant\u2019s husband called \nthe police, who subsequently issued Applicant a Warrant of Arrest for Misdemeanor \nAssault and Battery on a family member and granted Applicant\u2019s husband a Protective \nOrder against her. Applicant appeared in domestic relations court to answer the charge.  \nThe case was dismissed when Applicant\u2019s husband refused to proceed.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nand 1.b.; Tr. 69-72.)   \n   \n \nApplicant filed for separation from her husband in September 2005. The \nProtective Order granted to Applicant\u2019s husband expired in November 2005. Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce from her husband became final in March 2007. Applicant denies having an \nanger management problem. She believes her ex-husband drove her to bad behavior. \nDOHA alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. that the criminal conduct recited at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.f. also constitutes, under AG \u00b6 15, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that] can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.\u201d (Tr.  71-79.) \n \n \nOn November 18, 2005, Applicant completed and certified her e-QIP.  Section 23 \non the e-QIP asks that an applicant answer questions about his or her police record, \nand report any required information. If an applicant answers \u201cyes\u201d to a question in \nSection 23, he or she must provide an explanation for the affirmative answer.  Section \n23(f) reads: \u2018In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted \nof any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines \nof less that $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d \n \n \nIn response to Section 23(f), Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d and reported she had \nbeen arrested for Domestic Assault and Battery in January 2003.  She identified that \naction taken as: \u201cAttended Anger Management class. Upon completion of class, as \nmandated by court, the charge was placed in \u201cunknown\u201d status.  Both my husband and I \nare in good standing for two years with court/county.\u201d  (Ex. 1 at 26.) \n  \n \nIn answering Section 23(f), Applicant failed to identify and discuss the fact that in \nSeptember 2005, she was issued a Warrant of Arrest for Misdemeanor Assault and \nBattery on a family member. This charge was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. and admitted by \nApplicant in her Answer to the SOR and at her hearing. Applicant also failed to list her \narrest in July 2005 and subsequent incarceration in a hospital psychiatric ward for 48 \nhours, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. and her arrest in December 2002 for domestic violence, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. DOHA alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.b. that Applicant\u2019s failure to provide \nthis information was a deliberate falsification of her e-QIP. (Ex. 1; Answer to SOR; Tr. \n75-83.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nSection 21 on the e-QIP reads: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you consulted with a \nmental health professional (Psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you \nconsulted with another health care provider about a mental health related condition?\u201d \n \n \nApplicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question at Section 21.  She listed her marriage \ncounseling therapy with two therapists in 2003 and 2004. She failed to list her \nincarceration in a psychiatric ward and consultations there with mental health \nprofessionals, which was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. In SOR \u00b6 2.c., DOHA alleged that this \nomission constituted deliberate falsification of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP. (Ex. 1; Answer to SOR; \nTr. 82-84.)  \n \n \n  Applicant also failed to disclose that, from 2002 to about 2005, she consulted \nwith her aunt, who is a medical doctor and psychiatrist, and the aunt concluded she was \nsuffering from depression and prescribed the anti-depressant drug Wellbutrin, which \nApplicant took from 2003 to 2004.  In SOR \u00b6 2.d., DOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s failure \nto disclose this information constituted deliberate falsification of her E-QIP. Applicant \nsaid she did not list the treatment from her aunt because she communicated with her \naunt mainly by telephone, and she considered the consultations to be informal. She \nstated that she was also prescribed Wellbutrin between 2006 and 2007 by her \ngynecologist. (Tr. 95-96.) \n \n \nDOHA alleged under SOR \u00b6 3.a. that the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.d., and 1.f. also constituted disqualifying conduct under Guideline G, Alcohol \nConsumption. \n \n \nWhen the conduct alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.c. occurred, Applicant was \nworking for her current employer. She did not tell her facility security officer about these \nevents, nor did she inform her supervisor. She does not believe that anyone in her \nworkplace knows of the SOR allegations. She did not reveal or acknowledge the \nconduct alleged in the SOR until she met with an authorized investigator for a personal \nsubject interview on May 31, 2007. Her direct supervisor was not aware that she was \nappearing at her DOHA hearing. None of her supervisors have asked her if she had \nissues that could make her vulnerable as a leader in the organization. (Tr. 80-83,104, \n107.) \n \n \nSince separating from her husband in September 2005, Applicant has not had \nany arrests for criminal conduct or alcohol-related conduct.  She is in a relationship with \na man with whom she hopes to have children. He does not drink alcohol at all. She is \nundergoing hormone treatments in anticipation of pregnancy. She has not taken \nWellbutrin since 2007.  (Tr. 27-29, 109, 115-120.) \n \n \nApplicant stated that her most recent use of alcohol occurred one month ago \nwhen she had one glass of wine.  The last time she was drunk was in December 2008. \nShe does not believe that she has a problem with alcohol.  (Tr. 40-41.) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel asked Applicant this question: \u201cIf you \nstarted to feel like you were losing control again, would you want to check with the \ndoctor and get back on the anti-depressant?\u201d \n \nApplicant responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d \n \n(Tr. 99.) \n \n                                                           Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n7 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n            Guideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b630. \n \n \n \nApplicant admits a criminal history that that includes a DWI in 2001 and arrests \nfor domestic violence and assault in 2002, 2003, and 2005.  In 2005, after threatening to \nkill her husband, she was arrested and incarcerated in a hospital psychiatric ward for 48 \nhours. She has not been arrested for any criminal behavior since her separation from \nher husband in September 2005.  \n \n \nIn addition to her criminal history, Applicant admits deliberately falsifying her e-\nQIP in November 2005 by concealing her criminal conduct and mental health treatment \nhistory. Applicant\u2019s criminal history and her deliberate falsification of that history on her \nsecurity clearance application raise concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) and AG \u00b6 31(c). AG \u00b6 \n31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \n\u201dallegation or admission or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \n \nThe record demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior between 2001 and \n2005 was serious and substantial. She had serious problems with controlling her anger. \nShe has not been arrested or charged with criminal behavior since separating from her \nhusband in September 2005. Applicant\u2019s managers and supervisors have entrusted her \nwith leading and managing the work of approximately eighteen junior-level staff \nmembers working in two geographical locations. None of Applicant\u2019s direct supervisors \nand managers knows of her history of criminal conduct.  She has not reported this \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct to her facility security officer. Her direct supervisor is unaware of the allegations \nin the SOR.  \n \n \n \nIn November 2005, Applicant deliberately falsified her e-QIP by concealing and \nfailing to report her criminal behavior which occurred in 2002 and 2005, her \nincarceration in a psychiatric ward for a mental health evaluation in 2005, and the \nmental health treatment she received from her aunt, who is a psychiatrist. Her \nunwillingness or inability to inform the government of her past criminal behavior and \nmental health treatment raises concerns about her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Additionally, her deliberate falsifications and her unwillingness to be candid \nabout her past behavior with her managers and supervisors suggest a failure in \nrehabilitation. I conclude that while AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply in part to mitigate \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurring between 2001 and 2005, they do not apply to    \nthe deliberate falsification of her November 2005 e-QIP and her concealment of her \ncriminal behavior and mental health treatment until confronted by an authorized \ninvestigator in May 2007. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and certified her e-QIP in 2005, she deliberately \nfailed to report her past criminal behavior involving assault and battery of a family \nmember, threatening to kill her husband in 2005, and domestic violence in 2003. \nAdditionally, she failed report her incarceration in a psychiatric ward for threatening to \nkill her husband in September 2005 and her mental health treatment by a family \nmember who was a psychiatrist.  That treatment included a diagnosis of depression and \nthe prescription of an anti-depressant drug. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted that \nher failure to disclose this information was deliberate falsification of material facts. At \nher hearing, she denied a current problem with anger management. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto inform her facility security officer and her managers of her criminal history suggests \nshe wanted to hide her conduct from them and from the government. \n \n \nThe allegations in the SOR raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a) and AG \u00b6 \n16(e)(1). AG \u00b6 16(a) reads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d .\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) reads: \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of \n\n \n9 \n \n \ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, \nor duress, such as. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . .\u201d \n \n \n \nSeveral Guideline mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a) if \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d If \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, \nomission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security process\u201d and \u201c[u]pon being made aware of \nthe requirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated fully and \ncompletely,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) might apply if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e) might apply if \n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d   \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on the e-QIP she signed and \ncertified in November 2005. Nothing in the record suggests that she took prompt good \nfaith action to correct the omissions, concealments or falsifications before she was \nconfronted with the facts and addressed them in her personal subject interview in May \n2007. (AG \u00b6 17(a).)  Nothing in the record suggests that her failure to report her criminal \nbehavior and relevant psychiatric treatment was caused or significantly contributed to by \nimproper or inadequate advice specifically about the security clearance process from \nauthorized individuals or legal counsel. (AG \u00b6 17(b).) When she executed her security \nclearance application, Applicant knew she had a record of criminal behavior and failure \nto control and manage her anger. She also had reason to know that this behavior was \nnot minor, so remote in time, so infrequent, or had occurred under such unique \ncircumstances that it would not seriously raise concerns about her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment and perhaps impact her eligibility for a security \nclearance. (AG 17(c).) Applicant failed to provide documentation that she had taken \npositive steps that might alleviate the circumstances that caused her unreliable conduct \nand, as a result, such behavior was unlikely to recur. (AG \u00b6 17(d).) Nothing in the record \nsuggests that Applicant took positive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress that her behavior caused. (AG \u00b6 17(e).) I conclude, \ntherefore, that none of the applicable personal conduct mitigating conditions applies to \nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, applies in this case to a determination of \neligibility for access to classified information. Under Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability.\u201d \n \n I have considered all of the Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions.  I \nhave especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). AG \u00b6  22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent.\u201d   \n \nApplicant admitted alcohol consumption that led to a DWI in 2001.  Additionally, \nApplicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol resulted in domestic violence between her and her \nhusband in 2003 and 2005. These facts raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and \n22(c). \n \nThe Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(a) if \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The disqualifying \nconduct could also be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(b) if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d  If \u201cthe individual is a current \nemployee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of \nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress,\u201d then AG \u00b6 23(c) \nmight apply.  Finally, mitigation might be possible under AG \u00b6 23 (d) if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct occurred in her adult years, when she was in \nher late 20s and early 30s. Her alcohol use with her former husband triggered anger \nshe was not able to control and resulted in domestic violence. Since separating from her \nhusband in 2005, Applicant drinks alcohol in moderation, although she admitted drinking \nto intoxication once in December 2008. Since her separation and divorce from her \nhusband, she has not been cited for alcohol offenses. The man with whom she is \n\n \n11 \n \n \ncurrently involved in a domestic relationship does not drink alcohol, and alcohol does \nnot appear to play a significant part in her current domestic relationship. She has not \nbeen diagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an abuser of alcohol. I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n23(a) applies in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case and that AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b), 23(c), \nand 23(d) do not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \nDuring her marriage, Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol with her husband fueled anger   \nthat erupted into domestic violence. Since her separation and divorce, she has \nmoderated her use of alcohol and now uses it responsibly. She has not been diagnosed \nas an alcohol abuser or as alcohol dependent, nor has she been arrested for alcohol-\nrelated behavior since her separation from her husband in September 2005. After \napplying the Guideline G disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and after weighing \nApplicant\u2019s past and current use of alcohol in light of the whole person concept, I \nconclude that she has mitigated security concerns deriving from the alcohol \nconsumption adjudicative guideline.  \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has been entrusted with management and \nleadership responsibilities by her supervisors. For her part, however, she has not \nshared with them or with her security officer events in her life which could make her \nvulnerable to pressure and which could impact her capacity to lead others and to protect \nclassified information.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant completed an e-QIP and deliberately failed to report past \ncriminal behavior and incarceration for violent behavior, thereby creating a situation that \ncould seriously mislead the government when it seeks to evaluate her honesty, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Her falsifications were not minor: they went to the heart \nof her capacity for truthfulness, a critical qualification for one who would hold a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s failure to be truthful was deliberate. She made no effort to correct \nher falsifications between November 2005 and May 2007, when the government \nconfronted her with her lack of candor. Her deliberate falsifications are recent. I \nconclude that Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under the criminal conduct \nand personal conduct adjudicative guidelines. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \ncriminal conduct and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:             \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n                                 Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On August 21, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \nFebruary 5, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n her.  \n                                                          \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because her SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 2, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated September 29, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 2, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard on December 8, \n2008. It was reassigned to me on January 5, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A \nNotice of Hearing was issued on January 12, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as \nscheduled, on January 29, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, eight Government exhibits and ten Applicant exhibits were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was \nreceived on February 4, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted eleven of the factual allegations \nin \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.e. through 1.m. of the SOR.  She denied all other allegations.  \nDepartment Counsel conceded the presence of satisfactory mitigation pertaining to \u00b6 \n1.d.1 \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she is seeking \nto obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged. She was \npreviously granted a SECRET clearance on two occasions.  The first time was in the \nearly 1990s, but that clearance was lost when she was laid off.2 The second time was in \nSeptember 1998,3 but that clearance was revoked in November 2004, due to financial \nreasons.4  She was married from 1984 until 1993,5 and has three children, born in \n1984, 1989, and 1990, respectively.6 Her three children, a son-in-law, and her former \nfather-in-law, all presently reside with\n7\n \n1 Tr. at 14. \n \n2 Id. at 59. \n  \n3 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated  June 18, 2007), at 32. \n \n4 Id. at 33; Tr. at 59. \n \n5 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 3, at 16.  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant has been gainfully employed by the same defense contractor, in a \nvariety of positions, from November 1997 until the present, and currently serves as a \nmaterial coordinator.8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were apparently unremarkable until about 1994, when she \nwas laid off and her former spouse stopped making the court-ordered child support \npayments.9 In an effort to improve her employment opportunities she enrolled in a \nvocational or technical school and completed her training in March 1995.10 Additionally, \nto reduce expenses, she moved back into her ex-spouse\u2019s residence (he was a truck \ndriver on the road) with their children, but that situation did not work out, so they \neventually relocated in 1998.11 With the arrearage of over $30,000.00 in child support \npayments from her former spouse,12 and with mounting expenses, she experienced \nfinancial difficulties which resulted in accounts becoming delinquent and being \u201ccharged \noff\u201d and/or placed for collection. In addition, Federal tax liens were placed on their \nproperty on several occasions. \n \nIn 2004, when presented with a list of delinquent accounts by an investigator of \nthe Defense Security Service, Applicant pledged to contact those creditors and arrange \npayment \u201cwhen money becomes available.\u201d13 She stated the money would have to \ncome from the child support arrearage.14  \n \nThe SOR identified thirteen purportedly continuing delinquencies, but Applicant \ncontends several of the accounts alleged have current payment arrangements; some \nhave been satisfied or otherwise resolved; and some were not her responsibility. Her \ncontentions have merit. The evidence and information offered by the Government \nconsists, in large measure, of four credit reports and written and oral statements made \nby Applicant. Additional credit reports, along with financial records and correspondence \nwith creditors, as well as official court records, were offered in support of Applicant\u2019s \ncase. The thirteen debts listed in the SOR, and their respective purported current status, \naccording to the credit reports, financial records and correspondence with creditors, as \nwell as Applicant\u2019s comments regarding same, are described below: \n \n \n6 Id. at 20-21.  \n \n7 Id. at 27. \n \n8 Id. at 14. \n \n \n9 Government Exhibit 7 (Statement, dated July 28, 2004) at 2. \n \n10 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 3, at 12. \n \n11 Government Exhibit 7, supra note 9, at 2. \n \n12 Id. \n \n13 Id. at 3. \n \n14 Id. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nTYPE DEBT \nAMOUNT \nSTATUS \n1.a. \nJoint credit card \n$3,271.00 \nCharged off Aug 1997. \n(no longer on credit \nreports) Applicant will  \npay \nwhen \ncreditor \nresponds to her written \ninquiry of Dec 2008. \n1.b. \nJoint charge account \n$487.00 \nCollection Feb 2002. \nPaid \nJul \n2008. \n(no \nlonger \non \ncredit \nreports) \n1.c. \nJoint charge account \n$2,173.00 \nCollection Mar 1997. \nApplicant sent creditor \nwritten \ninquiry \nDec \n2008, but no response. \n(no longer on credit \nreports) \n1.d. \nFederal tax lien for 1985, 1987,1988 \n$7,833.31 \nLien released.  \n1.e. \nMedical (original creditor unknown) \n$939.00 \nCollection Aug 2006 \u2013 \nNegotiated \nbalance \npaid Nov 2008. \n1.f. \nMedical  \n$33.00 \nCollection Jul 2001 \u2013\nPaid Nov 2008. \n1.g. \nMedical  \n$74.00  \nCollection Jul 2001 \u2013\nPaid Nov 2008. \n1.h. \nMedical \n$231.00  \nCollection Mar 2006 \u2013\nPaid Nov 2008. \n1.i. \nMedical \n$58.00 \nCollection Mar 2006 \u2013\nPaid Nov 2008. \n1.j. \nMedical \n$750.00 \nCollection Mar 2005 \u2013\nPaid Dec 2008. \n1.k. \nHospital \n$50.00 \nCollection Oct 2002 \u2013\nPaid Jan 2009. \n1.l. \nMedical \n$156.00 \nCollection Jan 2002 \u2013\nPaid Nov 2008. \n1.m. \nJoint home mortgage \n$0.00 \nForeclosure Apr 2005 \n\u2013 Zero balance. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. refer to joint credit cards or charge accounts which \nwere either charged off (\u00b6 1.a.) or sent to collection (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c.).

When Applicant initially purchased her residence she was under \nthe impression that she had obtained financing with a fixed monthly payment of \n$660.00.  After she had been in the house for three years, to her surprise, the monthly \nrate increased to $900.00.25 Although she attempted to work with the bank to refinance \nthe loan to conditions more favorable to her, and within her ability to pay, the bank \nrefused to work with her.  Eventually, in about April 2005, the bank foreclosed on the \nmortgage, but there was no deficiency owed by her.26  \n \nApplicant has resided in another residence for the past three years. It is presently \nowner-financed, with her payments going toward her anticipated purchase of the \nproperty.  Once she receives clear title, she intends to refinance the property to pay off \nany continuing debts.27 \n \nIn September 2001, Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement which \nreflected a gross monthly salary of $1,938.04; a net monthly income of $2,924.28; total \nmonthly expenses of $2,757.00; and a balance of about $167.00 in discretionary funds \navailable for her use.28  Her financial condition has substantially improved since then.  \nOn January 27, 2009, she completed another Personal Financial Statement, and it \nreflects a gross monthly salary of $3,503.91; a net monthly income of $2,961.30; total \nmonthly expenses of $1,839.00; and a balance of about $1,122.30 in discretionary \nfunds available for her use.29 As a \u201csingle mother\u201d raising three children, and after \n\u201cignoring\u201d her debts for a number of years because of her former financial situation,30 \ndespite having received no financial or credit counseling,31 the changed financial \ncircumstances have allowed her to commence paying off her debts and enabled her to \nstart saving money.32 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n \n \n25 Tr. at 48. \n \n26 Id. at 49. \n \n27 Id. at 49-50. \n \n28 Personal Financial Statement, dated September 10, 2001, attached to Government Exhibit 2. \n \n29 Applicant Exhibit J (Personal Financial Statement, dated January 27, 2009). \n \n30 Tr. at 17. \n \n31 Id. at 57. \n \n32 Id. at 56-57. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d33 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \n33 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. The evidence is sufficient to substantiate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.m.  \n \nThe Government attributes substantial importance and credibility to entries in the \nvarious credit reports in evidence.34 I have reviewed them, and even with extensive \nexperience in deciphering the entries, found them generally to be garbled and internally \ninconsistent, with minimum indicia of reliability. There is no indication as to the source(s) \nof the information appearing therein, for as one Equifax Credit Report states, the entries \nare derived from \u201cpublic records or other information\u201d without identifying the \u201cother \ninformation.\u201d35 It provides even less information about the sources of the derogatory \nfinancial information. The other individual or combined reports offer little additional \nuseful information. \n \nFor a substantial period of time, Applicant did experience an inability to keep up \nwith the payments on her various accounts and mortgage.  Her financial condition was \nnot caused by an extravagant lifestyle, substance abuse, or gambling issues, but was \nexacerbated because she was a single mother of three children trying to raise them \nwithout the child support her ex-spouse was required to pay. The arrearage of over \n$30,000.00 in child support would have enabled her to avoid her financial difficulties. \nNevertheless, her delay until 2008-09 in commencing to pay off the delinquent balances \nconstitutes a history of not meeting financial obligations. Her actions are sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.  \n \nHowever, the issue pertaining to the federal tax lien is a different matter. The \nfederal tax lien was filed against Applicant and her ex-spouse by the IRS in 1990, refiled \n \n34 The Appeal Boad has previously determined that credit reports are sufficient to establish a prima facie \ncase that an Applicant has SOR-identifed delinquent debts that are of security concern.  ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at \n3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \n35 Government Exhibit 3 (Credit Report, dated February 26, 2008), at 1. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nonce, and eventually released. The IRS indicated there is a zero balance. The evidence \nof record, Applicant\u2019s contentions, and Department Counsel\u2019s concession that the \nallegation has been mitigated, in the absence of any contrary evidence, satisfies me \nthat this allegation has been mitigated.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \ninability to make her monthly payments on various accounts, and the absence of actual \npayments or repayment arrangements until 2008-09, is the single most potentially \ntroublesome issue. While Applicant\u2019s three children are now over 21 and she is no \nlonger responsible for supporting them, they do continue to reside with her, along with \none son-in-law and her former father-in-law. Also, Applicant\u2019s improved financial \ncondition, the fact that she has already paid off all but two accounts, and the wisdom, \nmaturity, and greater understanding of her financial responsibilities, makes it less likely \nthat the behavior will recur. I find AG \u00b6 20(a) applies in this case.  \n \nLikewise, under AG \u00b6 20(b), when \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d there may be potential \nmitigation.  Applicant was impacted by not only one of those conditions, but by three of \nthem almost simultaneously. She was laid off, encountered several medical \nemergencies, and went through a separation and eventual divorce, all of which took a \ntoll on her ability to avoid financial difficulties.  Added to that cornucopia of contributing \ndifficulties was her ex-spouse\u2019s failure or refusal to comply with his court-mandated \nchild support responsibilities.  In the absence of those problems, her financial difficulties \nmight never have occurred.  Accordingly, I find AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in this case. \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). In this instance, the first section of AG & 20(c) \nis not in issue for there is no evidence of Applicant having received counseling for \nfinancial issues. However, there are clear indications that her financial issues have been \nresolved or are under control.  Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nAthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@36 Applicant generally has a monthly balance of about $1,122.30 in \n \n36 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \ndiscretionary funds available for her use. She previously paid off nine of the alleged \ndebts; has mitigated the federal tax issue; relinquished her foreclosed residence to the \ncreditor, with no deficiency owed by her; is engaged in purchasing her current \nresidence; and has taken the first steps toward resolving the two remaining delinquent \naccounts identified in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.c.), with the clear intention of satisfying \nany remaining balances. Her actions in addressing her debts indicate good-faith efforts \non her part as well as showing clear indications the problem is now largely under \ncontrol.  I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has taken affirmative \naction and made substantial good-faith efforts to pay off or resolve her legitimate \ndelinquent debts, including those raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) While it \nis the Government\u2019s contentions that she still has two outstanding debts identified in the \nSOR, those debts are being addressed by her. Thus, these debts cannot be sources of \nimproper pressure or duress.  (See AG & 2(a)(8).)  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts are resolved; it is whether \nher financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security \nclearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put \nApplicant\u2019s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of \n \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

(See AG & 2(a)(1).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

She has worked for her current employer since 1997. Her current position or job title is director of emerging technology. Her primary responsibility is to scout, fund, and direct research. Her educational background includes an M.B.A. degree awarded by a U.S. university in 1996. The two letters of recommendation indicate that Applicant is a highly valuable, professional employee who performs important work (Exhibits B and C). Applicant was born in Turkey in 1952. She married in 1976, and the marriage took place in Turkey. She and her husband claim dual citizenship with Turkey and the U.S. She became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1995, and her husband did so in 1990. She and her husband have lived at the same address in the U.S. since 1984. They have one child, a son, born in the U.S. in 1986. She has no intention of renouncing her U.S. citizenship, and she has no intention of renouncing her Turkish citizenship (Exhibit 7). Foreign Preference Allegations SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Turkey and the U.S. Applicant admits the allegation in her Answer.

For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nAugust 28, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n3\nherein. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n4\n Id. \n5\n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR is dated May 14, 2008, and she elected a\ndecision without a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on the written\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. \nOn June 6, 2008, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant on June 10, 2008, and it was\n3\nreceived by her June 23, 2008. She replied to the FORM within the allowed 30-day\nperiod, and her reply consists of the following: (1) a two-page letter in rebuttal to the\nFORM; and (2) two letters of recommendation supporting her application for a security\nclearance. Those matters are admitted as Exhibits A, B, and C, respectively. The case\nwas assigned to me on August 4, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nFirst, the government included in its FORM as an item of documentary evidence\nan account of an interview of Applicant (Exhibit 7). The interview was part of a report of\ninvestigation (ROI) prepared by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The ROI\nindicates that the Applicant\u2019s interview was an unsworn declaration made in August\n2007. \nThe general rule is that a background ROI may not be received and considered\nby an administrative judge.  The exception to the general rule is \u201c[a]n ROI may be\n4\nreceived with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the\nFederal Rules of Evidence.\u201d  \n5\nIn past cases, the government included an ROI in its FORM without an attempt to\nauthenticate it or offer some other method of getting the evidence to the trier of fact (for\nexample, stipulation). The ROI was excluded from consideration in those cases. Here,\nthe government authenticated the ROI through Applicant. In particular, in about\n\n FORM at 3\u20135. \n6\n3\nFebruary 2008, it issued an interrogatory asking Applicant to review the ROI and state if\nit accurately reflected the information she provided during the interview (Exhibit 7).\nApplicant indicated it did not; she explained that it was necessary to correct the\ninterview when it referred to inherited property by changing the phrase \u201cmy father\u201d to\n\u201cmy family.\u201d With that correction, she considered the interview correct. Accordingly, with\nthe correction duly noted and without objections, the ROI is admitted as a business\nrecord or a public record or both and it will be considered.\nSecond, in its FORM, the government requested that official or administrative\nnotice be taken of certain facts about the country of Turkey.  Accordingly, without\n6\nobjections, the request is granted and notice is taken of certain facts about Turkey as\nset forth in the request.  \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for\nher current employer since 1997. Her current position or job title is director of emerging\ntechnology. Her primary responsibility is to scout, fund, and direct research. Her\neducational background includes an M.B.A. degree awarded by a U.S. university in\n1996. The two letters of recommendation indicate that Applicant is a highly valuable,\nprofessional employee who performs important work (Exhibits B and C). \nApplicant was born in Turkey in 1952. She married in 1976, and the marriage\ntook place in Turkey. She and her husband claim dual citizenship with Turkey and the\nU.S. She became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1995, and her husband did so in\n1990. She and her husband have lived at the same address in the U.S. since 1984.\nThey have one child, a son, born in the U.S. in 1986. She has no intention of\nrenouncing her U.S. citizenship, and she has no intention of renouncing her Turkish\ncitizenship (Exhibit 7). \nForeign Preference Allegations\nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Turkey and the\nU.S. Applicant admits the allegation in her Answer. In addition, it is established by the\ninformation in her security-clearance application and interview (Exhibits 5 and 7).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b and \u00b6 1.c concern Applicant\u2019s possession and use of a Turkish\nidentification card. She admits the former and denies the later allegation with an\nexplanation. In her August 2007 interview, Applicant stated that she does not have a\nvalid Turkish passport as it expired several years ago and she has not renewed it\n(Exhibit 7). She does have a Turkish identification card (Exhibit 6) that she said is\n\n4\nsimilar to an American social security card. She uses it with her U.S. passport to enter\nTurkey as the card is accepted in lieu of a visa. The card also gives Applicant a tax\nadvantage for real estate taxes in Turkey, but she says the advantage is minor in\nrelation to her net worth. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant intends to exercise her right as a Turkish citizen\nto buyout a portion of her son\u2019s Turkish military obligation, as he is a dual citizen too.\nShe denied this allegation in her Answer. She explained that her son intends to exercise\nhis right as a Turkish citizen to buyout the remainder of his Turkish military obligation\nafter he serves a maximum of six weeks of military training. Also, she explained that her\nson will use his own resources to do so. Based on her explanation, this allegation is\nunproven. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant maintains citizenship with Turkey to protect her\nrights to her financial and business interests in Turkey. Applicant admits this allegation\nin her Answer. \nForeign Influence Allegations\nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c concern financial and property\ninterests in Turkey and will be addressed together. Applicant, individually or jointly with\nher husband, owns property (land and an apartment) in Turkey. The apartment is used\nas a rental property. Also, Applicant has about $150,000 (the balance varies) in a\nTurkish bank, as the money is from the rental property. \nIn her rebuttal letter, Applicant stated that the she may, in the future, use the\nproperty in Turkey as a vacation home for part of the year (Exhibit A). But she further\nexplained that she and her husband are uncertain that they would desire to maintain a\npart-time residence in Turkey because of the deteriorating political and religious\nsituation there, that the U.S. is their home, and they have three residences in two states\nin the U.S.  Also, she estimated that more than 75% of her financial assets are in the\nU.S., 10% are in Canada (based on partial ownership of an apartment building), and\nabout 15% are in Turkey. Most of the assets in Turkey were inherited.\nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges Applicant traveled to Turkey for pleasure in 1998, 2002, 2004,\n2006, and 2007. Applicant admits this allegation in her Answer. Applicant addressed her\nforeign travel in her August 2007 interview and indicated that she has never had any\nproblems with law enforcement, immigration, custom, or other officials during her trips\nabroad (Exhibit 7). \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n7\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n8\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n9\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n16\n5\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.7\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n8\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n9\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about\n10\nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved\nin favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n11\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n12\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n13\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n14\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n17\n Revised Guidelines at 7\u20138 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 7. \n19\n Revised Guidelines at 7. \n20\n Revised Guidelines at 7\u20138. \n21\n6\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n17\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline C for foreign preference,  a security concern may arise \u201c[w]hen\n18\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d19\nThe most pertinent disqualifying condition here is DC 1, which provides that a\nsecurity concern may exist and be disqualifying based on the \u201cexercise of any right,\nprivilege, or obligation or foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through\nforeign citizenship of a family member.\u201d  DC 1 applies to Applicant based on her active\n20\nexercise of Turkish citizenship after she became a U.S. citizen in 1995. Since then, she\nhas possessed and used a Turkish identification card, which is a right or privilege of\nTurkish citizens. She has benefitted from doing so by avoiding a visa when she travels\nto Turkey and enjoys a real estate tax advantage. She maintains her Turkish citizenship\nto protect her financial and property interests in Turkey. These circumstances fall within\nthe meaning of DC 1 of the guideline.  \nThe guideline contains conditions that may mitigate the security concern.  I\n21\nreviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude that none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nHer possession and use of the Turkish identification card since becoming a U.S. citizen\nconstitutes the active exercise of dual citizenship. In other words, this is not a case of\nmere passive dual citizenship. Her exercise of dual citizenship is current and ongoing,\nand there is no indication things will change in the future. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 5\u20136 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n22\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 5. \n23\n Revised Guidelines at 5. \n24\n Revised Guidelines at 6. \n25\n7\nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,  a security concern may arise due to\n22\nforeign contacts and interests \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization,\nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest.\u201d  \n23\nThe most pertinent disqualifying condition here is DC 5, which provides that a\nsecurity concern may exist and be disqualifying based on \u201ca substantial business,\nfinancial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-\noperated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d  DC 5 applies to Applicant based on property (land and an\n24\napartment) and bank account in Turkey. She estimates the value of these assets at\nabout 15% of her net worth. Although 15% is less than a majority of her assets, 15% is\nof considerable size, importance, or worth, and it is enough to raise a security concern.\nHer travel to Turkey is not particularly significant, but it does show her ongoing ties or\nconnections to that country.  \nThe guideline contains conditions that may mitigate the security concern.  I\n25\nreviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude that none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHer ownership of property in Turkey and six-figure bank account in Turkey are current\nand ongoing. She estimates the value of these interests at 15% of her net worth, which\nis too large to be considered minimal and unlikely to affect her security suitability. \nTo sum up, Applicant has ties and connections to both the U.S. and Turkey, her\ncountry of birth. The clear majority of those ties and connections are to the U.S. But her\nties and connections to Turkey are not insignificant as evidenced by her possession and\nuse of the Turkish identification card and her property and bank account in Turkey.\nThese ties and connections are ongoing and there is no indication things will change in\nthe future. Indeed, the evidence shows this is a case of divided interests because\nApplicant has one foot in Turkey and one foot in the United States. Although she\nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1995, she continues to exercise the rights and privileges of\nTurkish citizenship. Although her situation is not illegal or immoral, her ties and\nconnections to Turkey are not clearly consistent with the national interest of the U.S.\nAccordingly, Guidelines B and C are decided against Applicant. \nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion\nto obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person\n\n8\nconcept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable\ndecision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to sensitive information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on \nMarch 18, 2007. On June 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary \ndecision to deny her application, citing trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F and \nE. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nOctober 16, 2008\n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 17, 2008; answered it on \nJuly 15, 2008; and requested a decision on the record without a hearing. Department \nCounsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on August 27, 2008. On August 28, \n2008, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, \nwho was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on \nSeptember 3, 2008, and responded on September 23, 2008. DOHA received her \nresponse on September 29, 2008, and Department Counsel did not object to my \nconsideration of her response. The case was assigned to me on October 7, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the delinquent debts alleged \nunder Guideline F. In response to the allegations of falsifying her two SF 85P \nquestionnaires, she admitted giving negative answers to the questions about delinquent \ndebts but claimed she misunderstood the questions. Her admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor providing health care \nservices to military personnel and their families. She has worked for her current \nemployer since November 2004. She previously worked for another defense contractor \nat the same military installation from July 2001 to November 2004. She received a \nfavorable trustworthiness determination in July 2001. \n \nApplicant completed high school and attended a community college from \nSeptember 1977 to May 1979, but she did not receive a degree (GX 5 at 1-2). She was \nmarried in April 2004. This appears to have been a second marriage, but the record \ncontains little information about her first marriage. She and her second husband \nseparated in February 2008, and they intend to obtain a divorce (GX 7 at 34). She has \ntwo children, a 28-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son (GX 5 at 5). \n \nWhen Applicant submitted her SF 85P in March 2007, she answered \u201cyes\u201d to \nquestion 22a, asking, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you . . . filed for bankruptcy, been \ndeclared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had legal judgment rendered against \nyou for a debt?\u201d She disclosed a lawsuit to collect a debt in January 2007. She \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 22b, asking, \u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any \nloan or financial obligation?\u201d Applicant\u2019s credit report dated March 30, 2007, reflected \nthe 21 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, including an unsecured personal loan and \ntwo delinquent car loans that resulted in repossessions in September 2006 and August \n2001. Seventeen delinquent debts had been referred for collection more than two years \nbefore she submitted her SF 85P. \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on November 14, 2007, she stated she \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 22b because she misunderstood the question (GX 7 at 8). \nShe gave the same explanation in her response to the FORM. In her answer to the \nSOR, she claimed she thought the question applied only to loans. \n \n\n3 \n \nIn a previous SF 85P executed in August 2004, she had answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestions 22a and 22b. Her credit report dated October 8, 2004, reflected a $406 debt \nreported to the credit bureau in December 2001 and assigned for collection; an \ninstallment account debt of $393 assigned for collection on which the last activity was in \nNovember 2001; a $1,334 medical bill assigned for collection on which the last activity \nwas in September 2002; a $99 medical bill reported in January 2002 and assigned for \ncollection; $386 medical bill assigned for collection on which the last activity was in \nJanuary 2000; an $80 medical bill reported in November 2001 and assigned for \ncollection; a $10,764 debt reported in January 2004 and assigned for collection; and a \n$54 debt reported in September 2001 and assigned for collection. \n \nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts totaling about $37,721. The two largest \ndebts ($15,750 and $12,302) are the result of deficiencies after Applicant defaulted on \nher car loans and the cars were repossessed. One is for an unsecured personal loan \n($182). Five delinquent debts totaling $1,719 are for telephone service. There are ten \ndelinquent medical bills totaling $3,099. Of the ten delinquent medical bills, five are for \nless than $100.  \n \nIn a statement to a security investigator in January 2005, Applicant explained that \nthe terms of her first divorce decree required her ex-husband to pay the delinquent \nmedical bills, but she became liable for them when he did not pay them (GX 13 at 1). \nShe also told the investigator she had received consumer credit counseling (GX 13 at \n2). In her response to the SOR, she stated that she has had three vehicles \nrepossessed: the first because she could not afford the payments, the second because \nof a divorce (with no further details provided), and the third because she trusted her \nhusband to pay all the bills and he neglected to make the car payments. In a statement \nto a security investigator in May 2007, she attributed about $400 of the delinquent \ntelephone service debt to collect calls from her daughter (GX 8 at 4).  \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant retained a lawyer to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition. In response to DOHA interrogatories on November 14, 2007, she stated all her \ndelinquent debts will be included in the bankruptcy, but she did not include a bankruptcy \nschedule of creditors in her response to the interrogatories. She received the pre-\nbankruptcy credit counseling required by the court in October 2007 (GX at 11). As of the \ndate of her response to the FORM (September 23, 2008), she had paid the lawyer \n$1,800 of the $2,000 fee. The bankruptcy petition will not be filed until she pays the rest \nof the lawyer\u2019s fee.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is about $1,655, plus $600 from Social Security \nand child support. Her monthly household expenses are about $1,541 and monthly \npayments on current debts are about $1,885. Her husband had been contributing about \n$1,454 to the household income, but he has stopped contributing now that they are \nseparated and intend to be divorced. When her husband was contributing to the family \nincome, they had a net monthly remainder of about $283 available to pay their \ndelinquent debts. Without her husband\u2019s contribution, she has a net monthly shortfall of \nabout $1,171. \n \n\n4 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are entitled to adjudication under \nto the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will be \nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). An unfavorable trustworthiness \ndetermination is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines for a favorable \ndetermination. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n5 \n \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nFour disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a trustworthiness \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is raised where there is \nAindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any \nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the \ndebt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-standing delinquent debts, established by her admissions and \ncorroborated by her credit reports, raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). While there is no direct \nevidence of \u201cfrivolous\u201d spending, Applicant\u2019s history of purchasing more than she can \nafford is sufficient to establish the \u201cirresponsible spending\u201d under AG \u00b6 19(b) and the \n\u201cconsistent spending\u201d beyond her means under AG \u00b6 19(e). \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c) and 19(e), the burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nAn applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nTrustworthiness concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by \nshowing that Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, and not the product \nof unusual circumstances that are not likely to recur. They raise doubt about her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nthat Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established.  \n\n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history reflects medical bills that were beyond her control. \nHer ex-husband\u2019s failure to pay the medical bills in accordance with the divorce decree \nalso was beyond her control. The medical bills, however, are a relatively small part of \nher financial picture, many of them for less than $100. She has not explained why \nseveral small medical bills for less than $100 have not been settled even though some \nof them have been outstanding for many years. Her neglect of these bills was not \nresponsible. \n \nApplicant is now facing another divorce, apparently beyond her control. She \nattributed one of the car repossessions to a divorce, but offered no details about the \neffect of the divorce on her ability to pay the car loan. On the other hand, she admitted \nthat at least one of her three car repossessions was the result of purchasing a car she \ncould not afford. Applicant has several delinquent telephone bills and has not explained \nhow and why they became delinquent, except to explain that one delinquent bill was \nincurred when she accepted collect calls worth more than $400 from her adult daughter. \nI conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established, because Applicant has not acted responsibly \nin the face of her limited financial resources. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nthat Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant has received the pre-bankruptcy counseling required by the court, and she \ntold a security investigator in January 2005 she had received consumer credit \ncounseling. This mitigating condition is not fully established, however, because her \nfinancial situation is not under control. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nthat Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nApplicant has done virtually nothing to repay her creditors. Her debts will be legally \nunenforceable if she receives a Chapter 7 discharge, thus reducing her vulnerability to \neconomic pressure. As of the date of her response to the FORM, she had not \naccumulated sufficient funds to fully pay the bankruptcy attorney\u2019s fee. In light of her \nnegative cash flow, it is impossible to predict accurately when, if ever, the bankruptcy \npetition will be filed. Applicant receives some credit for seeking legal advice and \nadopting a plan to resolve her debts, but the actions leading to her delinquent debts and \nlongstanding failure to resolve her debts raise doubts about her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 01-26675 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. \n13, 2003). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified her SF 85P in August 2004 by answering \n\u201cno\u201d to question 22b (debts on loans or other financial obligations over 180 days \ndelinquent) and not disclosing the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.n \n\n7 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also alleges she falsified her SF 85P in March 2007 by answering \u201cno\u201d to \nthe same question and not disclosing the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.t (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as \nfollows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nThe same \u201cspecial interest\u201d regarding the security clearance process also applies to the \nprocess for making trustworthiness determinations. The relevant disqualifying condition \nin this case is set out in AG \u00b6 16(a) as follows: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing her numerous debts on either of her \ntwo SF 85P questionnaires is that she did not understand the question. She claimed \nshe thought the question only applied to loans, even though it asks about \u201cany loan or \nfinancial obligation.\u201d She did not explain why she did not disclose the unsecured \npersonal loan. She admitted three car repossessions, but did not explain why the \ndefaulted car loans were not disclosed even if the question applied only to loans. She \nhas education beyond high school. Her handwritten statement to a security investigator, \nresponse to the SOR, and responses to interrogatories were articulate and generally \nresponsive. She has worked in clerical and administrative positions for defense \ncontractors since July 2001. Under all the circumstances, I find her explanation for not \ndisclosing her delinquent debts implausible. Because she did not request a hearing, I \nhave limited ability to assess her credibility. I conclude the security concern in AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is raised. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns raised by false or misleading answers on an \napplication for a public trust position may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant made no effort to correct \n\n8 \n \nher August 2004 application, and she repeated the same negative answer to question \n22b in her March 2007 application, even though she had been questioned by security \ninvestigators about her delinquent debts in January 2005. She did not disclose the \ndelinquent debts omitted from her second SF 85P until she was interviewed by a \nsecurity investigator in May 2007. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns raised by personal conduct can be mitigated by \nshowing \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s \nfalsifications were not minor, they were repeated in her most recent application, they did \nnot happen under unique circumstances, and they cast doubt on her reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a sensitive \nposition must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed in my discussions of Guidelines F and E, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature woman who has occupied a public trust position since July \n2001. She has longstanding delinquent debts, but she has never adopted a disciplined \nplan to take control of her spending. Whether she will be able to accumulate the funds \nto pay her lawyer to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition is not clear. Whether she will \nchange her spending habits if she receives a Chapter 7 discharge is even less clear. \nHer lack of candor on her SF 85P raises questions about her reliability and \ntrustworthiness. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial \n\n9 \n \nconsiderations and personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant her eligibility \nfor assignment to a public trust position. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for access to \nsensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Daniel Lynch, Attorney At Law\nSeptember 24, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on October 19, 2005.  On February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on April 21, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on July 2, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 8, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for August 1, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\ntwo exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2.  The Applicant called two\nwitnesses, and he testified on his own behalf.  He also presented three exhibits,\nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\n\n2\non August 12, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nconcerning the current political condition in India.  The request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 46 years of age and has a Masters Degree\nin Mechanical Engineering.  He is employed as a Mechanical Engineer for a defense\ncontractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the\ndefense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Bombay, India in 1961 to Indian parents.  He grew up\nthere for twenty-two years prior to coming to the United States.  In August 1984, he\nentered the United States on a student visa and attended a University from September\n1984 through 1986, where he graduated and obtained his Masters degree.

The Applicant enters India\nusing his United States passport and his Indian visa.  (Tr. p. 115).  \nThe Applicant indicates that his goal is to live and retire in the United States.\nSince 2004, he has gradually been moving money from India into the United States.  He\nrecently transferred $500,000.00 from India to the United States.  He plans to, little by\nlittle, move his money to the United States, but only if it makes financial sense, meaning\nthat it must be advantageous for him to do so.  He believes that at this time the Indian\nmarkets are stronger so it is a better financial decision at this time.  (Tr. p. 128).    \nTwo witnesses, one who has known the Applicant almost twenty years, and the\nother who has known him three years, and both of whom have worked with the\nApplicant in the Aerospace Industry, testified that he is very honest, trustworthy and\nresponsible. They believe that he is a very loyal and conservative United States citizen\nand they highly recommend him for a security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 39-64).     \nSeveral letters of recommendation from professional colleagues, including\nsupervisors and/or co-workers of the Applicant attest to his impeccable honesty and\nintegrity.  He is said to be meticulous, law abiding, stable, intelligent, responsible and\nsecurity worthy.  He is highly respected among his peers as one of the most capable\nEngineers in the company.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).    \n\n4\nThe Applicant received a special recognition award in October 2006, for his\nvaluable contribution to the company.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in India.\nAccording to its constitution, India is a sovereign, socialist, secular democratic republic.\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, the Indian government generally respects the\nrights of its citizens, but numerous serious problems remain.  Police and security forces\nhave engaged in extrajudical killings of persons in custody, torture, and rape, and a lack\nof accountability permeated the government and security forces throughout the country,\ncreating an atmosphere of impunity.  Custodial deaths, often made to appear as\nencounter deaths, remained a serious problem, and authorities often delayed\nprosecutions.  Authorities often use torture during interrogations to extort money and\nsummary punishment, and police and jailers typically assaulted new prisoners or\nthreatened violence in exchange for money, favors, and personal articles.  \nAlthough the United States has sought to strengthen its relationship with India,\nthere are some differences between the United States and India, including differences\nover India\u2019s nuclear weapons programs and the pace of India\u2019s efforts at economic\nreforms.  During 2007, Members of Congress have expressed concerns at India\u2019s\nrelations with Iran, a country with which India, launched a bilateral strategic partnership,\nincluding concerns about India\u2019s increasing cooperation with the Iranian military.  Most\nrecently in March 2008, the owner of an international electronics business pleaded\nguilty to conspiracy to illegally export controlled technology to government entities in\nIndia that participate in the development of ballistics missiles, space launch missiles,\nand fighter jets.  Furthermore, there have been other cases involving the illegal export,\nor attempted illegal export of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to India.  Foreign\ngovernment entities, including intelligence organizations and security services, have\ncapitalized on private-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive\nU.S. technology by foreign private entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments\nor its use in military applications.\nThere is also evidence that India is a close ally of the United States, in particular\nin the areas of defense, the War on Terror, and in development and exchange of dense-\nrelated and other technology.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).  \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n\n5\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \n7.  (d) sharing living quarters with a person or person, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure or coercion;\n7.  (e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country,\nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual\nto heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\n\n6\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign connections may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the\nApplicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to\nthat of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nThe Applicant is a naturalized United States citizen.  However, he has significant\nfamily ties in India, that include his mother, father, brother, sister, mother-in law and\nfather in-law who are citizens and residents of India.  There is strong evidence of a\nclose bond and affection with his family in India.  He contacts them by telephone and e-\nmail, and sends them pictures from time to time.  The Applicant\u2019s wife is also very close\nto her parents in India, as evidenced by the fact that the Applicant recently sent them as\nmuch as $10,000.00 to provide financial support.  These close relationships with foreign\ncontacts pose a heightened security risk.  \nIn addition, the Applicant has substantial business holdings and financial\ninvestments in India that he continues to protect.  The value of his holdings in India far\noutweigh the value of his assets in the United States.  This could subject the Applicant\nto a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation and ultimately compromise the\nnational secrets.  It does not go unrecognized that the Applicant has worked hard to\nestablish himself as a responsible, educated, American citizen.  However, he has not\ncut his ties from India.  In fact, most of his financial decisions are strategically based on\nthe Indian markets.  \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 7(d) sharing living\nquarters with a person or person, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion,\nand 7(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in\nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to\nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable. \nIt is noted that the current political situation in India elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  Although there is no direct evidence that his family members in\nIndia are associated in any way with the Indian government, there is evidence of a close\nbond and strong evidence of affection with his family in India.  This bond and affection\nwith his family could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  His substantial financial\ninvestments in India vastly outweigh his assets in the United States and could pose a\nsecurity risk.  Therefore, the possibility of foreign influence exists that could create the\npotential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  I find that the\nApplicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant\nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\n\n8\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.d.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.e.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.f.:  Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.h.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.i.:  Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.j.:  Against the Applicant\n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Cohen, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn June 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines B,\nforeign influence, and E, personal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 30, 2008, admitting the allegations and\nrequesting a hearing. The case was originally assigned to another administrative judge\non October 8, 2008, and scheduled for October 29, 2008. On October 16, 2008,\nApplicant retained counsel who filed a motion for continuance and change of venue.\nThe originally-assigned administrative judge granted the motion, and the case was\ntransferred to me on October 22, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October\nJanuary 26, 2009\n\nThese source documents were part of a larger group of documents that counsel had marked as exhibits A\n1\nthrough Y before the hearing.\nThe italicized text is the language Department Counsel sought to add to the allegation.\n2\n2\n30, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 15, 2008. During the\nhearing, I received two government exhibits, 11 Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of\ntwo Applicant witnesses. DOHA received the transcript on December 23, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the record evidence, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the facts set\nforth in 13 source documents marked and identified as government\u2019s exhibits (GE) I\nthrough XIII. I took administrative notice of the facts set forth in GE I through VIII, and\ndid not take administrative notice of the facts set forth in  GE IX through XIII\nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the facts set\nforth in 13 documents marked and identified as Exhibits C through K, and O through R.1\nI took administrative notice of the facts set forth in Exhibits E through K, O, and P. I\ndeclined to take administrative notice of the facts contained in Exhibits C, D, Q and R. \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to revise subparagraph 1.e and\nadd a new subparagraph, 2.b, as follows:\n1.e. You traveled to Israel in September of 2005, September 2006, July of 2007,\nJune of 2008, and December 2008;  and\n2\n2.b. You falsified material facts on security clearance applications submitted by\nyou in about 1984 and in January 1992 when, in response to questions concerning your\npast use of illegal drugs, namely, marijuana, you answered, \u201cno,\u201d whereas in truth, you\nhad previously used marijuana in high school, and in 1994.\nApplicant\u2019s counsel did not object to the proposed amendment of SOR subparagraph\n1.e, and opposed the proposed addition of SOR subparagraph 2.b. I granted the motion\nin part, amending subparagraph 1.e, as Department Counsel proposed, and adding\nsubparagraph 2.b, as proposed, except for the phrase \u201cin about 1984\u201d, and \u201cand in\n1994.\u201d\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old married man with one adult child whom he adopted\nabout 20 years ago. He has approximately a year of college credits earned taking\ninformation technology-oriented courses. For the past 15 years, he has worked for a\n\nThe grandchildren are Applicant\u2019s nieces and nephews as described later in the Decision.\n3\n3\ndefense contractor as a network administrator (Tr. 155). His duties include customer\nsupport and the maintenance of network operating systems.\nApplicant has a vast knowledge of applications and \u201csets the standard\u201d for\nbusiness network management throughout the entire branch of the armed services that\nhe serves (Exhibit S). According to a senior-level supervisor, he is one of the highest\ncomplimented employees on staff (Tr. 143-144).\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel. She lives in Israel, and\nis 83 years old. She supports herself through his deceased father\u2019s life insurance policy.\nApplicant provides no additional financial support. She was born in the U.S., and\nemigrated to Israel in 1994 to be closer to her grandchildren  (Tr. 170). He talks to his\n3\nmother approximately two times per month (Tr. 215).\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen of U.S. and Israel. She lives in Israel with her\nhusband. She works part-time as a dress maker (Tr. 163). She was born and raised in\nthe U.S., and attended college in Israel from 1982 to 1985. She returned to the U.S.\nafter graduating, married an American, and emigrated to Israel in 1989 for religious\nreasons. Applicant talks with her approximately three times per month and shares an\noccasional e-mail (Tr. 215). \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law, his sister\u2019s husband, is a dual U.S./Israeli citizen. He is\nunemployed, and supports his family through his father\u2019s inheritance. Applicant talks\nwith him \u201con the rare occasion when he happens to answer the phone\u201d (Tr. 210).\nApplicant\u2019s sister has five children, two boys and three girls, ranging in age from\n15 to 22. The boys, ages 17 and 22, have serious mental illnesses, do not work, and\nlive in a residential treatment facility (Tr. 211). Their disabilities prohibited them from\nbeing eligible for the Israeli draft. Applicant talks with them if they happen to be at his\nsister\u2019s house when he calls (Tr. 212).\nApplicant\u2019s oldest niece is 21 years old. She is an Israeli citizen and resident. He\nis unsure if she is currently working (Tr. 213). In December 2008, she got married.\nApplicant traveled to Israel to attend the wedding. She has visited Applicant in the U.S.\napproximately three to four times over the past four years, most recently in August 2008\n(Tr. 214). \nApplicant\u2019s next oldest niece is 19. She is an Israeli citizen and resident. She\nworks as a beautician (Tr. 168). She got married in June 2008, and Applicant traveled to\nIsrael to attend the wedding (Tr. 215). She visited him in the U.S. in August 2008 (Tr.\n215). Both nieces stayed with Applicant and his wife during their U.S. visit. Other than a\ncongratulatory call after he was informed of her wedding plans, Applicant has only\ntalked to his niece by phone when he calls for his sister and his niece happens to\nanswer the phone.\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s youngest niece is 15 years old. He periodically talks to her when he\ncalls his sister.\nIn addition to the trips to Israel in 2008, Applicant has traveled there to visit his\nfamily in September 2005, September 2006, and July 2007. He stays at his mother\u2019s\nhome during his visits (Tr. 171). Each trip lasted 10 to 14 days (Exhibit 2 at 4). He has\nno bank accounts or other property interests in Israel (Tr. 175). \nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy with strong historic and cultural ties with the\nU.S. (Exhibit I at 2). Commitment to Israel\u2019s security has been a cornerstone of U.S.\nMiddle East policy since Israel\u2019s inception (Id. at 10). The U.S. is strongly committed to\nIsrael\u2019s viability as a Jewish state (Exhibit E at 7). Both countries have a mutual interest\nin a peaceful, secure Middle East. The threat of terrorist attacks in Israel is ongoing, and\nis particularly acute in regions controlled by Hamas (Exhibit 4 at 2; Exhibit II at 4). The\nU.S. government warns that American interests could be the focus of such attacks\n(Exhibit IV). Approximately 2.3 million tourists visit Israel each year (Exhibit O).\nUnder Israeli law, criminal suspects are innocent until proven guilty, have the\nright to habeas corpus, to remain silent, to be represented by an attorney, to contact\nfamily members, and to have a fair trial (Exhibit III at 3). The judicial system has an\noversight mechanism to investigate suspected abuses (Id.). There have been some\ncases of individuals prosecuted and convicted of spying against the U.S. for Israel\n(Exhibit VI at 33).\nApplicant completed a security clearance application on September 22, 2004. He\nanswered \u201cno\u201d in response to \u201cQuestion 27\u2013Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\n- Illegal Use of Drugs   Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, which ever is shorter,\nhave you illegally used a controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack\ncocaine, hashish, narcotics . . . , amphetamines . . . , depressants, or prescription\ndrugs?\u201d This was not accurate. He smoked marijuana once with friends at a gathering in\n2002 (Tr. 171).\nIn August 2006, Applicant met with a security clearance investigator from the\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The subject of illegal drug use did not\narise (Exhibit 2 at 3). Applicant met with another agent on May 21, 2007 (Id. at 5). When\nasked, he told the agent that he had never used drugs (Id.). Four days later, he\ncontacted the investigator, admitted the 2002 marijuana use, and told him it was the\nonly time he ever had used it  (Id. at 6).  At the hearing, he testified to using marijuana\nduring high school in the 1970s, and once in 1994 while playing golf (Tr. 186). \nApplicant testified that he falsified the security clearance application because a\nfacility security officer had told him years earlier never to admit illegal drug use on a\nsecurity clearance application (Tr. 182). Over the years, he did not disclose it on\nsuccessive security clearance applications in order to keep his responses \u201cconsistent\u201d\n(Tr. 182). He disclosed it to the investigator who met with him in May 2007, because he\nwas \u201csick of lying\u201d (Tr. 178).\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nan individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests\u201d (AG \u00b6\n6). Applicant\u2019s family members residing in Israel raise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(a),\n\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s status as a staunch U.S. ally, and the only stable democracy in a region\ndominated by authoritarian governments and terrorist organizations does not eliminate\nthe risk of coercion generated by the past episodes of espionage. It does, however,\npose less of a risk than that posed by hostile, totalitarian countries seeking to\n\nThe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\n4\nbeing confronted with the facts.\n6\nundermine the interests and security of the U.S. worldwide through any means\nnecessary. Absent these negative characteristics, I conclude the presence of\nApplicant\u2019s relatives in Israel creates a risk of coercion, but not a heightened risk of\ncoercion. AG \u00b6 7(a) does not apply.\nIn reaching this conclusion, I considered the risk of terrorism prevalent in Israel. \nTerrorism is indiscriminate by nature. Consequently, anyone in Israel including the 2.8\nmillion people who visit annually is at risk of being victimized by terrorism.\nConversely, the possibility that terrorism may be employed against specific\nindividuals, such as the family member of a security clearance holder, is higher in\ncountries that openly espouse it, are hostile to the U.S., or are controlled partially by\nterrorist organizations. None of these characteristics apply to Israel. Although Gaza and\nthe West Bank are either controlled or influenced by terrorist organizations, Applicant\nhas no family living in these areas. Consequently, the risk of terrorism in Israel is an\nongoing challenge to its viability, but is not a factor that heightens the risk of coercion in\nthis specific case.\nApplicant\u2019s Israeli relatives do not generate a foreign influence security concern. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s admitted security clearance application falsification\ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nI have considered the relevant mitigating condition, AG \u00b6 17(a),  and conclude it\n4\ndoes not apply. Applicant intentionally omitted his past drug use from his security\nclearance application in 2004, and denied ever having used marijuana during a meeting\nwith an investigator approximately two and a half years later. This interview was the\nsecond interview he had undergone during the investigative process. When he\neventually disclosed it, he falsely added that it was a one-time occurrence.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\n\n7\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant is a talented worker who is highly respected by his client and his\nemployer. These attributes are insufficient to overcome the security risk generated by\nhis intentional failure to disclose marijuana use, as required, on his security clearance\napplication.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 9, 2008,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 25, 2008,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., granted Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Department Counsel  filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.  Applicant filed a Cross-Appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.28.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision under the Guidelines E, J, and D mitigating conditions is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary\nto law.  Finding error, we reverse.   \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.

He served twenty\nyears in the U.S. military, retiring in 1998.\nIn 2007, he pled guilty to second degree assault in connection with molesting his then\nfourteen-year-old stepdaughter.  The assault occurred in January 2004.  The victim immediately\nrevealed Applicant\u2019s misconduct to her mother, Applicant\u2019s wife.  The wife urged Applicant not to\nturn himself in, due to the financial consequences to the family.  However, in 2006, they separated,\nthough they have not divorced.  During a counseling session with a clergyman, Applicant\u2019s wife\nrevealed the molestation.  Required by law to report the abuse, the clergyman gave Applicant and\nhis wife a brief opportunity to make the report themselves.  However, the clergyman ultimately\nreported the molestation.  During the pre-trial investigation, Applicant was examined by a medical\nexpert qualified to perform psychological testing.  This person concluded that Applicant did not meet\nthe profile of a pedophile, that the offense was a one-time incident, and that he had an \u201cextremely\nlow risk\u201d for recidivism.  Decision at 3.  At the close of the record, Applicant was on probation and\nwas continuing in counseling.  \nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  However, Department\nCounsel\u2019s brief argues that the Judge did not consider or extend appropriate weight to contrary\nrecord evidence.  The Board will consider this argument below.\nB.  Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.31(a).\n1\n  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.31(d). \n2\n \nTr. at 47.  \u201cQ: It\u2019s your understanding that a condition of his probation . . . is that he receive therapy?  A: Yes.\n3\nQ: Upon the completion of his probationary period . . . do you expect to terminate the therapy?  A: That would be\nsomething I couldn\u2019t say for now . . . Q: Have you considered terminating the therapy at this time?  A: No, I have not\nconsidered terminating therapy as of yet.\u201d  This witness testified that, under pressure, Applicant occasionally becomes\n\u201cinappropriately emotional.\u201d  The witness stated that Applicant \u201cfrequently places himself in situations and conditions\nwhere [\u201canxiety and depression\u201d]  become center stage.\u201d  Tr. at 49-50.\n  \n4\nConcerning Guideline J, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s behavior raised a security\nconcern under Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CCDC) 31(a): \u201ca single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses[.]\u201d    This conclusion is sustainable.  However, Department Counsel argues\n1\nthat the Judge erred in not applying CCDC 31(d): \u201cthe individual is currently on parole or\nprobation[.]\u201d   Department Counsel\u2019s argument is persuasive.  Under the facts of this case,\n2\nApplicant\u2019s probation, imposed as a consequence of his plea of guilty, is sufficient to raise this\ndisqualifying condition, and the Judge erred in failing to address it.\nThe principle issue is whether the record will sustain the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\nhad met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  Department Counsel argues that it will not.  The\nBoard notes the nature and circumstances of the offense, plus the following evidentiary matters,\ndrawn from the record and from the Judge\u2019s decision: (1)  that nearly two years elapsed between the\noffense and its discovery; (2) that Applicant did not report the offense himself, despite having been\ngiven an opportunity to do so; (3) that at the close of the record Applicant had been on probation for\nless than two years; (4) that Applicant\u2019s therapist testified that it was premature to terminate\nApplicant\u2019s counseling;  and (5) that  Applicant\u2019s various official statements concerning the incident\n3\nare not consistent with one another.  The Board further notes the Judge\u2019s statement that the judicial\nsystem treated Applicant\u2019s offense \u201cas a relatively minor incident.\u201d  Decision at 4.  The facts\nunderlying the conviction, of course, speak for themselves.  However, a prosecutor\u2019s decision to\naccept a plea agreement does not necessarily suggest that an offense is minor, particularly in cases\nsuch as this one, where a child victim would have to testify against her stepfather.    \nViewed in light of the Egan standard, the record will not support a conclusion that Applicant\nhas demonstrated rehabilitation or that the offense and his subsequent behavior do not \u201ccast doubt\nupon\u201d his \u201creliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement,\u201d especially regarding security concerns\narising from Applicant\u2019s probationary status.  The Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision\nunder Guideline J is not sustainable.  In light of this holding, the Board need not address the issues\nraised by Department Counsel under Guidelines E and D.  Applicant\u2019s cross-appeal contains no\nassertion of harmful error by the Judge.  The Board\u2019s authority is limited to cases in which an\nappealing party has alleged that the Judge committed harmful error.  The Board does not review a\ncase de novo.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-05372 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2008).  \n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: MichaelY.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 9 June 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nE, J, and D.  Applicant answered the SOR 26 June 2008, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 29 July 2008, and I convened a hearing 9 September\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 18 September 2008.\nSeptember 25, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations of paragraph 1; he denied the remaining\nallegations. He is a 50-year-old logistics manager employed by a defense contractor\nsince October 2003. He seeks to retain the security clearance he has held since 1982,\nwhile he was in the military. Applicant served twenty years in the military before retiring\nin 1998. He received multiple military awards and decorations, including six good\nconduct medals.\nIn March 2007, Applicant pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to second\ndegree assault in connection with molesting his then-14-year-old, minor step-daughter\nin January 2004. He was awarded probation before judgment, awarded four years\nsupervised probation, and ordered to have no contact with the victim. His probation runs\nuntil March 2011.\nApplicant testified at the hearing, and I found his testimony credible, both\nregarding the circumstances surrounding the molesting of his step-daughter, and his\nremorse for his conduct. In addition, Applicant\u2019s testimony is corroborated by the\ntestimony of his psychotherapist and the psychiatric examination that was conducted as\npart of the pre-trial investigation of his criminal charges, as well as by the criminal report\nof investigation made contemporaneously with the disclosure of the misconduct (G.E.\n4). Applicant accepted full responsibility for his misconduct, and stated that he could not\noffer an acceptable explanation for his conduct, either to himself or anyone else.\nApplicant molested his minor step-daughter in January 2004. The step-daughter\nrevealed the misconduct immediately to her mother (Applicant\u2019s wife). Applicant and his\nwife and step-daughter had discussions about the course of action to take, including\nhim turning himself in so his step-daughter could get necessary counseling. However,\nApplicant\u2019s wife (and to a certain extent his step-daughter) urged Applicant to not turn\nhimself in because the family\u201412 children between Applicant and his wife from\nprevious marriages\u2014relied on Applicant for financial support. Further, Applicant and his\nwife and step-daughter seem to have been reconciled over his misconduct. Between\nJanuary 2004 and September 2006, Applicant periodically revisited the issue with his\nwife, and each time his wife urged him to put the family\u2019s financial well-being first and\nnot turn himself in.      \nBy September 2006, Applicant and his wife were experiencing marital difficulties,\nand she indicated a desire to separate, which they eventually did. They remain\nseparated, but not divorced, and no divorce proceedings are pending. As a result of\nthese issues, Applicant was in counseling for anxiety and depression, with the\npsychologist who testified at hearing, when the molestation came to light. He remains in\ncounseling with that psychotherapist.\nDuring pastoral counseling with the pastor of their church, Applicant\u2019s wife\nrevealed the molestation to the pastor. This was a reportable incident under both state\nand federal law, but the pastor gave Applicant and his spouse a brief opportunity to\n\n3\nreport the incident directly themselves, although it appears the pastor reported the\nincident before either Applicant or his spouse could act.\nDuring the pre-trial investigation, Applicant\u2019s counsel obtained from the state\nprosecutor a list of acceptable medical experts to perform a psychological examination\nof Applicant for use by the court. The expert chosen by Applicant was frequently used\nby the state to prepare its psychological examinations. In addition to extensive testing,\nthe medical expert consulted with Applicant, his psychotherapist, the step-daughter\u2019s\npsychotherapist, Applicant\u2019s wife, and his five step-children. The expert\u2019s pertinent\nfindings (A.E. A) were that Applicant did not meet the profile of a pedophile, the\nmolestation was a one-time incident, and Applicant was at extremely low risk for\nrecidivism, based on multiple, separate psychometric analyses. Applicant\u2019s current\npsychotherapist concurs with those findings, and would not recommend Applicant for\nhis clearance if he did not think those findings accurately portrayed Applicant.\nBased on the psychological evaluation, the pre-trial agreement was structured to\naccomplish several things. Applicant pleaded to a lesser charge of assault, which did\nnot require him to register as a sex offender. He was awarded probation before\njudgment, conditioned on four years supervised probation, no contact with the victim,\nand continuing counseling for four years\u2014or until determined not necessary. The four\nyears was chosen because Applicant was hopeful of getting his family back together,\nand there was another minor step-daughter who would be 18 years old by the time\nprobation expired. That hope has not been realized, but Applicant\u2019s psychotherapist\ntestified that he would have no concerns with Applicant living with any of his children or\nstep-children, including the victim in this case.\nApplicant has a good work record. His family is aware of his misconduct, as are\nsignificant numbers of his work associates. His church is generally aware of the issue.\nIn addition to the recommendation of his psychotherapist, Applicant has the\nrecommendation of a friend of 10 years, from church, who himself holds a clearance,\nand is aware of the Applicant\u2019s misconduct\u2014having been informed by Applicant during\nthe pending criminal investigation.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommon sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against\nApplicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant\nor denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the\nevidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines E\n(Personal Conduct), J (Criminal Conduct), and D (Sexual Behavior).\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n3\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ; (e) personal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing . . .;\n\u00b6 17.(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\n4\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n4\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against granting\naccess to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s poor judgment in molesting his minor step-daughter.  However,\n3\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. This incident is fairly\nwidely known in his personal and professional communities, alleviating the potential\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Further, without minimizing the\negregiousness or distastefulness of the conduct, the judicial system resolved it as a\nrelatively minor incident. The incident was a one-time event, unlikely to recur, which\noccurred nearly five years ago.  Given the favorable prognoses of both his current\n4\npsychotherapist, and the evaluating psychiatrist, I find that Applicant\u2019s circumstances\nwarrant continuation of his clearance, notwithstanding that his probation does not expire\nuntil March 2011. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\n\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n5\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n\u00b632.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n6\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor judgment; (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, . . . good employment record . . .\n\u00b6 13.(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted;\n7\n\u00b6 13.( b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to\n8\nstop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder;\n\u00b6 13.(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress;\n9\n\u00b6 13.(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\n10\n\u00b6 14.(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances,\n11\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b6 14.\u00a9 the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\n12\n5\nSimilarly, the government established a case for disqualification under Guideline\nJ, but Applicant mitigated the security concerns. His criminal conduct is potentially\ndisqualifying.  However, the record supports application of mitigating conditions to\n5\novercome the security concerns.  The conduct occurred nearly five years ago, was a\n6\none-time event unlikely to recur, the circumstances were unusual, and Applicant has\ndemonstrated extreme remorse for his actions. I resolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nFinally, the government established a case for disqualification under Guideline D,\nbut again, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. The appropriate disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions largely parallel those for criminal conduct. The only applicable\ndisqualifying condition relates to criminal sexual behavior.  However, his misconduct\n7\nwas not compulsive,  is widely known so does not potentially subject him to duress,\n8\n9\nand did not involve public behavior.  Conversely, two mitigating conditions are\n10\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s conduct. The conduct was infrequent, not recent, and under\nunusual circumstances.  The fact that the conduct is fairly widely known among\n11\npersonal and professional connections limits the potential for duress.  I resolve\n12\nGuideline D for Applicant.\nIt would be easy to translate visceral distaste for Applicant\u2019s conduct into denial\nor revocation of his clearance. Such a reaction would be equivalent to a per se denial\nunder the circumstances of this case. However, security clearance determinations are\nnot designed to reward or punish applicants for past conduct that raises security\nconcerns. They are designed to be a clear-eyed assessment of the current risk that a\ngiven applicant might deliberately or inadvertently disclose protected information to\nindividuals not entitled to it. Given the judicial resolution of this case, the favorable\npsychiatric prognoses, and Applicant\u2019s past record of access to protected information\n\n6\nwithout incident, his recent adverse conduct presents little likelihood that he would\nwaver from that record.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on June 12, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems and Guideline E for personal conduct based on falsification of a\nsecurity-clearance application. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided\nfor Applicant. \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 8, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on August 12, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 20,\n2008.\nThe record was left open until August 26, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit additional documentary evidence. No post-hearing matters were received.  \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges seven delinquent debts ranging from $376\nto $19,376 for a total of about $27,600. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that\nApplicant falsified material facts when he answered three questions about his financial\nrecord. He denied the Guideline F allegations and explained that he was working to\nresolve the debts with assistance of a firm\u2019s debt negotiation program. He denied the\nGuideline E allegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts\nare established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He works as a senior\nnetwork administrator. His gross annual salary is about $80,000, although it roughly\ndoubles when he is deployed overseas as has been the case during the last few years\n(Exhibits B and D). He is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nHe is married to his second wife. His first marriage ended in divorce in about\n1995. His wife is employed as a nurse for a local school district.  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. His\nhistory of financial problems is established by a 2007 credit report (Exhibit 3). \nIn March 2008, acting in response to interrogatories that DOHA sent to him,\nApplicant met with and obtained the services of a company with helps individuals get\nout of debt and on a path to financial freedom (Exhibit 2). He entered into a 18-month\n\n See Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony for a narrative description of the debts and their status (Tr. 42\u201361).\n3\n3\nprogram in which the company negotiates a settlement of the outstanding debt (Exhibit\nC). Applicant provided additional funds when he enrolled thereby accelerating the\nprogram. His negotiator estimates that as of July 22, 2008, about 80% of the\noutstanding debt enrolled in the program was settled. \nThe current status of the seven debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the\nfollowing table.3\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$1,447 collection account.\nSettled for $715 in May 2008 (Exhibit C\nat 5).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$1,116 collection account.\nSettled for $541 in June 2008 (Exhibit C\nat 4). \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$1,682 charged-off account.\nSettled for $880 in August 2008 (Exhibit\nC at 3).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$3,162 charged-off account.  \nEnrolled in negotiation program. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013$443 collection account. \nEnrolled in negotiation program. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013$376 collection account.\nAmount too small for program; intends to\naddress on his own. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2013$19,376 charged-off auto\nloan.\nSettled for $8,208 in June 2008 (Exhibit\nC at 2).\nTo sum up, four of the seven debts are settled. The three that remain total about $4,000\nand should be resolved within the next few to several months. \nThe largest debt for $19,376 in SOR \u00b6 1.g is based on an auto loan Applicant\nobtained in about 2002 (Exhibit 3 at 9). Applicant used the vehicle less than a month\nbefore returning it to the seller/financier because he was unhappy with it. He had made\na deposit or down payment for the purchase, but had not yet made a loan payment. The\nseller told Applicant they would keep the down payment and Applicant heard nothing\nmore from the seller. Applicant has since learned that the vehicle was sold at an\nauction. The seller charged-off $19,176 as a loss, the amount apparently based on a\ndeficiency balance after the sale.  \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in January 2007 (Exhibit 1).\nIn doing so, he was required to answer several questions about his financial record. In\nparticular, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the following three questions:\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n8\n4\n\u2022\nQuestion 27 asked about wage garnishments and repossessions in the last\nseven years. He did not report the auto loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g.\n\u2022\nQuestion 28a asked about debts that were more than 180 days delinquent in the\nlast seven years. He did not report the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e, and\n1.g.\n\u2022\nQuestion 28b asked about debts that were currently more than 90 days\ndelinquent. He did not report the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e, and 1.g.\nHe did not report the auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g) as a repossession because he did not\nunderstand that his return of the car to the seller was considered a voluntary\nrepossession (Tr. 62\u201363). He did not report any delinquent debts because he was\nunaware of any that should have been reported in response to the two questions (Tr.\n63\u201366). He thought he was in good standing because he and his wife bought a home\nwith a mortgage loan and his credit history was not an issue. Indeed, a March 2008\ncredit report shows Applicant obtained a mortgage loan for more than $200,000 in\nFebruary 2007 (Exhibit 2). Likewise, it also shows he obtained an auto loan for more\nthan $30,000 in June 2006. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n16\n5\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n6\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n17\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n18\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. Likewise, the evidence is\nsufficient to establish financial irresponsibility.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered, and MC 3 and MC 4 apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nMC 3 applies because Applicant sought out and obtained the services of a\nfinancial company in March 2008 to help him address his indebtedness. He has\nreceived the benefit of their advice and entered into a debt negotiation program, and\nthe indications are that his indebtedness is being resolved ahead of schedule (Exhibit\nC).   \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n19\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n20\n7\n \nMC 4 applies based on Applicant\u2019s documented efforts to resolve the delinquent\ndebts as revealed in the table above. Although he has not resolved all the debts, he has\nresolved the vast majority, and about $4,000 is outstanding. His efforts to date are\nsufficient to qualify as initiating a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n19\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n20\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to Questions 27, 28a,\nand 28b of his security-clearance application, as he did not report any adverse financial\ninformation in response to the questions. Having had the opportunity to listen to his\ntestimony and observe his demeanor, his explanations as set forth in the findings of fact\nare accepted as credible. The evidence is not sufficient to show that he made\ndeliberately false statements when he answered the three questions.  \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain\na favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept\nwas given due consideration and that analysis supports a favorable decision. In\nparticular, I was impressed by the evidence of Applicant\u2019s good character (Tr. 26\u201334;\nExhibits A and B). This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Sunday Obinali Duru, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concern generated by his\nparents, who are both Nigerian citizens and residents. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case \nOn May 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign\ninfluence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 8, 2009, admitting the allegations\nexcept SOR subparagraph 2.b, and requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me\non November 17, 2009. That day, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case\nMarch 18, 2010\n\n2\nfor December 9, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled. During the hearing, I\nreceived three government exhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two\nApplicant witnesses. Also, at the government\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of\nthe facts set forth in seven exhibits marked as government exhibits (GE) 4 through 10.\nDOHA received the transcript on December 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old married man with four pre-teen children. He has been\nmarried for 10 years. A previous marriage ended in divorce in 1999 (AE 4 at 5). Since\n2001, Applicant has worked as a security guard (AE 1 at 3). He has worked with his\ncurrent employer since 2008 (AE E). According to his supervisor, he is a reliable\nemployee who \u201cconsistently performs his duties as an officer with merit and valor\u201d (AE\nE). In 2007, Applicant received a certificate for completing a specialized training course\nfor security officers (AE B). \nApplicant earned a certificate in practical nursing in 2004 (AE C). Currently, he is\nstudying to obtain the requisite licensing to enable him to work as a nurse part time (Tr.\n44).\nApplicant was born and raised in Nigeria He immigrated to the United States\n(U.S.) in 1986 (Tr. 37). In 1991, he earned an associate\u2019s degree in science from a U.S.\nuniversity (AE D). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996 (Tr. 37).\nApplicant\u2019s wife is originally from Nigeria (AE 57). She became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in 2007 (Tr. 40). She is a registered nurse. They own their home, valued at\napproximately $400,000 (Tr. 40). Their net worth is approximately $160,000 (Tr. 40). All\nof their assets are located in the U.S. (Tr. 40, 59).\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Nigeria. They live in a remote\nvillage in the eastern part of the country. His father is 87 years old, and his mother is 75\nyears old. Before retiring, his father owned a grocery store, and his mother was \u201ca petty\ntrader\u201d (Tr. 51). Applicant talks with them twice per week (Tr. 36). Both parents are in\nfragile health (Tr. 52). Periodically, Applicant sends them money, averaging between\ntwo and three thousand dollars yearly, to assist with their health care (Tr. 51). He most\nrecently sent them money in April 2009 (Tr. 52).\nApplicant last visited his parents in the summer of 2008, staying for four weeks\n(Tr. 52). He visited the previous year when his father was sick (Tr. 52). Applicant has\none sibling, a naturalized U.S. citizen and current U.S. resident.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a Nigerian citizen (Tr. 56). She has been living with\nApplicant and his family since 2005, and has a green card (Tr. 56). His father-in-law is\ndeceased.\n\n3\nApplicant is active in the community. He serves on a committee at his church that\ncoordinates charitable activities (Tr. 62). Also, he is active in the local parent teacher\nassociation (Tr. 62).\nNigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states (GE 4 at 1-2). It has a\nbicameral legislature with a senate and a house of representatives (GE 5 at 4). Nigeria\nhas a history replete with military coups, ethnic conflict, and civil war. The emergence of\na democratic Nigeria in 1999 ended 16 years of consecutive military rule (GE 4 at 6).\nSince then, Nigeria\u2019s democratic institutions have progressed; however, they have been\nchallenged by \u201cpoor governance, entrenched corruption, internal conflict, ineffective\nservice delivery, and pervasive poverty\u201d (Id. at 12). Approximately one million Nigerians\nlive, study, and work in the U.S.\nNigeria\u2019s economic team is well-respected in the economic community (Id. at 10).\nNigeria has recently taken many encouraging steps toward fostering a healthy\ninvestment atmosphere. It continues, however, to lack a highly developed infrastructure\neither for transportation or commerce (Id. at 9-10). Rural areas largely do not have\naccess to banks (Id. at 9).\nIn 2007, Nigeria elected a new president, a political moderate who pledged\npublicly to reform the military and promote electoral reform (Id. at 6). Since then, he has\n\u201cretired hundreds of military officers, ordered the release of scores of persons held\nwithout charge . . . [and] moved to recover millions of dollars in funds secreted in\noverseas accounts\u201d (Id.). Also, the president\u2019s new administration has allowed the\nlegislative and judicial branches to operate \u201crelatively free\u201d (Id. at 7). The new\ngovernment has been taking steps to reach out to disaffected communities (AE 5 at 18).\nRespect for human rights has improved markedly under the new administration.\nNigeria is a staunch U.S. ally that lent strong diplomatic support after September\n11, 2001 (GE 4 at 12). It continues to support military action against the Taliban and al-\nQaeda. It has played a leading role in forging an anti-terrorism consensus in Africa (Id.).\nIn November 2007, Nigerian security forces arrested a group of Islamic militants in\nnorthern Nigeria who were alleged to have ties to al-Qaeda (Id. at 21).\nNigeria has played a pivotal role in the promotion of peace in Africa (Id. at 11).\nSix thousand Nigerian peacekeepers are deployed on several United Nations\u2019 missions\nworldwide (Id. at 11).\nIn 2002, Nigeria and Cameroon, a contiguous neighbor, disputed an adjacent\nterritory. Rather than engage in armed conflict, they resolved the dispute through the\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) at the Hague (Id.). After the ICJ awarded most of the\nterritory to Cameroon, the Nigerian president promptly signed an agreement\nimplementing the court\u2019s decision, and removed troops from the area within 60 days\n(Id.).\n\n4\nNigeria has struggled with Islamic extremism, particularly in the majority-Muslim\nnorth (GE 5 at 15). Applicant\u2019s family lives in eastern Nigeria. Some communities have\nadopted sharia, a draconian legal system imposed by fundamentalist Muslims (Id.). In\ntwo cases, local courts, using sharia law, imposed the death penalty against two female\ndefendants accused of adultery (Id.). State courts overturned both judgments on appeal\n(Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These\nguidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nan individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests\u201d (AG \u00b6\n6). The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 7:\n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\n\n5\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\napply; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nAlthough Nigeria is a staunch U.S. ally and an emerging democracy, it is plagued\nby ethnic, religious, and class conflict. Also, its political and economic development is\nhampered by corruption, and the influence of Islamic extremists is growing in parts of\nthe country. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s contact with his parents residing in\nNigeria, and his mother-in-law, a Nigerian citizen with legal U.S. residency status who\nlives with his family, triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d).\nThe potentially applicable mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 8 are as follows:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government, and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\nThere is a presumption that contact with one\u2019s parents is not casual. Moreover,\nApplicant talks with his parents twice per week, visits approximately once per year, and\nprovides financial support. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply.\nThe country\u2019s concern with Islamic extremism is primarily in the north, whereas,\nApplicant\u2019s parents live in the eastern region. Moreover, despite its struggles in\ndeveloping a representative democracy, Nigeria is firmly committed to the U.S.-led War\non Terror, and is a regional leader in promoting anti-terror policy. Also, Nigeria has\nincreasingly demonstrated its commitment to the international rule of law by resolving\ndisputes with other countries peacefully through international tribunals, and sending\npeacekeepers, when requested, to areas of conflict worldwide. \n\n6\nAlthough Nigeria is a U.S. ally, friendly countries may be just as likely to conduct\nespionage against the U.S. as hostile ones. However, it is highly unlikely that Nigeria\nhas an espionage system sophisticated enough to target either its rural inhabitants,\nsuch as Applicant\u2019s parents, or its citizens living abroad, such as Applicant\u2019s mother-in-\nlaw, when it has yet to develop a banking or transportation infrastructure that serves the\nentire country.\nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for nearly 25 years. He received all of his\neducation and training past high school in the U.S., all of his immediate family lives in\nthe U.S., and all of his financial assets are in the U.S. Moreover, Applicant is heavily\ninvolved in his community, volunteering for outreach programs through his church and\nattending PTA meetings. \nUnder these circumstances, I conclude that both AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) apply.\nApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant is an industrious individual focused on excelling on the job, furthering his\nearning potential through education, and raising his children. Upon considering these\nfactors, together with the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I conclude\nApplicant has carried his burden. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 53-year-old married woman who was employed as a linguist by a defense contractor from August 2006 until July 2008, when her employment was terminated pending resolution of her application for a security clearance. She has been a naturalized U. S. citizen since March 2004, and she has possessed a U.S. passport since April 2004. Applicant was born and raised in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina. She resided there with her husband and two children until 1992, when the civil war that raged through their country turned them into refugees literally overnight. At the time the civil war erupted, Applicant was working as the retail manager of a children\u2019s clothing store and her husband was employed as a truck driver and mechanic. Applicant and her husband lost their home and all their possessions as a result of the war, but were able to escape with their two children into Germany where Applicant\u2019s two brothers and one sister had immigrated years earlier. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were killed during the conflict.

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on September 22, 2008.\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations, denied they created a security concern, and\nrequested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nApril 20, 2009\n\n The notice taken of the contents of GE 7-10 was limited to factual matters described therein which\n2\nwould also be contained in public records. (Tr. p. 38)\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on January 6, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued\non January 9, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 13, 2009. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. \nThe government submitted 10 documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-10. GE 1 and 2 were admitted into the record without\nobjection. Administrative notice was taken of the contents of GE 3-10 without objection.2\nDepartment Counsel submitted a document containing written comments on the contents\nof GE 3-10 for my consideration which was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I, and\nmade part of the record without objection. Applicant testified, called her daughter as a\nwitness to testify on her behalf, and submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked\nas Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-5, and admitted into the record without objection. The\ntranscript was received on February 20, 2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 53-year-old married woman who was employed as a linguist by a\ndefense contractor from August 2006 until July 2008, when her employment was\nterminated pending resolution of her application for a security clearance. She has been a\nnaturalized U. S. citizen since March 2004, and she has possessed a U.S. passport since\nApril 2004.\nApplicant was born and raised in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina. She resided\nthere with her husband and two children until 1992, when the civil war that raged through\ntheir country turned them into refugees literally overnight. At the time the civil war erupted,\nApplicant was working as the retail manager of a children\u2019s clothing store and her husband\nwas employed as a truck driver and mechanic. Applicant and her husband lost their home\nand all their possessions as a result of the war, but were able to escape with their two\nchildren into Germany where Applicant\u2019s two brothers and one sister had immigrated years\nearlier. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were killed during the conflict.\nApplicant, her husband and their two children resided in Germany on refugee visas\nfrom approximately October 1992 until they were granted refugee status into the United\nStates in August 1998. Their entry into the U.S. was sponsored by a church-based\norganization that worked to assist persons in predicaments such as Applicant and her\nfamily found themselves. The organization continued to provide assistance to Applicant\u2019s\nfamily after their arrival in the U.S. \nApplicant and her husband, who is now 63 years old, were married in June 1975.\nShortly after immigrating to the United States, Applicant\u2019s husband decided he would be\n\n3\nunable to adjust to life in the U.S. His decision was based partially on language and cultural\ndifferences and partially on a lingering sense of guilt over the death of his parents and his\nhope that he would be able to identify their remains in the event they might be located in\none of the mass graves that were being uncovered in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a result,\nApplicant and her husband agreed to amicably separate with him returning to live by\nhimself in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Applicant continuing to reside in the U.S. with their\nchildren. He returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina in about late 1998. \nApplicant sent her husband about $1,000 annually for a number of years after they\nseparated. She did not intend the money as support for her husband but rather as gifts\nfrom her and their children to recognize special days such as his birthday or father\u2019s day.\nApplicant disavows having any continuing love or affection for her husband and does not\nforesee them ever again living as husband and wife.  \nApplicant obtained an associate\u2019s degree in retail business management and liberal\narts in May 2003, a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work in May 2005, and a master\u2019s degree\nin social work in December 2006. All her degrees were earned in the U.S. state where the\nfamily first immigrated. Her son and daughter also both earned bachelor\u2019s degrees while\nthey resided with Applicant in that state.\nApplicant worked as a health care aide in Germany from March 1993 until April\n1997. She was unemployed from April 1997 until September 2000. In addition to her\nemployment with a defense contractor from August 2006 to July 2008, Applicant has\nworked in the U.S. as a retail sales associate from September 2000 to October 2005; as\nan office assistant from September 2001 to April 2003; as an interpreter from September\n2001 until at least August 2006, when she submitted her security clearance application;\nand again as an interpreter from November 2005 until at least August 2006. As indicated\nby the dates of employment listed in her security clearance application, Applicant\nfrequently worked more than one job at a time. In addition to working, Applicant obtained\nstudent loans to help finance herself and her children while she attended college. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter is now 33 years old, married, has one child who is two years\nold, and was pregnant with her second child at the time of the hearing of this case. After\ngraduating from college, Applicant\u2019s daughter enlisted in the U. S. Air Force in May 2002.\nShe was not a U. S. citizen at the time of her enlistment, and, therefore could not become\na commissioned officer. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2003, and\nobtained a commission in the U.S. Army in 2006. She currently is a first lieutenant,\npossesses a security clearance, and is serving full-time with the Army National Guard. \nApplicant\u2019s son is now 27 years old. He became a naturalized U. S. citizen in March\n2004. He is single and lives in a different state in the U. S. than his mother and sister. He\nis working and pursuing an MBA degree. \nApplicant\u2019s father is 82 years old. He is a citizen and resident of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Applicant\u2019s mother died when Applicant was an infant. Applicant\u2019s father\nworked as a carpenter until his retirement about 12 years ago. He supports himself through\na generous pension and does not receive any support from Applicant. He served in the\nYugoslavian military shortly after the end of World War II, but did not otherwise work for\n\n4\nany foreign government. Applicant speaks with her father by telephone about three times\na year. She does not provide her father with any financial support.\nApplicant has two older brothers and one older sister who are all citizens and\nresidents of Germany. All of her siblings immigrated to Germany in the early 1970s. One\nof Applicant\u2019s brothers is employed as a plumber and the other is employed as a crane\noperator. Applicant\u2019s sister is employed as a home care aide. Applicant speaks by\ntelephone with her brothers approximately once a year and with her sister about two or\nthree times a year. \nApplicant has a half-brother who is married and has two children. He works as a\nsales manager for a car dealer. Applicant\u2019s half-brother is a citizen of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, but he has resided in Serbia since the late 1980s. Applicant has a half-sister\nwho is married, has resided in Croatia since about 1991, and who works in a bakery.\nApplicant has another half-sister who is married, has resided in Germany for about the past\nfive years, and is a homemaker. Lastly, she has a sister-in-law who is a widow with adult\nchildren, who resides in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and who operates a housekeeping\nservice. Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationships with her half-siblings and sister-in-law are\ncasual and minimal. \nThe record evidence is somewhat confusing concerning Applicant\u2019s travels to\nBosnia and Herzegovina. However, it is clear she visited there from June-August 2002,\nJuly-August 2003, and June-August 2004. Some parts of the record would seem to\nindicate all her travels to Bosnia and Herzegovina were side trips taken while she was\nvisiting with her daughter who was stationed in Italy with the Air Force. However, the\nclearest account of the visits is contained in the statement Applicant provided on June 14,\n2007 (GE 2). According to that document, the sole purpose of these trips was to visit with\nher father and husband. She stayed with her father during each of the visits and, according\nto her testimony (Tr. p. 65), her contact with her husband consisted of meeting with him\nand other persons for dinner. \nFrom June-August 2006, Applicant traveled to Croatia, Ukraine, Italy and Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. Her travel to the Ukraine was in the company of a friend who had\nimmigrated from the Ukraine some years before. They stayed with his friends during their\nthree-week visit to the Ukraine. Applicant thereafter spent one day in Croatia visiting with\nher half-sister and four days in Italy visiting with her daughter who was stationed there with\nthe U. S. Air Force. The remainder of the trip was spent visiting and staying with her father\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. She again met her husband for dinner. \nApplicant\u2019s defense contractor employer assigned her to work with the U. S. Army\nin Kosovo from July 2007 to July 2008. She traveled from Kosovo to Italy to again visit with\nher daughter during this time period and stopped in Bosnia and Herzegovina for a few\nhours to visit with her father. Applicant notified her employer before she traveled to Italy\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina and received permission to engage in the travel. Applicant\nhas neither plans nor the intention of visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in the future. \nAlthough Applicant did not possess a security clearance at the time, she was\npermitted occasional access to classified information while working with the Army in\n\n Islamic Terrorism and the Balkans, CRS Report for Congress, July 26, 2005. (GE 6) \n3\n5\nKosovo. There is no indication in the record that she ever mishandled or otherwise risked\nthe compromise of any classified information.     \nThe following information about Bosnia and Herzegovina is relevant to the decision\nin this case:\nAfter the breakup of Communist Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina was\ntorn apart by a civil war between Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Serbs, and\nCroats from 1992 to 1995. The war resulted in the deaths of many thousands\nof persons and the displacement and impoverishment of large parts of the\npopulation. A desperate Bosniak-dominated Bosnian government, facing an\ninternational arms embargo and outgunned by breakaway Bosnian Serbs,\naccepted the help of Iran, as well as several thousand Islamic radicals,\nmercenaries, and others. The 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the\nconflict, required all foreign forces to leave Bosnia. \nMost did, but some Islamic radicals remained behind. . . .\n* * *\nAlthough the terrorist threat in Bosnia appears to have declined in recent\nyears, some observers have asserted that Bosnia poses a more significant\nterrorist risk than often reported. . . . Although presenting the threat in less\ndire terms, U. S. officials acknowledge that the Balkans may serve as a\ntransit point or recuperation area for terrorists.\n* * * \nHowever, it should also be noted that Bosnian opposition to terrorism has\nbeen broad, despite the still-deep ethnic divide in the country. The United\nStates still enjoys a strong reservoir of support in Bosnia, especially among\nBosniaks, for bringing peace to the country and providing post-war aid. . . .\n* * *\nU. S. officials have lauded Bosnia\u2019s efforts in the fight against terrorism. In\nhis 2002 State of the Union Address, President Bush singled out Bosnia\nspecifically for praise for its cooperation with the United States. 3\nAlso:\nDespite increased ethnic polarization and disputes among Bosnian political\nleaders that hindered the functioning of state government for most of the\nyear, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s law enforcement organizations cooperated\nwith the United States on international counterterrorism issues. Bosnia\nremained a weak, decentralized state and ethnically based political\nconfrontations continued to undermine national government. As a result of\n\n Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 2 - - Country Reports: Europe and Eurasia Overview, U. S.\n4\nDepartment of State, April 30, 2008. (GE 4) \n Bosnia and Herzegovina, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, U.S. Department of\n5\nState. (GE 5)\n6\nweak interagency communication, competing security structures, and political\ninterference in law enforcement, Bosnia is vulnerable to exploitation as a\npotential staging ground for terrorist operations in Europe. The dysfunctional\nBosnian state government and efforts by Republika Srpska officials to\nundermine state-level institutions contributed to a slowdown, and in some\ncases, setbacks in efforts to improve operational capabilities to combat\nterrorism and terrorism finance. \n. . . Although Bosnian capabilities and potential for independent action were\ndegraded over the year, Bosnian authorities were generally effective and\nresponsive to U. S. counterterrorism cooperation requests.\n* * *\nBosnia and Herzegovina continued its deployments in support of MNF-I. In\nSeptember, the sixth rotation of the Armed Forces 36-member Explosive\nOrdnance Disposal Unit deployed to Iraq. The Armed Forces also undertook\nspecialized training that would allow for further deployments to either Iraq or\nto support Operation Enduring Freedom.  \n4\nFinally, regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina:\nThe government\u2019s human rights record remained poor. Although there were\nimprovements in some areas, serious problems remained. There were\nreports of increased deaths from landmines, police abuses, poor and\novercrowded prison conditions, increased harassment and intimidation of\njournalists and members of civil society, discrimination and violence against\nwomen and ethnic and religious minorities, discrimination against persons\nwith disabilities and sexual minorities, obstruction of refugee return,\ntrafficking in persons, and limits on employment rights. . . .5\nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n7\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n8\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n9\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n10\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n11\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n12\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n13\n Id at 531.\n14\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n15\n7\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B (foreign influence), with\nits disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n6\n7\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,8\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n9\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n10\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n11\nclearance decision.12\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n13\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n14\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n15\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\n\n8\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Bosnia and Herzegovina. She traveled\nthere to visit with him from June-August 2002, July-August 2003, and June-August 2004.\nWhile on other trips to visit her daughter in Italy, Applicant took side trips to again visit with\nher father in Bosnia and Herzegovina. She maintains telephonic contact with her father by\ncalling him about three times annually. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a): contact with a\nforeign family member . . . or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion applies. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her husband is marital in name only. Shortly after they\narrived in the United States they amicably decided to separate to allow him to return to\nBosnia and Herzegovina while she remained to raise their children in the United States.\nTheir contact was casual at best during her multiple visits to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWhile she initially sent him gifts of money on special occasions after they separated, she\nhas not done so for the past several years. They have now lived separate and apart for\nmore than ten years and her testimony and actions make clear that she has no continuing\naffection for him and that there is virtually no possibility they will ever again live as husband\nand wife. \nApplicant has had minimal contact with her half-brother who is a citizen of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina but a resident of Serbia. Applicant has had almost no contact with her\nsister-in-law who resides in Bosnia and Herzegovina since Applicant fled from there in\n1992. Applicant\u2019s relationship to and contact with her husband, half-brother and sister-in-\nlaw do not create an independent security concern. Whatever slight concern may arise\nfrom those relationships and contacts is completely negated by application of Mitigating\nCondition (MC) 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.  \nApplicant left Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, and she has resided in the United\nStates since 1998. She has been a U.S. citizen since March 2004, and she has possessed\na U.S. passport since April 2004. Her children have both become U.S. citizens, and\nApplicant and her children have resided continuously in the United States since they were\nadmitted as refugees in 1998. They have all earned college degrees in the United States,\nincluding an advanced degree by Applicant. \nApplicant worked continuously, frequently at multiple jobs, since shortly after she\narrived in the U.S. until her employment was terminated pending resolution of the security\nclearance issues alleged in the SOR. Her employment has included service with the U.S.\nArmy in Kosovo where she waw permitted access to classified information without incident.\nWhile serving with the Army, Applicant complied with notice requirements by informing her\nsuperiors of her travels to Italy and Bosnia and Herzegovina and obtaining the needed\npermission to engage in such travel.\n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s daughter is married and, as of the date of the hearing, had one child and\nwas expecting a second. Her daughter has served continuously in the U.S. military since\n2002, including service outside the United States. Her daughter is currently a first\nlieutenant in the full-time Army National Guard and possesses a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s son is working and pursuing an MBA at a university in the United States. \nThe available information about Bosnia and Herzegovina presents a somewhat\ncomplex picture. On the one hand, the country has in recent history been literally torn apart\nby a civil war that left thousands of its citizens dead or displaced. Like many countries in\ntoday\u2019s world, it continues to be affected by terrorist activities and may be serving as a\ntransit point or recuperation area for terrorists. Additionally, it has a poor but, at least in\nsome areas, improving human rights record.\nOn the other hand, U. S. officials have lauded Bosnia\u2019s efforts in the fight against\nterrorism, and, in his 2002 State of the Union Address, President Bush singled out Bosnia\nspecifically for praise for its cooperation with the United States. Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s\nlaw enforcement organizations have cooperated with the United States on international\ncounterterrorism issues. Additionally, Bosnia and Herzegovina continued its deployments\nin support of MNF-I, and its armed forces have undertaken specialized training that will\nallow for further deployments to Iraq or to support Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  \nWeighing Applicant\u2019s affection for her father, and considering his age, economic\nindependence, the 17 years that have passed since she fled from Bosnia and Herzegovina\nwithout adverse consequences or events befalling him, the very limited telephonic contact\nthey currently have, and her lack of intent to return to Bosnia and Herzegovina for future\nvisits, against her demonstrated attachment and devotion to the United States and all\navailable information about Bosnia and Herzegovina, I am satisfied that MC 8(a): the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\napplies.\nAdditionally, considering Applicant\u2019s ties to the United States, including her children\nand grandchildren, her work and educational history while in the United States, which has\nincluded service with the U.S. Army in Kosovo and compliance with travel reporting\nprocedures while there, and the extreme sacrifice she has already made to remain in the\nU.S. by agreeing to separate from her husband of 23 years, I am satisfied that MC 8(b):\nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation\nto the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can\nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest applies.   \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis or her acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\n\n10\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, I am convinced Applicant has mitigated the foreign\ninfluence security concern that existed in this case. She has overcome the case against\nher and satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline B is decided for Applicant.\nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked for several months as an employee and three preceding years as a subcontractor employee. He is a stock clerk. He was married from 1974 to 1979, and again from 1984 to 1989, and lived in a common-law relationship with a third woman from about 1994 to 2002. He has no children. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted to all of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, describing 11 delinquent debts totaling $51,367. Those admissions are incorporated in the following findings. Applicant moved to his current state of residence in 2004, in order to reduce his living expenses by moving in with his brother and sister-in-law. He had terminated an eight-year living arrangement with a woman in another state about a year earlier because, contrary to his wishes, she continued incurring debts they could not afford to repay with their combined income.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant had some delinquent debts incurred more than four years ago that he\nwas prevented from repaying by unforeseen medical problems. All these debts were\nfinally discharged in bankruptcy in October 2008. He is now solvent and debt-free.\nBased upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 10, 2007. On May 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 28, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on June 9, 2008, and originally requested a decision without a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. After preliminary discussions with Department Counsel,\nhe changed his mind and requested a hearing. (Tr. at 17-20.) Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on October 27, 2008, and DOHA assigned the case to me on\nOctober 29, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 2, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on January 7, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 11, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were also\nadmitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s and Department Counsel\u2019s joint\nrequest to leave the record open until January 14, 2009, to permit Applicant to obtain\nand submit additional documents concerning his bankruptcy. This evidence was\nsubmitted and admitted as AE D, without objection by Department Counsel, on January\n8, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor several months as an employee and three preceding years as a subcontractor\nemployee.  He is a stock clerk. He was married from 1974 to 1979, and again from 1984\nto 1989, and lived in a common-law relationship with a third woman from about 1994 to\n2002. He has no children. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted to all of the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, describing 11 delinquent debts totaling $51,367. Those\nadmissions are incorporated in the following findings. \nApplicant moved to his current state of residence in 2004, in order to reduce his\nliving expenses by moving in with his brother and sister-in-law. He had terminated an\neight-year living arrangement with a woman in another state about a year earlier\nbecause, contrary to his wishes, she continued incurring debts they could not afford to\nrepay with their combined income. All of the SOR-listed debts date from this period in\nApplicant\u2019s life. Upon their separation, he agreed to assume responsibility for their debts\nbecause she could not afford to repay any of them and he thought that he could. The\ndebts at that time were considerably less, having since increased through the addition\nof interest and collection agency fees. (Tr. at 25-26, 41-42, 75-78.)\nShortly after Applicant moved in with his brother and was starting a job, he was\ndiagnosed with a disabling disease that required him to undergo a hip replacement. He\nhad to apply for state assistance to afford the surgery, which was eventually approved.\nHe has recently recovered fully from this medical condition, but it prevented him from\nworking for about 14 months. Once he found work again, he contacted his creditors,\nand paid a few of his smaller debts. The creditors holding the larger debts were\nunwilling to negotiate an affordable repayment plan, however, so he finally sought\ncounsel from an attorney who recommended that he file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief.\n(Tr at 25-26, 42-45, 57-61.)\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy case was filed in July 2008, and the court ordered all of\nhis dischargeable debts discharged under Chapter 7 in October 2008. (AE A; AE D.)\nApplicant was not certain, and it could not be determined by examination of the credit\nreports submitted into evidence, whether the two debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i\nwere different debts or duplicate listings of the same underlying debt by two collection\nagencies. Just in case they did reflect different debts, both were listed in Schedule F of\nhis bankruptcy filing (AE D), which listed a total of $54,795 of dischargeable, unsecured\ndebt. Comparing this schedule with the SOR showed that all the debts except the one\nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.g, a $79 cell phone bill, were discharged in the bankruptcy. The\nevidence submitted by Department Counsel shows that this $79 debt was reported as\nbeing paid in full to a successor credit agency in May 2007. (Compare GE 4 at 4; GE 5\nat 7; GE 6 at 8, 12; no longer listed on GE 9 -11.) Thus, all Applicant\u2019s of debts have\nbeen finally resolved. \nApplicant submitted letters from two supervisors who have worked with him in his\npresent position over the past several years. They both praised his good character,\nloyalty, and dedication to his work. His testimony during the hearing was forthright and\ncredible. He displayed a thorough knowledge and reasonable approach to his current\nsituation. He lives modestly and has incurred no new debt since moving to live with his\nbrother. He has no outstanding loans and no credit cards. He has established a\nretirement savings program with his monthly surplus earnings now that his outstanding\ndebt has been fully resolved. (AE B; AE C; Tr. at 61-65, 73-75.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government evidence raised two of these\npotentially disqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and\n\u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d There was neither any allegation nor\nproof of frivolous or irresponsible spending on Applicant\u2019s part. Nor was there any\nevidence of gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, tax evasion, or illegal financial practices.\nSimply, Applicant assumed responsibility for the joint debts largely incurred by his\npartner in a long-term relationship that ended because of her continued irresponsible\nfinancial behavior and his decision to no longer condone it. He was willing to satisfy\n\n5\nthose debts, but unable to do so because of a medical situation that he has since\nresolved. This caused him to undergo a period of unemployment, however, during\nwhich the larger debts grew to the point that bankruptcy became his only option. He\navailed himself of that lawful manner to resolve his delinquent indebtedness, and\nincurred no new debts since returning to work in late 2005. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 19(a) no\nlonger applies to Applicant, leaving only potential concern under AG \u00b6 19(c). He is no\nlonger at any risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds, since his income\nmore than meets his regular living expenses, and all of his former debt has been\nlawfully discharged. Only if his history of not meeting financial obligations indicates poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations should\nthat history support present security concerns.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from a\nhistory of unpaid debt. Since Applicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any SOR-listed\ndebt, the four potentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s formerly delinquent debts all arose more than four years ago, as a\nresult of a relationship he terminated in order to get the situation under control. He has\ntaken all possible measures to minimize his regular living expenses and maintain gainful\nemployment to remain self-supporting. His original plan to pay off the debts was\nderailed by an unforeseeable medical condition requiring major surgery and resulting in\n14 months of unemployment. By the time he could resume work and contacted his\ncreditors about repayment arrangements, they were not interested except on terms\nbeyond his possible means. Accordingly, he sought and received resolution of all his\noutstanding debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, discharged in October\n2008. These actions by Applicant establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a), since the debts\narose long ago and under circumstances he terminated to resolve them, reflecting his\ngood judgment and trustworthiness. The debt resolution was delayed, and ultimately\nprevented, by medical circumstances beyond his control, not through any irresponsible\n\n6\nconduct on his part. He acted as responsibly as the circumstances permitted,\nestablishing mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant sought the counsel of an attorney, and followed the advice given that\nfiling for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief was his best option, given his age and financial\ncircumstances. He saved enough money to do so, and his debts were successfully and\nfully resolved through bankruptcy effective October 2008. This establishes mitigation\nand resolves any remaining security concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves formerly delinquent debts for which he accepted responsibility, with\nevery intent to pay them, after terminating the relationship with the woman on whose\nbehalf they were largely incurred. An unforeseen major medical problem prevented him\nfrom earning the money to repay these debts, after he moved in with his brother\u2019s family\nto minimize living expenses so he could do so. He then paid off several of the smaller\ndebts, but was unable to negotiate repayment programs with the creditors to whom he\nowed larger amounts including significant charges for interest and collection fees. He\nsought and followed the advice of an attorney to resolve his situation lawfully through\nbankruptcy. He has incurred no new debt for almost five years, and is living in a frugal\nand solvent manner on his current income. There is little likelihood of recurrence of this\nproblem, based on his past responses to such troubles and his current desire to avoid\nany repeat of them. His bankruptcy discharge has completely alleviated any potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation or duress from his former debt situation. \n\n7\nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness security concerns arising from his former failure to satisfy debts,\nand brief history of not meeting financial obligations. Overall, the record evidence leaves\nno doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For\nall these reasons, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his\nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 12, 2008, after the hearing, the Administrative Judge Marc E.\nCurry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nApplicant\u2019s central argument is that her Chapter 7 bankruptcy action has now been\ndischarged and she is now debt free except for car and furniture payments.  The proffer of her\ndischarge in bankruptcy constitutes new evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The bankruptcy action was ongoing at the time of the hearing, and the Judge\nacknowledged its pendency in his decision.  However, he concluded that any positive inference that\ncould be derived from the bankruptcy filing was merely speculative considering the fact that the\ndebts had not yet been discharged.  Such a conclusion was not error, and record evidence of a\ncontinuing but incomplete Chapter 7 bankruptcy action does not require a Judge to mitigate security\nconcerns arising out of an applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies.  \nApplicant asserts that her husband\u2019s work-related injuries and the subsequent loss of his\nincome in 2007 resulted in her financial difficulties.  In raising these matters, Applicant essentially\ncontends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did not give\nadequate weight to mitigating evidence.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s\nultimate conclusions are in error.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge made a sustainable finding that several of Applicant\u2019s debt\ndelinquencies predated her husband\u2019s injuries and disability.  In light of this, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were not primarily a result of circumstances\nbeyond her control.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence presented by Applicant in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old, married woman with two daughters, ages 30 and 16. Since May 2008, she has been estranged from her husband (Tr. 20). She has a GED. For the past 10 years, she has worked for a defense contractor that manufactures night vision goggles (Tr. 38). In the last five years, Applicant accrued eight delinquent debts in the approximate amount of $32,000. They include the deficiencies from two repossessed cars (SOR subparagraphs 1.a, and 1.e), two delinquent credit cards (SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c), and delinquencies owed to a jewelry store (SOR subparagraph 1.d), a cell phone company (SOR subparagraph 1.f), a department store (SOR subparagraph 1.g), and a medical services provider (SOR subparagraph 1.h). Applicant also owes the IRS approximately $5,000 of delinquent income taxes from either tax year 1996 or 1997 (Tr. 21). This was not alleged in the SOR. Applicant and her husband earned $164,000 in gross income in 2006 (Exhibit 6 at 7). In October 2007, her husband was seriously injured in a car accident rendering him unable to work (Tr. 17). Their joint, gross income for 2007 decreased to $140,000 (Id.). SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g were delinquent before her husband\u2019s car accident (Answer).

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer, requesting a hearing, on May 15, 2008. I\nreceived the case assignment on June 26, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJuly 24, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 12, 2008. During the\nhearing, I received six government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony.\nSeptember 12, 2008\n\nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition is unclear regarding the amount of delinquencies that she is seeking to be\n1\ndischarged. Schedule F lists $16,242. However, the schedule includes several creditors that Applicant and\nher attorney have identified, but have not ascertained the respective amount of the delinquencies.\n2\nI received the transcript on August 25, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old, married woman with two daughters, ages 30 and 16.\nSince May 2008, she has been estranged from her husband (Tr. 20). She has a GED.\nFor the past 10 years, she has worked for a defense contractor that manufactures night\nvision goggles (Tr. 38).\nIn the last five years, Applicant accrued eight delinquent debts in the approximate\namount of $32,000. They include the deficiencies from two repossessed cars (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a, and 1.e), two delinquent credit cards (SOR subparagraphs 1.b and\n1.c), and delinquencies owed to a jewelry store (SOR subparagraph 1.d), a cell phone\ncompany (SOR subparagraph 1.f), a department store (SOR subparagraph 1.g), and a\nmedical services provider (SOR subparagraph 1.h). \nApplicant also owes the IRS approximately $5,000 of delinquent income taxes\nfrom either tax year 1996 or 1997 (Tr. 21). This was not alleged in the SOR.\nApplicant and her husband earned $164,000 in gross income in 2006 (Exhibit 6\nat 7). In October 2007, her husband was seriously injured in a car accident rendering\nhim unable to work (Tr. 17). Their joint, gross income for 2007 decreased to $140,000\n(Id.). SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g were delinquent before her husband\u2019s\ncar accident (Answer).\nBy March 2008, Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses exceeded her income by\napproximately $630 (Exhibit 6 at 40). She then filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection\n(Exhibit 6).  All of the SOR delinquencies except subparagraphs 1.e and 1.h are\n1\nscheduled to be discharged through the bankruptcy (Exhibit 6 at 25). Applicant\ncontends that she has satisfied the judgment listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e. She\nprovided no supporting documentation (Tr. 30). Since approximately April 2008, she has\nbeen paying SOR subparagraph 1.h through a garnishment (Exhibit 5).\nUnder the bankruptcy plan, the trustee will sell Applicant\u2019s house, use the capital\ngain to satisfy some of the delinquencies, and discharge the remainder (Tr. 38).\nCurrently, the house is on the market (Tr. 36). \nApplicant previously filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1995 (Tr. 35).\nShe \u201ccannot control [herself] with credit cards\u201d (Tr. 35). She has received one hour of\nfinancial counseling, by phone, as part of the bankruptcy filing process (Tr. 39).\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d 19( c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nThe ongoing nature of Applicant\u2019s financial problems renders AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d inapplicable. Several of\nApplicant\u2019s debts were delinquent before her husband was disabled. In the two years\n\n4\nbefore his accident, their income ranged between $140,000 and $164,000 per year. AG\n\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d does not apply.\nApplicant\u2019s participation in financial counseling, and her Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nfiling trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), the person has received counseling for the\nproblem . . .,\u201d and 20(d), the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or other wise resolve debts.\u201d Her financial counseling, however, was limited to\none, one-hour phone consultation. Also, Applicant\u2019s delinquencies have not yet been\ndischarged. Consequently, any positive inference that could be derived from the\nbankruptcy filing is merely speculative.\nApplicant contention that she has satisfied SOR subparagraph 1.e has little\nprobative value absent any supporting evidence. Although she is paying SOR\nsubparagraph 1.h through a garnishment; this does little to demonstrate financial\nstability.\nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI have considered the whole person factors in the financial considerations section\nof the Decision, above. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance\nmust be denied \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n5\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).

On March 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 27, 2009, in which he\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on May 1, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on May 8, 2009, and he submitted a timely reply.  The case was assigned to the\n\n2\nundersigned for resolution on June 16, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 36 years old and married.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s of Science\nDegree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior\nSystems Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations that raise questions about his ability to protect classified\ninformation.   \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  In 1996, while employed as a police officer, and working undercover as a\ndetective in a multi-jurisdictional narcotics task force, the Applicant took part in a raid of\na \u201cmeth\u201d house, where methamphetamine was being produced.  While searching the\nhouse, the Applicant found a large amount of money and a softball size amount of\nmethamphetamine wrapped in aluminum foil and turned it over to the proper authorities.\nThe Applicant was then approached by two other officers in his unit who suggested that\nthey collect a \u201ctrophy\u201d from the raid.  (A trophy is an item of personal property of minor\nvalue from a raid, taken as a keepsake of the bust).  The Applicant improperly took\nsome items of personal property from the meth house.  As a result of this misconduct,\nhe became the subject of a police corruption investigation conducted by the FBI.\nApplicant pled guilty to a misdemeanor offense of 18 USC Section 242, for deprivation\nof civil rights.  He received a four month home confinement along with three years\nprobation.  \nApplicant successfully completed the sentencing requirements imposed by the\ncourt, and voluntarily resigned from the police department.  Applicant\u2019s probation officer\nsuggested that, in his opinion, because of the Applicant\u2019s character and actions the\nApplicant would be a good candidate for a Presidential Pardon.  After contacting an\nattorney regarding the matter, Applicant decided not to pursue it when he learned that it\ncould cost between $7,000.00 and $10,000.00 to do so.    \nApplicant explained that although his misconduct is not excused, when the\nincident occurred, he had been working as a full time police officer for eight months.  He\n\n3\nwas 24 years old, young, and from a small town police department.  He wanted to fit in\nwith the task force, and as a junior member just went along with what he was told.\nApplicant stated, \u201cMy time in the unit can be summarized by a state of constant fear.\nHere I was a 24 year old Officer who had joined the Police force to help others, but now\nam in a state of constant fear and distrust from those that I immediately work with and in\nfear for my life from those I was trying to work cases on.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the\nFORM, attachment 1).  Applicant was naive and did not have the maturity level required\nto do the job properly.          \nThe Applicant indicates that since then, thirteen years has passed and he has\nmatured and changed his life around for the better.  He has learned from his mistakes of\nthe past.  He returned to school, obtained his Bachelor\u2019s of Science in Electrical\nEngineering degree, embraced his religion by volunteering at his church, and has\nbecome a different person than he was before.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM,\nattachment 1).\nAmong many church related volunteer services the Applicant has been involved\nin being a role model for a family with three children with an absentee father.  He has\ntaught one of the children to play baseball, attends their sporting events and provides\ngeneral support.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, attachment 1).  \nNumerous letters of recommendation from friends, coworkers and professional\ncolleagues who have known the Applicant for many years and/or see him on a daily\nbasis indicate that the Applicant is an honest, conscientious, compassionate,\nhardworking, dependable and reliable individual.  He demonstrates good judgment and\nhigh ethical and moral standards in all aspects of his life.  He is loyal, highly patriotic\nand a man of honor and integrity.  His technical expertise at work is a true asset to the\norganization.  He is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Response\nto the FORM, attachment 2).\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent guidelines.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n\n4\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of\nsignificant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources;\n16.(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that\ncountry or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States may service as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other\ngroup.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n17.(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n17.(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n17.(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs\nunder circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n\n5\na. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The extent to which participation was voluntary\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\n\n6\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's personal conduct has a direct and negative\nimpact on his suitability for access to classified information.  \nThe evidence shows that thirteen years ago, the Applicant was placed in a\nspecial position of trust, that of an undercover police officer, and he intentionally violated\nthe position by engaging in corrupt activities.  There is absolutely no excuse for his\nmisconduct of the past. His actions were investigated by the FBI and he was formally\ncharged, convicted and sentenced for deprivation of civil rights.  The Applicant states\nthat he is not the same person that he was thirteen years ago.  Since then, he has\ngreatly mature and changed his life around.  He has finished college, joined the church,\nrealizes right from wrong and has corrected his mistakes of his past.  He is a person of\nhonesty, integrity and trustworthiness and he is not intimidated by anyone. He has had\nno further encounters with law enforcement.  He is extremely remorseful for his\nmisconduct of the past.  He states that he has learned a harsh lesson from this\nexperience and understands that the serious ramifications of any misconduct and that\nthe Government will not tolerate any dishonesty while holding a security clearance. \n    \nUnder Guideline E, Disqualifying Conditions 16.(d) credible adverse information\nthat is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself\nfor an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation.

Roberts, Esquire\nSeptember 15, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 28,\n2006. On April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline G for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on May 1, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 16, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on August 19, 2008, in Reno, Nevada. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 12, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on her own behalf and had four other witnesses testify for her. She\nsubmitted Exhibits A through S, which wee also admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on September 3, 2008.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations 1.a., through 1.i.,\nunder Guideline G. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nadditional witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 36 years old. She is unmarried and has two children. She received a\nBachelor of Arts Degree in education in 1995.\nApplicant is employed as a Human Resource representative/general by a\ndefense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her\nemployment in the defense sector.\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she\nhas engaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations as\nthey are cited in the SOR, and to which, as stated above, Applicant admitted:\n1.a.  The SOR alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times to excess\nand to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1988 to at least October 2007.\n1.b. In 1992, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Failure to Drive within\na Single Traffic Lane, (2) Driving without an operators license, and (3) Driving While\nIntoxicated (DWI), first offense. She plead guilty to counts (1) and (2), and she was\nsentenced to serve two years probation. On this occasion she made the poor choice to\ngo out of her dorm and drive in her vehicle, after she has been consuming alcohol. \n1.c. In 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault on an Officer.\nApplicant had consumed alcohol prior to the incident. Applicant testified that this\nincident occurred when a friend got into an altercation with a police officer in a parking\nlot. When the officer attempted to hold her friend, Applicant  came to her aid and\n\u201cshoved\u201d the officer.  \n1.d. In 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Exceeding the Speed\nLimit, and (2) Driving a Motor Vehicle While Intoxicated (DWI), second offense. She\nplead guilty to excessive Blood Alcohol Content (BAC)-Prior Offense. Applicant was\nsentenced to four months incarceration, suspended, two years supervised probation,\ncommunity service, and shock detention for 15 days. \n1.e. In June 1995, Applicant received alcohol related counseling from a court\nordered service.\n\n3\n1.f. In 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with Destruction or Injury to\nProperty. Applicant plead guilty and she was sentenced to 30 days, suspended on the\ncondition that she pay restitution. Applicant had consumed alcohol prior to this incident.\nApplicant testified that on this incident she was intoxicated, and as she was walking she\nbecame physically cold. She struck the window of a bank building, because she wanted\nto warm up in the building. She entered the building and passed out, and that is where\nthe police found her.  \n1.g. In 1997, Applicant received out-patient alcohol abuse counseling from an\nabuse center. Applicant testified that this consisted of meeting a counselor two times a\nweek for two or four weeks. She entered this counseling at her own discretion, because\nshe was concerned about her alcohol history. \n1.h.  In February 2004, Applicant was evaluated at an alcohol therapy center.\nApplicant received the diagnostic impressions of prior alcohol abuse by record of arrest\nand reported history. Applicant testified that this evaluation was done as part of the\nprocess of applying for a security clearance. \n1.i. On July 11, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Speeding, (2)\nDisobedience to Stop Signs, and (3) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).  She\nplead guilty to Count (3), and she was fined, assigned to attend DUI school, and\nordered to perform community service.  \nApplicant testified that all of the alcohol related incidents, with the exception of\nthe DUI in 2006, which is 1.i., above, occurred when she was a college student and\nliving away from her hometown.  After Applicant graduated college, and when her\ndaughter was born  in 1998, she returned to live in the same town that she has since\nshe was in the second grade, with her mother, father, aunt and now her two children.\nShe testified that after her daughter was born, she knew she had to make some\nchanges in her life and become more responsible. \nAfter 1998, Applicant had no more alcohol related incidence until her DUI arrest\nin 2006. She testified that this incident occurred after she had attended a company\nfunction, at which all the other witnesses, who testified at the hearing, also attended.\nAfter the company function ended, she stayed on the premises to socialize with non\nbusiness friends. She estimated that she was at the sight from approximately 6:30 P.M.\nto 10:30 or 11:30 P.M. She estimated that she had eight drinks over the approximate\nfour hour period. When she left she planned to drive home, thinking she did not have\ntoo far to go. \nAfter the 2006 DUI arrest, Applicant estimated that she stopped drinking alcohol\nfor four or five months, but then she began consuming alcohol again, although by her\nestimate it was minimally. A few months prior to the hearing, Applicant made the\ndecision to abstain completely from alcohol. She testified credibly that \u201calcohol is no\nlonger a part of my life since five months ago.\u201d She still attends dinners and social\nevents, and she has found it is not something that she has to have.  She also works\nwith youth in her town, and she feel that she can set a better example if she abstains\ncompletely.\n\n4\nExhibit E consists of a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Evaluation, dated\nAugust 18, 2008, by the same psychologist who performed the evaluation in 2004, that\nis discussed in 1.h., above. The doctor\u2019s diagnosis of Applicant is Alcohol Abuse-in\nRemission. He further states that Applicant \u201cis motivated to prevent further\ncomplications resulting from alcohol consumption . . . She says she has now stopped\ndrinking alcohol entirely. I believe further intervention is not necessary at this time,\nhowever it would be advisable for her to carefully self-monitor her actions and consult\nwith a treatment professional if she strays at all from her plan.\u201d \nAs stated above, four witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The first witness\nto testify on Applicant\u2019s behalf was the current Facility Security Officer (FSO) for the\ncompany that employs Applicant. They have known each other since 2000, and since\n2005 they have worked together. They also socialize together. The witness testified that\nApplicant works as her assistant and she has great confidence in her ability, and has\nnever seen Applicant do anything to question that confidence. She also verified that\nApplicant told her that her intention was to abstain from all alcohol consumption in the\nfuture, and since then she has not seen Applicant consume any alcohol. \nThe second witness was the west coast director for Applicant\u2019s employer. He has\nknown her since 2000.  He testified that he has absolute trust in Applicant, and he\nwould not have been as successful if it were not for her. He testified that he has never\nwitnessed any problem for Applicant at work because of alcohol consumption.\nThe third witness is the wife of the second witness. She has known the Applicant\nas a friend. She described Applicant as a very responsible parent and person in\ngeneral.  She stated that Applicant was a great person and a good friend. \nThe fourth and final witness is a retired Marine Major General, who is now a vice\npresident for Applicant\u2019s employer. He has known Applicant since 2005, when he hired\nher. He testified that he \u201ctrusts her implicitly, her judgement and her integrity. I\u2019ve never\nhad any problem with her in any shape or fashion, but certainly never a security\ninvolvement.\u201d He also testified that he has never known her to drink to excess, and in\nhis last few visits with Applicant, he did not see her consuming any alcohol. Finally, he\nstated that in the last few years Applicant has \u201cdemonstrated on a daily basis her\nhonesty, her integrity, her loyalty, and certainly her judgement,\u201d and he believed that the\n2006 DUI was a \u201cone time occurrence.\u201d\nIn additional to the four witnesses who testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, she\nsubmitted 11 letters of recommendation (Exhibits G through Q). Four of the letters were\nfrom the witnesses who testified, and basically they reiterated their support for her.\nHowever, the other seven letters included individuals who have known Applicant as an\nacquaintance for many years. They all describe her in extremely positive terms as a\n\u201cconsiderate, reliable and trustworthy person,\u201d with \u201cgood character.\u201d\nApplicant was part of a group that started a scholarship program to give $500 to\nyoung women who play softball to help them with their education. Exhibit R includes\nletters from two young women, thanking Applicant after they received these\nscholarships. \n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes disqualifying conditions (DC) that could raise a security\nconcern. Because of Applicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol use, including three arrests\nfor DWI or DUI and her additional alcohol related incidents, the following DC apply to\nthis case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents\nof concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as\nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides mitigating conditions (MC) that also apply to this case:\n(b) the individual acknowledges her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse,\nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a\npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\nApplicant does acknowledge her previous serious alcohol problems from 1992 to\n1997. She seemed to resolve her alcohol issues and had no further alcohol incidents\nuntil 2006. The 2006 DUI is a concern, because it is recent and it shows poor\njudgement.  Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption was minimal after her 2006 DUI arrest,\nand she has testified credibly that her intention for the last few months and the future is\nto abstain completely from alcohol consumption. Based on her own credible and sincere\ntestimony, the very positive testimony of the other four witnesses, and the letters of\nrecommendation, I conclude that Applicant has overcome her alcohol problems and will\nbe able to abstain from alcohol in the future.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n7\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the factors\ndiscussed above, including but not limited to: Applicant\u2019s maturity and expressed\nremorse at her previous alcohol related incidents, her current abstinence, and the\nextremely positive character testimony about Applicant from very impressive witnesses,\nI find that Applicant has  greatly improved her situation regarding alcohol consumption,\nand she is a responsible person, who will continue to control her alcohol issues.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1f.:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor  Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 13, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 6, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge David M. White\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were\nbased upon substantial record evidence; whether the Judge did not consider all the record evidence;\nwhether the Judge erred in his weighing of the evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nfailed to satisfy the requirements of the Directive; and whether the Judge erred in failing to conclude\nthat Applicant had mitigated the security concerns in his case.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a technician employed\nby a Defense contractor.  He served in the Army for nine years.  After leaving the Army he worked\nin the Middle East, where he met his wife, who was born and raised in Russia.  They married in the\nmid-1990s and Applicant\u2019 wife became a U.S. citizen in the mid-2000s.  They have one son, born\nin the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s father-in-law works for a Russian state university.  His mother-in-law retired\nfrom teaching science seventeen years ago and has been a homemaker ever since.  Applicant speaks\nno Russian and has had limited direct contact with his in-laws, having seen them during visits to\nRussia or during their visits to the U.S.  His wife speaks to her parents \u201cby telephone several times\nper month.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Recently, Applicant and his wife invested one-half of the $100,000\npurchase price of some property in southern Russia.  The purpose was to develop a hotel or bed and\nbreakfast to be operated by his in-laws upon the retirement of his father-in-law.  Applicant and his\nwife earn $60,500 and $51,000 respectively.  They own two pieces of real estate in the U.S. of a total\nvalue of $601,900.  Applicant\u2019s character references describe him as honest, reliable, and hard-\nworking.  Applicant also submitted favorable character evidence concerning his father-in-law,\nprovided by those with personal knowledge of him.\n\n3\n\u201cRussia has an active, recent, and ongoing intelligence collection program targeting the U.S.\u201d\nId. at 4.  Along with China it is the most aggressive collector of sensitive and protected U.S.\ntechnology.  It is a leader in industrial espionage against the U.S.  \u201cRussian officials reportedly\nengage in human rights abuses, including abductions, torture, coerced confessions, and unlawful\nsurveillance of citizens and visitors.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) Applicant contends that the Judge did not consider or did\nnot properly weigh evidence which he submitted in mitigation, such as the strength of his ties to the\nU.S., his service to the U.S. in combat zones, and evidence concerning the nature of his relationship\nwith his in-laws.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he\nspecifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR\nCase No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  He is not required to discuss each and every piece\nof record evidence in making a decision.  See ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007).\nFurthermore, a party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).   We have considered Applicant\u2019s\nappeal brief in light of the Judge\u2019s decision and the record evidence.  We find no basis to conclude\nthat the Judge did not consider the entire record or that he weighed the evidence in an arbitrary or\ncapricious manner.\nApplicant takes exception to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was potentially vulnerable\nto pressure or influence because of the circumstances of his in-laws.  Applicant argues that the\nJudge\u2019s analysis seems to equate his relationship with his in-laws to his wife\u2019s relationship with her\nparents.  He insists that he deserves the right to have his own record and relationship examined, and\nhe states that the concept that his relationship with his wife\u2019s parents is as close as hers simply\nbecause he is close to his wife is deeply flawed and denies him due process rights.  Applicant asserts\nthat his relationship with his wife\u2019s parents is inherently different from his wife\u2019s relationship with\nher parents.  Applicant\u2019s arguments on this point are not persuasive. \nThere is nothing in the Judge\u2019s decision indicating that he equates Applicant\u2019s relationship\nwith his wife\u2019s parents with his wife\u2019s relationship with them.  Rather, the Judge gave appropriate\nrecognition to the fact that, through his loving relationship with his wife, Applicant has a legitimate,\nserious interest in the welfare of her parents who are citizens and residents of Russia.  The Board has\nrecognized that, as a matter of common sense and human experience, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members\nof the person\u2019s spouse.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (Feb. 20, 2002).  A review of the\nrecord evidence convinces the Board that the presumption has not been overcome in this case.\nAccordingly, the Judge did not err in considering the immediate family members of Applicant\u2019s\nspouse as raising unmitigated security concerns.      \n\n4\nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements of\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  The Judge\u2019s decision noted Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence as to character, as\nwell as evidence concerning the good character of his wife and in-laws.  However, he balanced that\nagainst evidence that Applicant\u2019s foreign in-laws and property holdings are in Russia, which has a\nproblematic human rights record and which conducts espionage against the U.S.  The Board\nconcludes that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances in reaching his\ndecision.  See ISCR Case No. 05-03948 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 21, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-09959\nat 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  In support of his appeal, Applicant has referred the Board to\nnumerous other industrial security cases, both from the Hearing Office and the Board.  He contends\nthat these other applicants were granted clearances under factual circumstances similar to his own.\nWe give due consideration to them.  However, each case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.3.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The Board will  reverse a Judge\u2019s\ndecision only if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  As stated above, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that, through his wife, Applicant\nhas close ties to his Russian in-laws is consistent with the record evidence.  The Judge\u2019s further\nconclusion that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from this relationship\nis also consistent with the record evidence.  See  ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)\n(There is a rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are\nadverse to the United States and the risk that the applicant might fail to protect and safeguard\nclassified information). On this record, the Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable.\nDecision at 9.  See also Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security\u2019\u201d). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 2 and 3), are incorporated in the following findings. Applicant is a 43-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor. He has worked for his present employer for almost three years. He served in the Army for just under nine years, and took early separation as part of a draw-down program in 1994. His two other jobs since leaving the Army have also been with defense contractors providing maintenance support for military equipment. He has never held a final security clearance. He briefly held an interim clearance during the first few months of his first post-service job, but was then promoted to a position that did not require a clearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Roger C. Cartwright, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Russia. His wife owns\ninvestment property in a resort area in southern Russia worth about $100,000, and has\na close relationship with her parents. Foreign influence concerns were not mitigated.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 24, 2006. On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nFebruary 6, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 21, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (AR) on September 3, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 8,\n2008, and the case was assigned to me on that same date. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on October 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 7,\n2008. Without objection, I granted the Government motion to amend the SOR by adding\nan inadvertently omitted paragraph identifying and describing Guideline B. The\nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection.\nThe Government also offered HE II, comprising a request that I take administrative\nnotice of certain facts concerning the Russian Federation and nine Government\ndocuments supporting the veracity of those facts. Applicant had no objection, and\nadministrative notice was taken of these facts. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and\nsubmitted exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest to leave the record open until November 21, 2008, to permit his submission of\nadditional evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 17,\n2008. On November 18, 2008, Applicant submitted AE B, which was forwarded by\nDepartment Counsel without objection on December 2, 2008. It was admitted into\nevidence, and the record closed on that date.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the factual allegations and\ndenied others with explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in\nhis response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 2 and 3), are incorporated in the following\nfindings.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor. He has\nworked for his present employer for almost three years. He served in the Army for just\nunder nine years, and took early separation as part of a draw-down program in 1994.\nHis two other jobs since leaving the Army have also been with defense contractors\nproviding maintenance support for military equipment. He has never held a final security\nclearance. He briefly held an interim clearance during the first few months of his first\npost-service job, but was then promoted to a position that did not require a clearance.\nHe was also granted an interim clearance in connection with his current employment.\n(GE 1; AE A at 16; Tr. at 60-66.)\nApplicant\u2019s first job after leaving the Army was in a Middle Eastern country. He\nhad recently divorced his first wife. After about a year, he met his current wife. She had\nbeen born and raised in Moscow, Russia, and went to the Middle East in 1994 to work\nas a secretary after finishing college with a degree in history. They married in June\n1996. They moved back to the United States in connection with a job change in 1999.\nThey have one son, born in 2003. Applicant\u2019s wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\nFebruary 2005, and renounced her Russian citizenship in the process. She now works\nas a social worker. Both of them testified persuasively concerning their appreciation of,\nand loyalty to the United States. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law worked as the head of the Building Maintenance\nDepartment at a Russian state university from 1984 to January 2005, when he was\npromoted to Chief Engineer for the university. In that capacity, he is responsible for the\nBuilding Maintenance Department, as well as construction and utilization of new\ncampus facilities, ongoing repair and renovation of all buildings and utility systems, and\nfire safety. (AE A at 13.) His mother-in-law retired from her position as a science teacher\nat a Russian college some 17 years ago, and has been a home-maker since then. (GE\n3 at 3; Tr. at 38, 53.)\nApplicant speaks virtually no Russian, and his wife\u2019s parents speak very little\nEnglish, so they communicate through her. He met his father-in-law during two 14-day\nvisits to Russia, in 1997 and 1998, and when his father-in-law visited them in the United\nStates, most recently for 10 days in 2006. He met his mother-in-law when she came to\nthe U.S. for a second wedding ceremony held here in December 1996 at Applicant\u2019s\nmother\u2019s request. He also saw her during the Russia visits, and her four visits to their\nhome in the U.S. since 2000. The most recent of these visits lasted 30 days in\nSeptember 2005. Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with her parents by telephone several times\nper month. She last visited them in Russia during summer 2006. (GE 2 at 8; GE 3 at 3;\nTr. at 36, 39-40, 66-68, 77.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife and her parents decided to buy some undeveloped resort-area\nland in southern Russia near the Black Sea in 2005. They anticipated developing a hotel\nor bed and breakfast on the land at some future time as a place for her parents to\noperate when her father retires. She and her parents each invested half of the\napproximately $100,000 purchase price for the land. Her $50,000 contribution came\nfrom cashing in her 401(k) savings and some of the stock she purchased in the\ncompany that formerly employed her. In order to avoid unfavorable inheritance and tax\nconsequences, the land is titled solely in Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s name. Other than supporting\nhis wife\u2019s decision, Applicant was not actively involved in this transaction, but he and his\nwife live in a community property state. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that development plans\nare not being actively pursued at present due to her mother\u2019s deteriorating health, and\nmay be canceled with the property sold to finance her parents\u2019 retirement. She is her\nparents\u2019 only child. (GE 2 at 9; GE 3 at 3, 6; Tr. at 40-42, 47-50, 69-71, 95-97.)\nApplicant and his wife submitted earning statements showing that his gross\nearnings for 2008 were about $60,500, and hers were about $51,000. They submitted a\nsworn statement estimating the value of their assets in the U.S. as well, subject to\nrecent market fluctuations and reductions. They have a principal residence valued at\n$345,950 and a rental home valued at $255,950, for a total of $601,900 in real estate.\nTheir other retirement, investment, and personal property assets were estimated to total\n$79,000. No information was provided concerning their mortgage balances, any equity\nloans, or other debts against which to calculate their net worth.  (AE B.)\nApplicant submitted letters, certificates, and performance evaluations from his\ncurrent and former employers and co-workers attesting to his excellent work\nperformance, reliability, dedication and integrity. (AE A at 1-4, 6-8, 11-12, 15, 17-21.) He\n\n4\nwas awarded an Army Commendation Medal, two Army Achievement Medals, and two\nGood Conduct Medals during his active duty service, which ended with an Honorable\nDischarge. (AE A at 16, 22-27.) His wife\u2019s supervisor considers her to be an honest and\ncaring person, who is calm, objective, and conscientious about her work. (AE A at 5.)\nThe wife of Applicant\u2019s long-time close friend and former co-worker also speaks\nRussian, and has known Applicant\u2019s father-in-law for more than 13 years. She speaks\nwith him during his visits to the U.S., and found him to be trustworthy, hardworking and\nconsiderate. (AE A at 9; Tr. at 77.) Another Russian-speaking couple who are family\nfriends of Applicant and his wife have met his father-in-law both during his U.S. visits\nand during their visits to Russia. They wrote that he is a nice and modest person, with a\nlow key demeanor and quiet manner. He told them that he is very proud of his daughter\nbecoming a U.S. citizen, and happy that she is living and raising her family in this\ncountry. (AE A at 10; Tr. at 77.)\nI took administrative notice of the facts set forth in HE II concerning the Russian\nFederation. That country is a very large nuclear superpower that has continued to\ndevelop economically, socially and politically since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nRecent events that have escalated tensions between Russia and the U.S. include the\nincursion into internationally recognized sovereign Georgia territory by the Russian\narmy, threats against Poland, suspicious poisonings and killings of journalists and other\npersons considered to be undesirable, and manipulation of energy resources to\npressure NATO allies and other U.S.-friendly countries. Russia has an active, recent,\nand ongoing intelligence collection program targeting the U.S. As of 2005, Russia and\nChina were the most aggressive collectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology\nand accounted for the majority of such targeting. Russia has been a leader in industrial\nespionage against the U.S. since at least 1997, with no indication of abatement. Russia\nalso practices substantial intelligence collection and espionage against the U.S., and\nshares various technologies of security concern with other countries whose interests are\ncontrary to those of the United States. Russian officials reportedly engage in human\nrights abuses, including abductions, torture, coerced confessions, and unlawful\nsurveillance of citizens and visitors. (HE II.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\n\n5\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established\none of them: \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion.\u201d (Tr. at 101.) Although not directly asserted by Department\nCounsel, disqualifying conditions \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or\npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of\nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion;\u201d and \u00b6 7(e), \u201ca substantial\nbusiness, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned\nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation;\u201d were clearly raised by the evidence and discussed by both counsel.\nRussia is a country of significant concern for information security and espionage\nagainst the U.S., so connections there are more likely to generate heightened risk of\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion than most other countries.\nApplicant has a close and loving relationship with his wife, and through her has entirely\nlegitimate, serious interest in the welfare of her parents who are citizens and residents\nof Russia. Their visits to Russia to visit these family members, her parents\u2019 multiple\nvisits to the U.S., and her multiple monthly telephone contacts demonstrate the\nimportance of their family relationship. Applicant\u2019s wife invested $50,000 in a joint\nventure with them to purchase undeveloped resort property in Russia worth $100,000,\nand this property is titled only in her name. Although insufficient evidence was supplied\nto determine what percentage of their net worth this investment represents, it equals\nalmost a full year of gross earnings for both of them. Accordingly I conclude that it\nrepresents a substantial property interest. These facts meet the Government\u2019s burden\nof production by raising all three of the aforementioned disqualifying conditions. These\ncontacts, relationships, and property interest shift a heavy burden to Applicant to prove\nmitigation under applicable Appeal Board precedent. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those with\npotential application in mitigating AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 (a), (c), and (e) security concerns are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation; and\n\n7\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not\nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s relationships with her family in Russia are close and important\nto her, and his relationship with her makes him susceptible to pressure and exploitation.\nIt is not necessary that such pressure or exploitation be shown to have occurred to\nestablish these concerns. Her father holds an important position responsible for all\nbuilding and utility matters at a Russian state university, a government entity. Applicant\ndid not establish that either his fully appropriate family relationships or his in-laws\u2019\nposition and activities in Russia make the risk of exploitation or pressure unlikely. Their\ncontact, particularly with his wife, is frequent and their relationship is close. The direct\nand substantial investment in the resort property, held solely in his wife\u2019s name, and her\nposition as the sole heiress of her parents\u2019 other property, preclude a conclusion that\nsuch property interests could not be used to exert effective influence, pressure, or\nmanipulation.\nGiven the nature of the Russian government and Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ongoing\npresence and property holdings there, the heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion remains a concern. Applicant failed to\nestablish the mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8 (a), (c), or (f), because his\nrelationship with his wife and, through her, to her family is not one that supports a\nconclusion that such risk of exploitation is unlikely. \nOne Guideline B mitigating condition was established to some degree by\nApplicant, but it is framed to provide mitigation for a disqualifying condition that was not\nasserted by the Government. This mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 8(b): \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nThis mitigating condition addresses security concerns under AG\u00b6 7(b), that\nApplicant\u2019s foreign connections could create a potential conflict of interest between his\nobligation to protect information and his desire to help the foreign people or entity by\nproviding the information. Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding loyalty to the U.S. is\nunquestioned. However, this mitigating condition does not squarely address the \u00b6\u00b6 7\n(a), (c), and (e) security concerns arising from heightened risk of foreign pressure,\nmanipulation or exploitation from the contacts, relationships, and property of concern.\nAccordingly, the mitigating effect under this condition is insufficient to overcome those\nsecurity concerns raised by the undisputed facts in this case.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern does not involve any personal misconduct, dishonesty or disloyal activity. While\nother factors including his excellent work record, character and loyalty have been duly\nconsidered, the primary whole-person issue that is of concern under these\ncircumstances is his marriage to a former Russian citizen with Russian citizen/resident\nparents. This raises, \u201c(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\u201d\nand \u201c(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nApplicant has not sufficiently met his burden to mitigate the resultant security\nconcerns. His close family ties, through his wife, to people who currently reside in and\nare citizens of the Russia create an ongoing potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation or duress, and the likelihood of continuation in the medium-term and long-\nterm future is established by the evidence of record. As long as his wife\u2019s family still\nlives there, and she owns the resort property, he may well visit there again and be\npersonally subject to the actions of the Russian government as well. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from foreign influence considerations.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Savarino, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines B (Foreign \nInfluence) and C (Foreign Preference). Eligibility for continued access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 10, 2006. On May \n30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines B and C. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nDecember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 6, 2008; answered it on June 25, 2008; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nJune 30, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 30, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to me on October 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 16, 2008, scheduling the hearing for November 4, 2008. At Applicant\u2019s request, \nthe hearing was postponed until November 13, 2008, and I convened the hearing on \nthat date. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented the testimony of two \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) 1 through 21, which were admitted \nwithout objection1. The record closed on November 4, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 21, 2008. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Lebanon. The request and the documents attached as enclosures were not \nadmitted in evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. I took \nadministrative notice as requested, with no objection by Applicant. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR with \nexplanations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old electrical engineer. He has been the president, chief \noperating officer (CEO), and facility security officer of his own company, a defense \ncontractor, since June 1988 (Tr. 71). He first received a clearance in January 1985, \nwhile employed by a defense contractor and still a citizen of Lebanon (AX 20). His \ncompany has held a facility clearance since May 1989 (AX 2) and has passed every \nsecurity inspection from that date until the date of the hearing (AX 3-13; Tr. 73). \n \n \nApplicant was born in Lebanon in November 1947. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in civil engineering in Lebanon in 1970. He studied in France from 1972 to 1980 \nat a public university affiliated with the ministry of defense, obtaining a master\u2019s degree \nin naval architecture, and doctorates in fluid mechanics and mathematical sciences. He \ncame to the U.S. in 1980, applied for permanent residence in 1982, and became a U.S. \ncitizen in December 1987. In January 1985 he married a native-born U.S. citizen whom \nhe met in 1973, while they were both studying in France.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant went to France to continue his education, he initially intended to \nreturn to Lebanon, but after the civil war in 1975, he decided to look for \u201canother life.\u201d \n                                                     \n1 The usual convention is to letter an applicant\u2019s exhibits. However, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted the \nexhibits with numbered tabs, and I chose to retain his numbering system rather than substitute letters for \nnumbers. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe combination of meeting his U.S.-born wife and a job offer from a defense contractor \nmotivated him to come to the U.S. (Tr. 65). \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is an employee of the U.S. government and holds a top \nsecret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (Tr. 42). She also \ndoes administrative work on weekends for Applicant\u2019s company (Tr. 41). She and \nApplicant both work with classified material in their respective jobs but they never \ndiscuss their work (Tr. 44-45). She testified Applicant\u2019s brother in the U.S. worked for \nApplicant\u2019s company until the late 1990s when they had a falling out, and they are now \nestranged and have no contact (Tr. 47-48, 78). She also testified Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers know he is a scientist but they do not know he does work for the U.S. \ngovernment (Tr. 49). \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse own their home in the U.S., and their equity in the \nhome is about $1.5 million. His total assets in the U.S., including his company, are \nworth about $5 million. He has no assets in Lebanon (Tr. 95).  \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s 16 employees who has had daily contact with him testified \nthat the company has protocols for handling sensitive information and enforces them \n(Tr. 32). He has never seen Applicant treat sensitive information carelessly (Tr. 33). He \nhas heard Applicant mention his Lebanese family in passing, but he knows little about \nthem (Tr. 34-36). \n  \n \nApplicant retained his Lebanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen as a \nprecaution to avoid harassment at roadside checkpoints in Lebanon, but he never found \nit necessary to use it (Tr. 84, 88, 105). When he entered and exited Lebanon, he \nshowed both his U.S. and Lebanese passports, and immigration officials stamped his \nLebanese passport (Tr. 88, 103). In October 2008, he renounced his Lebanese \ncitizenship and surrendered his Lebanese passport to the Embassy of Lebanon (AX 16-\n19). Although the instructions from the Lebanese embassy stated that he should give a \nreason for renouncing his Lebanese citizenship, he declined to do so because he \nbelieved that disclosing the reason (to retain his clearance) would be contrary to the \ninterests of the U.S. (Tr. 91). As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not yet been \nnotified of Lebanon\u2019s decision to accept his renunciations of citizenship (Tr. 120). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, two brothers, and two sisters are citizens and residents of \nLebanon. A third brother is a citizen of Lebanon permanently residing in the U.S. \nApplicant disclosed his family members in Lebanon and his travel to visit them on his \nsecurity clearance applications in 1984, 2004, and 2006 (GX 1; AX 20 and 21). He \ndisclosed his Lebanese passport on his 2004 and 2006 applications. He was unaware \nof the security concerns raised by his passport until he received the SOR. \n \nApplicant is close to his mother and two sisters. His mother is a housewife, and \nhe calls her every two or three weeks. He has been sending his mother about $15,000 a \nyear for the past three or four years (GX 2 at 4; Tr. 55, 82). He sends the money by wire \ntransfer to his mother\u2019s account with a bank in Beirut (Tr. 108, 111). His mother is \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndiabetic and virtually bedridden (Tr. 50, 76). He testified he would continue his financial \nsupport of his mother \u201cas long as there is nothing that forbids [him]\u201d and \u201cif it\u2019s not \nillegal.\u201d He is confident his siblings would assume responsibility for her support and care \nif he were required to stop sending her money (Tr. 81-82, 125). One of his sisters is a \nhousewife whose husband works in a cement factory, and he talks to her once or twice \na month. The other sister is a schoolteacher whose husband is a retired housing \ninspector, and he talks to her about once a month (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 56, 107). Applicant\u2019s \nmother and two sisters live in a small, predominantly Christian town in northern \nLebanon situated about 30 or 40 miles north of the center of terrorist activity in Beirut \n(Tr. 77-78). Applicant has visited his family in Lebanon four times in 30 years, each time \nfor about a week (Tr. 83). The last visit was in July 2004 (GX 1 at 8). \n \nApplicant testified he is not close to his two brothers in Lebanon. He has \ntelephonic contact about twice a year with one brother in Lebanon, an architect; and \ntelephonic contact about once a year with his other brother in Lebanon, a schoolteacher \n(GX 2 at 4-5). His contact with these two brothers is limited to holiday greetings. He has \nno contact with his estranged brother who resides in the U.S. (GX 2 at 5). None of \nApplicant\u2019s family members have any association with the Lebanese government (Tr. \n80). \n \nApplicant frequently attends international scientific conferences as well as \nclassified conferences sponsored by defense agencies. He has authored numerous \nscientific articles, and several of his publications were co-authored by foreign nationals. \nThey include several co-authored by employees of his company who were citizens of \nTaiwan, Korea, Russia, and India permanently residing in the U.S. (Tr. 115-16), and \nothers articles co-authored by professors and students who are citizens of France (Tr. \n116). \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts about Lebanon. \nLebanon is a parliamentary republic that became independent in November 1943. The \nU.S. policy is to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon and to help preserve its \nindependence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity. Since its \nindependence, Lebanon\u2019s national policy has been determined by a small group of \nregional and sectarian leaders. Political institutions often play a secondary role to \nreligion and personality-based politics. Lebanon has been in a state of war with Israel \nsince 1973. Civil war broke out in April 1975 and did not end until 1991. Since 1992, \nLebanon has experienced social and political instability, economic uncertainty, lack of \ninfrastructure, violent clashes with Israeli forces, and political assassinations.   \n \nI also take administrative notice that Lebanon\u2019s foreign policy and internal \npolicies are heavily influenced by Syria, which maintains intelligence agents in Lebanon \nand is a state sponsor of terrorism. The unstable political situation in Lebanon enables \nforeign terrorist organizations to operate within its borders. Hezbollah is the most \nprominent terrorist group in Lebanon, and it has been designated by the U.S. \nDepartment of State as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d The Lebanese government \nrecognizes Hezbollah as a legitimate resistance group and political party. Hezbollah \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmaintains offices in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon, is closely allied with Iran, \nsupports a variety of violent anti-Western groups, and has been involved in numerous \nanti-U.S. terrorist attacks. Hezbollah seeks to obtain U.S. technology, has been involved \nin several efforts to obtain restricted, dual-use technology, and is considered by the U.S. \nto be the most technically capable terrorist group in the world.  \n \n \nFinally, I take administrative notice that Lebanon has a poor human rights record \nand has been ineffective in controlling terrorism and political violence. Lebanese \nsecurity forces have engaged in arbitrary arrest, murder, torture, and other abuses. \nThere is an atmosphere of governmental corruption and lack of transparency. Militias \nand non-Lebanese forces operating outside the area of Lebanese central government \nauthority have used informers and monitored telephones to obtain information about \ntheir perceived adversaries. Ongoing political violence and terrorism directed at \nAmericans and U.S. interests make Lebanon dangerous for U.S. citizens. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother, two brothers, and two sisters are citizens \nand residents of Lebanon (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d), and that one of his brothers is a \ncitizen of Lebanon permanently residing in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The security concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, \na disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise AG \u00b6 7(a) is a relatively low standard. It is \nsatisfied if the risk raised by the citizenship or presence of family members in a foreign \ncountry is greater than it would be if they were not citizens or residents of the foreign \ncountry. Where family ties are involved, the totality of the family ties to a foreign country \nas well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \n \nApplicant has very limited contact with his two brothers in Lebanon. \nNevertheless, there is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family \nmember are not casual, and Applicant has not rebutted that presumption. See ISCR \nCase No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). Applicant\u2019s family ties to Lebanon are \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), shifting the burden to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Nevertheless, the nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the government, an \nadministrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to \ngrant clearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area \nwhere family members resided). \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \n\n \n8 \n \n \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members live in a Christian enclave north of Beirut, away from \nthe center of Hezbollah influence. They have low-profile lives, and they do not know that \nApplicant works on defense-related projects. They have no contact with the scientific or \nhigh-technology community. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s brilliant career and \ninternational reputation make him a high-visibility target for direct or indirect pressure. \nWhile there does not appear to be a high risk of pressure being exerted on Applicant \nthrough his family, the evidence is insufficient to establish that it is unlikely. I conclude \nApplicant has not established AG \u00b6 8(a).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty to the current government of Lebanon appears to be minimal, but his \nloyalty to his family, especially his mother, is far above \u201cminimal.\u201d  \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant has deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S. He has resided in the U.S. for almost 30 years, held a clearance for \n24 years, held U.S. citizenship for 21 years, and has been married to a native-born U.S. \ncitizen for 24 years. His spouse is a government employee with a high-level security \nclearance. Almost all his professional career has been in defense-related work. All his \nconsiderable assets are in the U.S. When he learned his dual citizenship and Lebanese \npassport raised security issues, he promptly renounced his Lebanese citizenship and \nsurrendered his passport. When asked about his financial assistance to his mother, he \nindicated he would terminate it if it were forbidden or illegal. I am convinced Applicant \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is \nestablished. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant held a valid Lebanese passport after becoming a \nU.S. citizen (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. A disqualifying condition \nmay arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a current foreign \npassport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). Applicant\u2019s possession and use \nof a Lebanese passport raises AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), shifting the burden to him to refute, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). Security \nconcerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be mitigated if \u201cthe \npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). Applicant\u2019s written renunciation of his Lebanese \ncitizenship and delivery of that renunciation and his Lebanese passport to the Embassy \nof Lebanon establishes both of these mitigating conditions. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He has dedicated \nmuch of his scientific career to supporting the national defense of the U.S. He left \nLebanon before the civil war and decided to never return. He has lived 38 of his 61 \nyears in the U.S. and has held a clearance since 1985 without incident. Starting with his \nfirst security clearance application in 1984, he has been candid and forthright about his \nconnections to Lebanon, his dual citizenship, and his possession of a Lebanese \npassport. Although previous favorable determinations do not estop the government from \n\n \n10 \n \n \ndenying an application to continue a clearance, Applicant\u2019s history of candor, reliability, \nand trustworthiness while holding a clearance is relevant. His security profile has not \nchanged since he was first granted a clearance, except to the extent that his ties to the \nU.S. have strengthened and he has renounced his Lebanese citizenship and \nsurrendered his passport.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and foreign \npreference. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn November 7, 2005, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application \n(e-QIP). On May 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn June 9, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and declined a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On June 30, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a File \nof Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, and mailed Applicant a complete \ncopy on July 3, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on July 14, 2008, and had 30 days \nfrom its receipt to file objections and submit additional information. On July 29, 2008, \nDOHA received additional information from Applicant. Department Counsel had no \nobjection to the materials. On August 22, 2008, I was assigned the case. I marked \nApplicant\u2019s submission as Exhibit (AE) 1.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 9, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. of the SOR, with explanations.  \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old, unmarried, and was born in Canada in 1983.  Applicant \nattended high school in the United States, graduating in 2001.  She graduated from a \nU.S. college in 2005.   Applicant worked in the United States continuously since 2005, \nand is pursuing a graduate degree.  Applicant did not disclose when she moved to the \nUnited States with her parents.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August \n1998.  She retained her Canadian citizenship.  She obtained her first U.S. passport on \nSeptember 20, 1999.  In October 2005, Applicant began a position, as a software \nengineer, with her current employer, a federal contractor. In November 2005, she \ncompleted an e-QIP.  (Item 4) \n \n           Applicant\u2019s mother and father were born in Hong Kong.  Her mother has dual \nU.S. and Canadian citizenship. Her mother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993.  \nHer father is a Canadian citizen. He is a registered alien living in the United States with \nhis wife and son.  Applicant\u2019s parents live in the United States.   Applicant has a 19-year \nold brother who was born in the United States, and lives in the United States with his \nparents.  (Item 4) \n \n Since receiving her U.S. passport, Applicant has used her Canadian passport.  \nShe traveled outside the United States for pleasure trips in 2001, 2003, and 2004.  She \nstated in her e-QIP that \u201cI have an active passport/citizenship from Canada because I \nwas born there.\u201d  After learning of the Government\u2019s security concerns, Applicant \nrefused to surrender her Canadian passport to her Facility Security Officer. She \nunderstands \u201cthat any further processing of her security clearance will be discontinued.\u201d \n(Items 4 and 5) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 sets forth the security concern involving foreign preference that arises: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case \nestablished one of them: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;  \nApplicant was born in Canada in 1983. She has a Canadian passport that she \nuses for travel.  Applicant stated in writing she refuses to surrender her Canadian \npassport.  Based on the evidence in the record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the \nGovernment produced substantial evidence of disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(1). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those conditions, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the resulting \nsecurity concerns. AG \u00b6 11 provides eleven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns, one of which could have potential application in this case: \n (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \nIn her Answer to the SOR and Response to the FORM, she admitted possessing \nthe Canadian passport.  After becoming aware that her Canadian passport could \npotentially have an adverse effect on her employment, she refused to surrender or \ndestroy it.  Hence, AG \u00b6 11(e) does not apply.  No other mitigating conditions apply. \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential \nconcern under Guideline C resulted from possessing and refusing to surrender her \nCanadian passport.  The Guidelines make no exception for any nation\u2019s passport.  \nApplicant knows the requirement under the Guideline C to surrender the passport to \nobtain a security clearance.  She stated in writing she refused to surrender the passport.  \nTherefore, no mitigating conditions under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept apply. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under foreign \npreference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: Against Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old employee for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant is not married and has no children. He lived with his grandmother for many years (see ex. A). Between 1993 and 2006 Applicant incurred considerable debts which became delinquent. Altogether, he accumulated 29 listed debts that exceed $215,000.00. Applicant\u2019s credit reports corroborate the listed delinquent debts in the SOR (compare exs. 5 through 8). In an OPM interview given in February 2007, Applicant did not dispute any of the listed debts listed in his credit report. He declined to provide any releases for his delinquent accounts, and failed to furnish any explanations for his heavy debt accumulations. Applicant has a net monthly income of $3,356.00. His net monthly household expenses total $2,011.00. One of his creditors currently garnishes his wages for $300.00 a month (see ex. 5). He has a net monthly remainder of $1,045.00 (ex. 5).

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn June 1, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 8, 2008, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on August 21, 2008.  Applicant did not submit any information in\nresponse to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on October 21, 2008.\nNovember 5, 2008\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 29 delinquent debts\nexceeding $215,000.00. These allegations are framed by subparagraphs 1.a\nthrough1.cc.  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations,\nadmitted some of the underlying debts while denying any obligations to the listed\ncollection agency, and denied two of the allegations. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is not married and has no children.  He lived with his grandmother for\nmany years (see ex. A).  Between 1993 and 2006 Applicant incurred considerable debts\nwhich became delinquent.  Altogether, he accumulated 29 listed debts that exceed\n$215,000.00.  Applicant\u2019s credit reports corroborate the listed delinquent debts in the\nSOR (compare exs. 5 through 8).\nIn an OPM interview given in February 2007, Applicant did not dispute any of the\nlisted debts listed in his credit report.  He declined to provide any releases for his\ndelinquent accounts, and failed to furnish any explanations for his heavy debt\naccumulations.\nApplicant has a net monthly income of $3,356.00.  His net monthly household\nexpenses total $2,011.00.  One of his creditors currently garnishes his wages for\n$300.00 a month (see ex. 5).  He has a net monthly remainder of $1,045.00 (ex. 5).\nApplicant traces his financial problems to 1997 when he began paying his\ngrandmother\u2019s medical bills and supplementary living expenses (see ex. 5).  She was\nvery sick for a number of years and passed away in May 2006 (ex. A).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n3\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant traces his financial problems to 1997 when he began assuming major\nresponsibility for covering his grandmother\u2019s medical bills.  Records indicate that he\n\n4\naccumulated over $215,000.00 in listed debts (even more based on his own\nacknowledgments).  Applicant has not provided any creditor releases or documented\nexplanations of the reasons for his significant debt accumulations.  Considering the size\nof his debt arrearage and the absence of any exhibited plausible explanations for the\naccumulations,  these debts raise security significant concerns.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual Applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.   Applicant mis-steps in judgment\nand questions about his reliability and trustworthiness are very much in evidence here\nbased on the compiled administrative record.\n Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his inability to explain them and\nsuccessfully address them warrants the application of two of the disqualifying conditions\n(DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations: DC  \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts\u201d and DC \u00b6 19\u00a9) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  These\ndisqualifying conditions cover the core concern of AG \u00b6 18: poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which, both individually and\ncollectively, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to safely occupy a position of trust.  \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debts are traceable in part to financial set backs\nassociated with his grandmother\u2019s medical bills.  Based on his very limited accounts of\nhis financial difficulties, partial application of MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is warranted\nhere.  \nAt this time, none of Applicant\u2019s covered debts are documented to have been\npaid, disputed, or settled.  They exceed $215,000.00 in the aggregate and represent a\nconsiderable debt load based on his current income sources.  Applicant provides no\nexplanations of the circumstances that gave rise to the debts in issue, and provides no\nevidence of any follow-through in addressing his outstanding debts.\nWithout more documented information to demonstrate Applicant is explaining and\naddressing his significant debt accumulation, he cannot mitigate the Government\u2019s\nfinancial concerns.  Holding a security clearance involves the exercise of important\nfiducial responsibilities, which include the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared for access to classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While a principal\n\n5\nconcern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to\ncoercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are important concerns as well.\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt repayment efforts is insufficient to enable\nhim to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying conditions\ncovered by AG \u00b6 18.  Without any exhibited repayment and work-out efforts to\ndemonstrate progress in resolving his debts, it is not feasible to draw convincing\nconclusions about his overall trustworthiness based on factors not covered in the\nmitigating conditions of the guideline. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance of\na \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d in the management of an applicant\u2019s finances, which\ncertainly includes evidence of actual debt reduction through repayments. See ISCR\nCase No. 05-01920, at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007).  True, an applicant\u2019s good-faith debt\nrepayment does not require that he demonstrate repayment of each and every listed\ndebt.  All that is required is that the applicant demonstrate that he developed a plan to\nresolve his debts and taken significant actions to implement the plan.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 07-16013, at 2 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-09684, at 2 (App. Bd.\nJuly 6, 2006). \nApplicant fails to meet Appeal Board requirements for repayment progress with\nhis listed creditors.  Absent some tangible form of payments and/or repayment plans on\nhis listed debts, safe predictive judgments about his finances cannot be made at this\ntime.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nunsatisfied debts and overall presentation of payment histories, Applicant does not\nmitigate security concerns related to his heavy debt accumulations.  Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a\nthrough1.cc.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT   \nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.cc:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  Clearance is denied.\n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n                                        \n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on June 12, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The SOR\nalleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct and Guideline E for\npersonal conduct based on falsification of a security-clearance application. For the\nreasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nOctober 8, 2008\n\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n3\nherein. \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR is dated July 7, 2008, and she elected a decision\nwithout a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on the written record in\nlieu of a hearing. \nOn August 15, 2008, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant on August 18, 2008, and it was\n3\nreceived by her on September 10, 2008. She replied to the FORM within the allowed\n30-day period, and her reply consists of a one-page letter, which is admitted as Exhibit\nA. The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer, Applicant admits the SOR allegations. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for\nher current employer since 2003. Her current position or job title is geo-spatial\ntechnician. \nIt appears Applicant is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the\nfirst time. She completed a security-clearance application on or about November 29,\n2006 (Exhibits 4 and 5). She was required to answer various questions about her\nbackground, to include her police record. She denied having ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any felony offense in response to Question 23a. Likewise, she denied\nhaving ever been charged with or convicted of any drug- or alcohol-related offenses in\nresponse to Question 23d. Indeed, she replied in the negative to all questions about her\npolice record, thereby denying any police record.  \nThe record evidence shows Applicant was involved in two incidents of criminal\nconduct.

Second, on or about November 17, 2006,\nApplicant was arrested and charged with disorderly intoxication. She was subsequently\nconvicted of disorderly conduct and sentenced to a fine and court costs.\nIn her reply letter to the FORM (Exhibit A), Applicant states the following: 1) that\nshe has no desire to jeopardize her country; 2) that she likes her job and desires a\nclearance so that she may continue working and learning; and 3) that she is looking for\na chance to better herself.\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n5\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n7\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n16\n4\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n15\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n16\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n17\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n18\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n19\n DC 3 is the \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n20\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n5\nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to Questions 23a and\n23d of her security-clearance application. In making this determination, I note that I\nhave not had the opportunity to listen to her testimony and observe her demeanor. She\nappears to contend that she did not knowingly and willfully make false statements. In an\ninterview, she explained that she did not report the 2006 alcohol-related offense\nbecause it was not yet adjudicated (Exhibit 7). In response to interrogatories, she\nexplained that she did not report the 1983 drug-related offenses because she applied\nfor a pardon in 1990 and assumed she obtained it (Exhibit 6). \nApplicant\u2019s contentions and explanations are not credible. First, her pardon\ncontention is not supported by the record evidence, as she failed to submit any reliable\nevidence showing that she sought a pardon. Second, it is simply too difficult to accept\nas true that a person of Applicant\u2019s age and maturity could honestly believe that she did\nnot have to report a police record consisting of both drug- and alcohol-related offenses,\nthe most recent of which took place about two weeks before she submitted the security-\nclearance application. The record evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant\nmisunderstood the questions, genuinely thought the information did not need to be\nreported, or made an honest mistake. Indeed, her explanations are merely after-the-fact\nrationalizations. \nAll of the MC under Guideline E have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Making false statements to the federal government during the\nsecurity-clearance process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily explained away,\nextenuated, or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n17\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n18\nIn general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct.\nIn particular, DC 1  and DC 3  apply against Applicant as evidenced by her 1983 drug-\n19\n20\nrelated offenses (which resulted in her imprisonment) and her 2006 alcohol-related\noffense. Applicant\u2019s involvement in these two incidents of criminal conduct calls into\nquestion her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n\n6\nThe guideline also contains several conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. All the MC have been considered and none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. Any\nevidence of reform and rehabilitation is undermined by Applicant\u2019s conduct in 2006\nwhen she made deliberately false statements on her security-clearance application.\nAccordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. \nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion\nto obtain a favorable clearance decision.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Lynn Swenson, Personal Representative\nDecember 8, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on June 14, 2007.  On May 29 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines J and E for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 3, 2008.  He answered the\nSOR in writing on June 13, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request on June 17, 2008, and it was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on July 9, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 16,\n2008.  The case was reassigned to me on August 25, 2008, and I convened the hearing\n\n2\nas scheduled on September 9, 2008.  By way of stipulation, Government Exhibits (GXs)\n1 through 3, were received into evidence.  Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nsubmitted Exhibit (AppX) A, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (TR) on September 19, 2008.  The record closed on the date of the hearing,\nSeptember 9, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Withdraw\nDepartment Counsel moved to withdrew subparagraph 2.b. of the SOR.  This\nmotion was granted (TR at page 32 line 15 to page 33 line 12).\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the\nsubparagraphs of the SOR, other than 2.b.  He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  The Applicant is a 56 year old\nViet Nam Veteran, who served two stints with the Army from 1969~1971, and again\nfrom 1979~1991 (TR at page 4 lines 23~25, at page 43 lines 6~12, and at page 46 lines\n22~25).\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n1.a.  In May of 1995, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently was found\nguilty of, Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of alcohol (TR at page 24 line 13 to page 25\nline 1, and at page 48 line 16 to page 49 line 18).  As a result of this conviction, the\nApplicant was fined and placed on probation (Id).\n1.b.  In July of 2000, the Applicant was again arrested for, and subsequently was\nfound guilty of a DUI (TR at page 25 line 12 to page 25 line 1, and at page 54 line 1 to\npage 58 line 2).  As a result of this misdemeanor conviction, the Applicant served ten\ndays in jail, was fined, his license was suspended, and he was placed on probation for\nthree years (Id, and GX 3).\n1.c.  In August of 2001, the Applicant was cited for speeding, and driving with a\nsuspended license (TR at page 26 line 6 to page 27 line 13, and at page 58 line 3 to\npage 59 line 14).  He was involved in \u201ccritical ops [operations]\u201d regarding the assembly\nof a launch vehicle, and felt he had no other way to get to the Air Force Base (Id).  As\nhis presence was essential, he chose \u201cthe less of two evils,\u201d and knowingly drove to\nwork on a driver\u2019s license that has been suspended as a result of his 2000 DUI\nconviction (TR at page 26 line 6 to page 27 line 13, and at page 58 line 3 to page 59\nline 14).\n\n3\n1.d.  Finally, in March of 2003, was again cited for driving with a suspended\nlicense (TR at page 27 line 14 to page 28 line 19, and at page 59 line 15 to page 60 line\n18).  This was his last act of criminal conduct (Id).  He was placed on 24 months of\nunsupervised probation and fined (TR at page 27 line 14 to page 28 line 19, and at\npage 59 line 15 to page 60 line 18).\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n2.a.  The Applicant did not report his July 2000 DUI misdemeanor conviction to\nhis employer (TR at page 28 line 20 to page 29 line 21).  He had no affirmative\nobligation to do so, and no one inquired about it until June of 2007 (TR at page 62 line\n24 to page 68 line 3, and at page 68 line 9 to page 69 line 6).  In answer to \u201cSection 23:\nYour Police Record\u201d on his June 2007 e-QIP, the Applicant disclosed all of the\nrequested information regarding his misdemeanor conviction (Id, and GX 1 at page 26).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern relating\nto Criminal Conduct: ACriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.@\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Subparagraph 31(a) provides that \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses@ may be disqualifying.  As noted above, the Applicant had a DUI in 1995, and\nagain in 2000, and two serious citations, the last one being in March of 2003.  However,\nthis is countered by the first Mitigating Condition, as \u201cso much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened . . . that it is unlikely to recur . . . .\u201c  Here, the Applicant\nlast act of criminal conduct occurred more than five years ago, and has since led a\n\u201cpositive and productive\u201d life (AppX A at page 1).\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nParagraph 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nDisqualifying Condition under Subparagraph 16(d)(3) arguably applies.  It\nprovides that \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for ana adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment . . . .\u201d  Although the Applicant had no affirmative obligation to inform his\nemployer of his misdemeanor conviction, until he executed his June 2007 e-QIP, he\n\n5\nwould have been more forthcoming had he done so.  This is clearly countered,\nhowever, by the Mitigation Condition found under Subparagraph 17(c): \u201cso much time\nhas passed . . . that it is unlikely to recur and dies not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  This oversight by the Applicant occurred\nmore than eight years ago.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThose who know the Applicant, both in and out of the work place, speak most\nhighly of him (AppX B at pages 1~5).  Of particular note, are the comments of a United\nStates Probation Officer regarding Applicant\u2019s most recent act of Criminal Conduct.  He\navers, in part, the following: \u201c[The Applicant] . . . satisfactorily completed all terms of his\nprobation, and he was found to meet all statutory and local criteria for \u2018early termination\u2019\nof his probation.  His assigned probation officer petitioned the Court, and on August 20,\n2004, Magistrate Judge . . . ordered . . . [the Applicant] discharged from supervision and\nproceedings in this case terminated\u201d (AppX B the last page).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his Criminal Conduct and related Personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On January 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign\ninfluence (Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 15, 2008. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on April 15, 2008, and the hearing was held on May 22, 2008. Based\non a careful evaluation of all the evidence in the record, Applicant\u2019s eligibility of security\nclearance access is denied. \nAugust 4, 2008\n\n Applicant\u2019s father was born in 1953 in Pakistan, and employed as a taxi driver. He passed away in February\n1\n2005. Applicant traveled to Pakistan to attend the funeral. \n2\nAt the hearing, the government submitted two exhibits (GE). The third exhibit (GE\n3, administrative notice exhibit) contains publications from United States Government\nagencies that describe the government of Pakistan, its human rights record internally,\nits geopolitical relationship with neighboring countries in the Middle East, and the\nvarious difficulties U.S. citizens face in traveling to the country. At the hearing, testimony\nwas taken from Applicant and two witnesses. He also submitted two exhibits (AE A-AE\nB). DOHA received the transcript on June 5, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges in paragraph 1 that Applicant\u2019s ties and travel to Pakistan raise\nforeign influence concerns. He admitted subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. \nApplicant is 33 years old and married. He is employed as a senior network\nengineer by a defense contractor.

Applicant has\nnever had a security clearance. \nSOR 1.a. Applicant\u2019s mother  was born in Pakistan in June 1955. She resided in\n1\nthe country as a housewife until January 2008, when she immigrated to this country to\nlive with Applicant. When his mother lived in Pakistan, he called her about once a\nmonth.\nSOR 1.b. Applicant\u2019s 30-year-old brother was born, and is a resident citizen of\nPakistan. He is an information technology specialist who never worked for the\ngovernment of Pakistan. He is married with one son. His wife is a housewife like\nApplicant\u2019s mother. When Applicant\u2019s mother was living in Pakistan, she lived at a\nlocation where both brothers and one of Applicant\u2019s sisters also lived.

Applicant\u2019s employer requested a security clearance for\nApplicant so that there would be sufficient staff for special projects.\nAdministrative Notice\nPakistan is a parliamentary democracy. It has the world\u2019s largest armed forces,\nwhich is a very efficient force. Until 1990, the U.S. provided military aid to Pakistan.\nHowever, aid was suspended in response to the country\u2019s program to develop nuclear\nweapons. Following September 11, 2001, the sanctions were lifted in response to\nPakistani support for the U.S. campaign to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan, and the\noverall war on terrorism. In addition to resuming military aid, the U.S. also increased\neconomic assistance to Pakistan, provided necessary debt relief, and supported badly\nneeded educational reform.  \n2\nEven though improvements have been made, Pakistan\u2019s human rights record is\nstill considered poor, with police abuse and killings, poor prison conditions, violations of\nthe right to privacy, and continued efforts of executive pressure on the judiciary.3\nSeveral Pakistani political parties have periodically voiced strong anti-American\nsentiment.  Some extremist groups continue to target various Western interests in an\n4\neffort to reduce the level of Western influence in the country.  However, there is no\n5\nevidence demonstrating that Pakistan is an active collector of U.S. intelligence\ninformation. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\n\n5\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe security issues connected to foreign influence are familial ties, contacts,\nand/or proprietary/financial interests that could be used to generate a heightened risk of\nforcing an applicant into a position of having to choose between the foreign entity and\nthe U.S. \nAnalysis\n6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests result in security concerns\nwhere those contacts and interests create divided loyalties, or may be manipulated or\ninduced by a foreign entity that is harmful to U.S., or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign entity. Decisions under this guideline should include the foreign\ncountry where the contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to\nwhether the foreign government targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected information\nand/or is associated with the risk of terrorism.\u201d \n\n6\nThe government has established a preliminary basis for denying Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance application. His mother is still a citizen of Pakistan, even though she\nhas been living with Applicant in the U.S. since January 2008. His two brothers and his\nthree sisters are resident citizens of Pakistan. His family\u2019s Pakistani citizenship, when\nconsidered in light of the terrorist activities prevalent in the country, as well as the poor\nhuman rights record of the country\u2019s government, makes Applicant potentially\nvulnerable to coercion and pressure through his siblings and mother. Foreign Influence\n(FI) disqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) and FI DC 7.b. (connections to a\nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation) apply. The fact that Applicant\u2019s mother and siblings are still citizens and/or\nresident citizens of Pakistan constitute a heightened risk for foreign coercion and\npotential for conflict that shifts the burden to Applicant to show why he believes the\nheightened risk is manageable and he will resolve the conflict in favor of the U.S.\nSince Applicant\u2019s mother is still a citizen of Pakistan, and his siblings are still\nresident citizens of Pakistan, Applicant bears a heavy burden of showing his family\nmembers do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26983 (October 16, 2002) \nThree of the six mitigating conditions (MC) under the FI guideline may apply to\nthe facts and circumstances of this case: \nFC MC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\n FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation).\nThe discussion under FI MC 8.a. begins with Applicant\u2019s mother who has been a\nhousewife her entire life. She was never employed nor an agent of the Pakistani\ngovernment. She has not been in good health and was the reason for several of\n\n W hile the Appeal Board has held that the security concerns arising from the presence of an applicant\u2019s family\n6\nmembers in a foreign country are not mitigated by the possibility of a swift and safe departure from that\ncountry, I still recognize that Applicant is doing what he can to comply with the immigration laws so that his\nbrother can eventually emigrate to the U.S. See, ISCR Case No. 01-20908 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2003) \n7\nApplicant\u2019s visits to Pakistan. Applicant sponsored her immigration shortly after his\nfather died in 2005. She has been living with Applicant since January 2008. However,\nher Pakistani citizenship status still engenders FI concerns that are not sufficiently\nreduced by her temporary status in the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers are still living in Pakistan. One is an information\ntechnology specialist, and the other is a student. Though they are not agents of or\nemployed by the Pakistani government, their presence in that country creates a\nheightened risk of exploitation, inducement or pressure. Applicant\u2019s sponsorship of\nthree of his siblings does not immediately eliminate or reduce the risk for foreign\ncoercion or pressure  created by anti-western sentiment and terrorist activity in\n6\nPakistan. FI MC 8.a. does not apply given the heightened risk presented by his siblings\nin Pakistan. The same conclusion is reached under FI MC 8.b. as insufficient evidence\nhas been provided by Applicant to conclude that he can be expected to resolve any\nconflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn determining whether FI MC 8.c. applies, one must evaluate the entire picture\nof contacts that an applicant has with a family member in a foreign country, rather than\nthe contacts of each family member. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App Bd. Sept. 22,\n2003). Applicant\u2019s mother moved to the U.S. in January 2008, so his contacts with her\nare removed from the \u201ccontact\u201d equation, but she still remains a source for foreign\ninfluence because of her citizenship status. The DOHA Appeal Board has held there is\na rebuttable presumption that contacts with a foreign family member are not casual.\nISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002) Although contact with each sibling\nmay be casual and infrequent, Applicant\u2019s periodic contact with his five siblings at\ndifferent times of the year, together with his trips to Pakistan since 1999, raise a\nreasonable inference that those contacts are not casual or infrequent in nature. FI MC\n8.c. does not apply. Applicant has not satisfied his burden of persuasion under the FI\nguideline.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding against Applicant under the FI guideline must still be evaluated in the\ncontext of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n8\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant has five siblings who are resident citizens of Pakistan. While his mother\nis living with him in this country, she is still a citizen of Pakistan. Applicant is\ncommended for sponsoring three of his five siblings for immigration. But, their formal\ninclusion into the immigration process does not reduce the risks of foreign pressure\nbeing applied to and through them to Applicant. I have noted that Applicant has no\nfinancial interests or financial obligations in Pakistan, that he has never served in the\nPakistani military, that he has never voted or held foreign office, and that he maintains\nno other contacts with individuals he met in Pakistani schools. I have weighed the\naforementioned information with Applicant\u2019s growing ties to the U.S. He has earned a\ngood work record since July 2006. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions under the FI guideline, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns of foreign influence.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The first incident \noccurred in June 1996. The fifth and most recent incident occurred in June 2006. \nSummarized they are: \n \n(1) In June 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with theft by \nshoplifting. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) Applicant was 20 years old and in the Army. \nHaving just completed basic training, he was \u201cfeeling out in the world, \nseasoned and invincible.\u201d He went into a department store and \u201cwas \namused at what seemed to be a feeble security system.\u201d He shoplifted \na $20 item \u201cjust to show them,\u201d and got caught. Response to SOR, GE \n5, Tr. 77-80. \n \n\n \n \n3\n(2) In August 2003, Applicant was charged with Drive with License \nSuspended/Revoked/Cancelled, Stop Sign Violation, Failure to \nProduce Evidence of Financial Responsibility, and Violation of Promise \nto Appear. He was driving and pulled over for running a stop sign in a \nconstruction zone, which he said was not there. In October 2003, he \npled guilty to Drive with License Suspended/Revoked/Canceled and \nthe other charges were dismissed. He was sentenced to pay a fine. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.) He failed to appear because \u201cthe court again was pretty \nfar away and I didn\u2019t have a ride to it.\u201d Response to SOR, GE 10, GE \n11,Tr. 76-78. \n \n(3) In July 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with Threatening \nand Intimidating. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) Applicant explained this event occurred \nduring \u201cthe hardest time in my life. I had no job, no money, living in a \nslum with no air conditioning and facing eviction.\u201d Applicant and his \nformer fianc\u00e9 had a yard sale and raised $80. His fianc\u00e9 then drove to \na convenience store and while there mistakenly left her wallet in the \nstore. When she returned to retrieve it, all her money was gone. She \nreturned home and informed Applicant, who called the store and \nthreatened a male clerk answering the telephone, \u201cYou better give me \nmy $80, you (expletive deleted).\u201d Applicant told the clerk he would be \nat the store in ten minutes and blow his head off if he did not get his \nmoney back. Applicant called the store a short time later and a told a \nfemale clerk answering the telephone that he would \u201cblow off that \n(expletive deleted)\u2019s head\u201d if the money was not returned. Both clerks \nwere frightened and did not know what the Applicant was talking about \nbecause the wallet incident occurred before their shift. They called the \npolice, the police investigated the allegations, and were unable to \nsubstantiate that anyone stole the money. Their investigation did, \nhowever, result in Applicant being arrested. Applicant subsequently \npled guilty to the charge and was fined $150. Response to SOR, GE 9, \nTr. 72-78. \n \n(4) In February 2005, Applicant was charged with Drive with License \nSuspended, Failure to Appear and Failure to Produce Evidence of \nFinancial Responsibility. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Applicant\u2019s former fianc\u00e9 was \ndriving the two of them around town at night and she became ill. \nApplicant took the wheel and was pulled over \u201cbecause my license \nplate wasn\u2019t properly illuminated.\u201d He pled guilty to Drive with License \nSuspended and Failure to Appear. The Failure to Produce Financial \nResponsibility charged was dismissed, and he was fined. Response to \nSOR, GE 8, Tr. 69-72. \n \n(5) In June 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Dangerous \nDrugs/Equipment for Manufacturing, a felony. In May 2007, he pled \nguilty to the amended charge of Attempted Possession of Chemicals \nor Equipment, or both, for the Purpose of Manufacturing a Dangerous \n\n \n \n4\nDrug, a felony. He was sentenced to two years probation, and a \n$1,000 fine and other costs. (SOR \u00b6 1a.) Applicant stated that he read \nan article about the ease of producing methamphetamine, and claimed \nthat because of his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and not \nhaving taken his medication (Effexor), he \u201cdecided\u201d to collect the \ningredients to manufacture methamphetamine. \u201c[B]laming\u201d the police \nfor his \u201cagonized state of mind,\u201d he decided to embarrass them and \npurchase methamphetamine ingredients on line. He ordered and \nreceived the ingredients. \u201c[A]bout two months later,\u201d the police arrived, \nquestioned him, searched his apartment, and ultimately arrested him. \nApplicant testified and stated in his Response to SOR that he pled \nguilty even though he was not guilty to avoid a possible lengthy prison \nsentence. His defense counsel, a public defender, \u201csuggested\u201d that he \nhave a competency hearing, and also offered to get him another \nattorney. Applicant declined both offers and eventually pled guilty \u201cto \npreserve my freedom and get on with my life.\u201d Applicant testified that \nhis attorney submitted a request to the court for an early release of his \nprobation and reduce his felony charge to a misdemeanor. After his \nhearing, Applicant did submit court documents reflecting that his \nprobation had, indeed, been terminated in March 2009, but the \ndocuments did not reflect his felony had been reduced to a \nmisdemeanor.

The facts regarding this allegation discussed supra are incorporated under this \nconcern. \n \nIn his January 2006 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed, as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.d., a \nFebruary 2003 driving on a suspended license. He failed to disclose his July 2004 arrest \nfor Threatening/Intimidating in response to Section 23, regarding his police record \n(asking whether in the last seven years he had been arrested for, charged with, or \nconvicted of any offenses not listed in sections a \u2013 e). \n \nIn the same e-QIP, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 28(a) and 28(b) (asking \nwhether in the last seven years he had been 180 days delinquent on any debts, and \nwhether he was currently 90 days delinquent on any debts, respectively). SOR \u00b6 4.c. \nalleged he failed to list debts as stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a., 3.c., and 3.p. \n \nWhen asked by Department Counsel why he failed to provide complete answers \nto Section 23 and Sections 28(a) and (b), he responded, \u201cI forgot, \u201c and \u201cI forgot that \ntoo. I didn\u2019t remember some of those things,\u201d respectively. Tr. 131. In his Response to \nSOR, he added that his failure to disclose information supra was not deliberate. \n \nCharacter evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted numerous e-mails documenting his church involvement, \ngenealogy assistance, and assistance provided to church members and non-church \nmembers. AE A-AE W. He submitted employee performance evaluations from 2004 to \n2008 that indicate he meets or exceeds employer goals and \u201cis a valued member of \n[employer\u2019s] organization.\u201d AE X through AE BB. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n\n \n \n6\nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism.  \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n \nConclusions \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are raised under Guidelines J (criminal conduct), H (drug involvement), F \n(financial considerations), and E (personal conduct) with respect to the allegations set \nforth in the SOR. \n\n \n \n7\nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions; \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program; and \n \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year.  \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply. Applicant most recently was convicted of a drug-\nrelated felony in May 2007. He was also convicted of at least four misdemeanors in \n1996, 2003, 2004, and 2005, discussed supra.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n\n \n \n8\n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s five skirmishes with the law began in 1996 with a shoplifting arrest to \n\u201ctest\u201d store security. In 2003, he was arrested for driving-related offenses. In 2004, he \nwas arrested for threatening and intimidating a store clerk, and in 2005, he was arrested \nfor driving-related offenses. In 2006, he was arrested and convicted of Attempted \nPossession of Chemicals or Equipment, or both, for the Purpose of Manufacturing a \nDangerous Drug. Although granted an early release from probation in March 2009, he \nstill remains convicted of a felony. This coupled with his ten-year history of arrests \nprecludes application of any potential mitigating conditions under this concern. \nApplicant\u2019s past conduct clearly calls into question his ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations, and falls short of what is expected of those entrusted \nwith a security clearance. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug involvement-related conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying conditions could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: \u201c(a) any drug \nabuse,\u201d1 and \u201c(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  \n \n    \nApplicant\u2019s guilty plea to attempted possession of chemicals or equipment, or \nboth, for the purpose of manufacturing a dangerous drug2 warrants full application of \nAG \u00b625(c). When arrested, he had ingredients to manufacture methamphetamine. The \nauthorities did not accept his explanation that he was \u201ctesting\u201d the police and held him \naccountable. Although he was released from probation early, he still remains convicted \nof a drug-related felony.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n1AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n2AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \n\n \n \n9\n                                                          \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nThe evidence does not involve any drug abuse, but rather is limited to attempted \npossession of chemicals or equipment, or both, for the purpose of manufacturing \nmethamphetamine. The particular facts of this case preclude application of any \nmitigating conditions involving drug use. \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d3 \n \n3 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board \nstated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \n\n \n \n10\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s drug-related arrest occurred in June \n2006, 14 days before he completed his e-QIP on January 30, 2006, and his May 1, \n2007 drug-related conviction was two years before this hearing. Although the drug \ninvolvement in question is limited to one incident, it was a drug-related felony conviction. \nI consider Applicant\u2019s early release from probation in March 2009, one month before his \nhearing, as recent and an insufficient period of time to evaluate his conduct. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, and his SOR \nresponse. At the time of Applicant\u2019s hearing, he had submitted no mitigating evidence. \nBased on evidence presented and Applicant\u2019s admissions, the government established \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nthe Administrative Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe Administrative Judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n \n11\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant\u2019s made a concerted effort to clean up his credit \nhistory and come to terms with his creditors. He apparently was able to contact all of his \ncreditors except one, and paid, settled, or arranged payment plans. Such notable efforts \nwarrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(e). The remaining mitigating conditions \nunder this concern are not applicable. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n\n \n \n12\n                                                          \nApplicant disclosed only one of his criminal offenses\u2014his 2003 arrest and \nconviction for driving on a suspended license. He did not disclose his 2004 arrest for \nthreatening/intimidating (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). Furthermore, he did not disclose any debts over \n180 days delinquent or currently over 90 days delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both \napply.4 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \n \n4Deliberate and materially false answers on a security clearance application may violate 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 \n(1995) as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision \nmaking body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. \n2004). If Applicant had provided accurate answers on his security clearance applications, his accurate \nanswers are capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance. His criminal offenses \nare sufficiently serious to potentially jeopardize approval of his security clearance. Making a false \nstatement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential sentence includes \nconfinement for five years and a $10,000 fine). In light of my ultimate decision, and the absence of an \nalleged violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 in the SOR, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether or not \nApplicant actually violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \n\n \n \n13\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s explanations for his \nomissions were that he forgot to list them and that his omissions were not deliberate. I \ndo not find his testimony or explanations credible regarding his state of mind when he \ncompleted his security clearance application. I note that he recalled the 2004 \nthreatening/intimidating incident with great clarity during his testimony and in his pre-\nhearing responses. I do not accept his explanation that he forgot to list it on his e-QIP, \nbut did remember his 2003 traffic-related arrest. Furthermore, given the state of his \nfinancial history, I do not find his explanation credible that he forgot to list any \nindebtedness on his e-QIP. Simply put, his statement at his hearing about his reasons \nfor not disclosing his arrest history and indebtedness is not credible. He was well aware \nof more than one offense and that he owed creditors money. He knowingly and \ndeliberately chose not to disclose full information about the extent of his criminal past or \nhis indebtedness. \n \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nWhole Person Concept. Applicant receives credit for his Army service and having \nsuccessfully held a security clearance for 11 months while in the Army. He has also \nshown significant community service through his volunteer work with his church and on \nhis own. His efforts to address his past due bills after his hearing are noteworthy. His \nduty performance with his employer is good. Aside from the SOR allegations, no other \ndisciplinary or security-related problems surfaced. His record of favorable employment \nweighs in his favor. There is some compelling evidence of his responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation. I am convinced that he is loyal to his company, his church \nand his country.   \n\n \n \n14\n  \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 felony drug-related arrest and deliberate failure to disclose \ninformation on his security clearance application are serious, recent, and not mitigated. \nHis misdemeanor arrests coupled with his recent felony arrest establish a ten-year \nhistory of failure to comply with the law. He was not candid about why he failed to \nprovide full and complete information on his e-QIP. I have serious questions about his \ncurrent ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that he has mitigated security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations, but he has not mitigated security concerns \npertaining to criminal conduct, drug involvement, and personal conduct.    \n \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

MacKinnon, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph Testan, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 4, 2011, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological\nConditions), Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn April 25, 2012, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.  In a Remand Order dated August 17, 2012, the Appeal Board remanded the case to\nthe Judge.  The remand resulted from the Board\u2019s conclusion that the Judge has failed to consider\nan important aspect of the case, namely Applicant\u2019s allegedly improper contact with young girls.\nOn September 10, 2012, the Judge issued a Remand Decision again granting Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Department Counsel again appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.   \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge failed to\ndiscuss critical aspects of the evidentiary record; (b) whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions under\nGuideline D are arbitrary and capricious; (c) whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions under Guideline E are\narbitrary and capricious; and (d) whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable.  For\nthe reasons discussed below, the Board remands the Judge\u2019s favorable Remand Decision.\nIn his Remand Decision the Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant\nheld a security clearance from 1977 to 1985 and again from 1995 to 2007.  He has never had a\nsecurity violation.  His security officer speaks most highly of the Applicant.\n Applicant grew up in what was, in many ways, a dysfunctional family.  In his mother\u2019s eyes\nhe was \u201csupposed to be a girl,\u201d and she treated him as she would a daughter.  By age five, Applicant\nwas cross dressing, and by age eight, he began engaging in sadomasochistic acts by injuring himself.\nHis sadomasochistic behavior ceased in about 2004, and his treating psychiatrist gives Applicant\ninjections of medication to control his obsessive behavior.  Applicant admits he has sought\nappropriate, non-sexual contact with young girls.  However, Applicant denies that he is sexually\nattracted to, or has fantasies about inappropriate conduct with, young girls.  He avers that the\nGovernment polygrapher put words in his mouth.  Based on observations of the Applicant, and on\nthe extensive outpouring of support by those who know Applicant, as evidenced by 14 letters of\nsupport, his denials and testimony are most credible.\nFrom 1980 to 1983 Applicant saw Psychiatrist A for a condition initially diagnosed as\nAnxiety Reaction, and later changed to Depressive Neurosis.  He was prescribed medication to treat\nhis depression.  When Psychiatrist A moved, Applicant saw Psychiatrist B about every two weeks\nfrom 1983 until Psychiatrist B passed away in 1998.  In 1995, Psychiatrist B noted that Applicant\nwas suffering from depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive behavior.  He found no immoral\nor deviant behavior.  Applicant\u2019s prognosis was fair, and the doctor noted that good progress was\nmade.  The doctor found no impairment in judgment or reliability.  Since 1998, Applicant has seen\nPsychiatrist C every two weeks for treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  In September\n\n3\n2009, this treating psychiatrist noted that he was satisfied with the current state of therapy.  He noted\nthat Applicant had good control of his behavior and is highly unlikely to be influenced, coerced, or\nmanipulated because of his fantasies.  In March 2011, Psychiatrist C further noted that Applicant\nis truthful and conscientious and would not permit his private fantasies to interfere with his ability\nto protect sensitive government information.\nIn 2007, another government agency denied Applicant access to Sensitive Compartmented\nInformation (SCI), based on allegations similar to those contained in the SOR.  \nIn December 2008, Applicant met with a government psychologist for an hour.  Based on\nthat meeting and a review of unspecified records, the psychologist found a DSM IV diagnosis of\nObsessive Compulsive Disorder, Major Depression, recurrent, Pedophilia, Transvestic Festishism\n(sic) and Sexual Masochism and Sadism.  He further found a defect in judgment, and less so in\nreliability at that time, and concluded that these manifestations were likely to continue in the future.\nIn September 2010, the same government psychologist, armed with a review of specified records,\ngave a more thorough psychological report.  He reiterated his previous diagnosis, but noted that\nApplicant displayed no evidence of a defect in judgment, reliability or trustworthiness at work.  The\npsychologist noted that when Applicant had sufficient duties at work to keep him preoccupied, he\nfelt productive, effective, appropriate, and like a valued contributor.\nIn February 2012, Psychiatrist C stated that Applicant does not have a medical condition, nor\nis he receiving medical treatment that impairs his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness in\nsafeguarding classified information\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions:  A government psychologist saw the Applicant\nin December of 2008 and rendered an opinion regarding a condition that caused the psychologist\nto question Applicant\u2019s judgment.  This is countered, however, by the opinion of Applicant\u2019s\ntreating psychiatrist, who has seen Applicant every two weeks for the last 14 years.  Mitigation\napplies as there is no indication of a current problem.  Most recently, the treating psychiatrist opined\nthat Applicant does not have a medical condition, nor is he receiving medical treatment that impairs\nhis judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness in safeguarding classified national security information.\nDisqualifying conditions under the Sexual Behavior Guideline are arguably applicable here.\nApplicant has a history of sadomasochistic acts.  However, his last act of sadomasochism occurred\nmore than seven years ago, and he is administered injections to prevent any future such acts.  The\nbehavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.  The Applicant\u2019s security\nofficer knows of his condition, and the Applicant\u2019s spouse is also aware of it.  Under the Personal\nConduct Guideline, the Applicant was denied access to SCI by another government agency in 2007.\nThis is countered, however, by the fact that so much time has passed. . . that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Since\nthen, his treating psychiatrist has deemed the Applicant to be trustworthy.  Applicant has the\nunqualified support of those who know him in the work place and the community.  There are no\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n\n1 This section of the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision also added a brief portion of the testimony of Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity officer, wherein the witness stated she was familiar with the evidence against Applicant, and the allegations\nagainst him.  The witness then opined that Applicant could handle classified information appropriately, that he should\nhave his clearance reinstated, that he was not a pedophile, and that she would trust him alone with her granddaughters.\n4\nThe main thrust of Department Counsel\u2019s arguments on appeal is that, after remand, the\nJudge\u2019s consideration and analysis of the issue of Applicant\u2019s thoughts and interactions with young\ngirls remains both erroneous and inadequate.  Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s failure\nto properly address this issue affected his overall analysis of the case under the multiple\nAdjudicative Guidelines set forth in the SOR.  The Board agrees.  In our Remand Order, the Board\nconcluded that the record evidence of Applicant\u2019s encounters with female children was an important\naspect of the case that the Judge\u2019s original Decision did not address.  Despite a slightly expanded\nanalysis, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision suffers from the same basic\ninfirmity.\nThere is a large volume of evidence in this case regarding the issue of Applicant and female\nchildren.  The record evidence reveals that this issue has essentially two components: (a) Applicant\u2019s\nthoughts and desires concerning young female children, and (b) actual physical contact between\nApplicant and young female children.  Applicant also has a history of psychological problems\nseparate and apart from any interest in young girls.  Any meaningful analysis of the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns must include an overall evaluation of  these components in relation to one another\nunder all the Adjudicative Guidelines proffered in the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s thoughts about young girls\nare directly related to his actions with young girls and vice versa. These issues should also be\nevaluated in the context of Applicant\u2019s other psychological manifestations.  The Judge\u2019s Remand\nDecision takes a piecemeal approach where some of these issues are discussed under individual\nguidelines but others are not addressed at all.  It is instructive to note that the evidence of a diagnosis\nof pedophilia, as well as Applicant\u2019s thoughts and interactions regarding young girls\u2013 arguably the\nmost potent evidence of concern in the evidentiary record\u2013 is not specifically mentioned or\ndiscussed anywhere in the analysis section of the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision.    \nDepartment Counsel objects to the Judge\u2019s findings regarding Applicant\u2019s issues with young\ngirls.  She states that the Judge\u2019s fact-finding is clearly erroneous and is contradicted by admissions\nmade by Applicant.  She states that the Judge essentially substituted a favorable credibility\ndetermination for a critical examination of record facts.  She then asserts that there is no reasonable\nbasis for the credibility determination made by the Judge.  These arguments have merit.\nIn the original Decision, the full extent of the Judge\u2019s fact-finding on the issue of Applicant\u2019s\ninterest in young girls consisted only of the Judge\u2019s notation that Applicant denied the allegations\nin the SOR, (fantasies about inappropriate conduct with young girls, non-sexual contact with young\ngirls) and claimed that a government polygrapher put words in his mouth.  The Judge then stated that\nan extensive outpouring of support for Applicant by those who knew him plus his observations of\nApplicant supported a finding that Applicant\u2019s denials and his testimony were most credible.  The\nfindings in the Remand Decision differ only slightly from those in the original, and, practically\nspeaking, include only one additional sentence.1  In that sentence, the Judge notes that Applicant\n\nThe Judge offers no comments about this testimony, other than to find, by way of introduction, that \u201cHis Security Officer\nspeaks most highly of the Applicant.\u201d  The Judge does not relate the colloquy to any other evidence.  Its probative value\nis limited in that it provides no specifics as to which thoughts and actions of Applicant toward young girls the witness\nwas aware of.  The witness also offered a medical opinion that she was not qualified to make.  Therefore, the inclusion\nof this package of testimony, though an expansion of the Judge\u2019s original decision, does not satisfy the Board\u2019s Remand\nOrder instruction to address an important aspect of the case, either considered alone, or in conjunction with the additional\nsentence referenced above.     \n2Govt. Exhibit 3, Govt. Exhibit 10.\n3 Id.\n4 Id.\n5 Id.\n6 Id.\n7 Id.\n5\nadmits he has sought appropriate, non-sexual contact with young girls.  The Judge\u2019s earlier notations\nabout Applicant\u2019s denials of sexual attraction, fantasies about inappropriate conduct, and his\naverment that the government polygrapher put words in his mouth were repeated.  As in the original\nDecision, the Judge then referenced his observations of Applicant and the indication of support from\nothers when finding that Applicant\u2019s denials were credible.\nThe Board concluded in its Remand Order that the Judge\u2019s original finding that Applicant\nhad not sought out contact with young girls was unsustainable.  Now the Judge has found that\nApplicant has sought out and obtained appropriate, non-sexual contact with young girls.  Department\nCounsel argues that such a finding runs contrary to the record evidence.  The Board agrees.  We\nexamine a Judge\u2019s findings to see if they are supported by substantial record evidence, which is\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.2.  See also ISCR Case\nNo. 11-02087 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2012).  In this case the record evidence includes the\nfollowing: (a) an admission in 2006 that during the preceding 10 to 15 years, Applicant realized he\nwas attracted to girls from age three to twelve2; (b) an admission that he had the desire to touch a\nyoung girl in a sexual manner and that he had \u201c. . . lots of desires in my head.\u201d3; (c) an admission\nby Applicant that there is something in his head that is \u201cconsiderably dangerous\u201d and that he worries\nabout it4; (d) an admission that as long as he only did things to himself, he was reasonably safe, but\nthere were worse things a person could do, and he was attracted to young girls, and he knew that this\nwas the most dangerous thing5; (e) an admission that he might masturbate to the memory of contacts\nwith little girls or might want to wrap his arms around a young girl and masturbate later.6; (f) a\nstatement admitting a desire to lick a young girl\u2019s genitals7; (g) testimony from Applicant where he\nindicated that he approached the polygraph and interviews (the source of the admissions and\nevidence listed above) in a manner that was fully cooperative, and that he was \u201cblisteringly honest\u201d\n\n8 Transcript at 64, 65, 79.\n9 Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, 2009 Statement.\n10 Government Exhibit 3, Government Exhibit10; Transcript at 85-89, 90-91, 100.\n11 Government Exhibit 10. \n12 Transcript at 88-89.\n6\nwith the polygraph examiner8; (h) an opinion from Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist that he believed\nApplicant had been honest with the polygrapher9;  (i) evidence, partly derived from the treatment\nnotes of Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, of numerous instances of physical contact with young\ngirls, to include kissing, scratching, rubbing of the back, wrapping of the arms around them, and\nhaving them sit in his lap10; (j) evidence of incidents such as Applicant seeking and engaging in\ncontact with a young girl in a park which provoked a strong response from the girl\u2019s father,\nApplicant kissing four-year-old girls on the head at his son\u2019s preschool which prompted a complaint\nfrom a parent and a warning from the school, and a forty minute encounter with a five-year-old girl\nat a library where Applicant sat her on his lap and put his arms around her and later described the\nincident as a \u201ccourtship\u201d11; and (k) while denying during his testimony at his hearing that there was\nany sexual gratification motivation behind his obsession with little girls, he did state that the\nphysical contact gave him a \u201cwarm and protective\u201d feeling.12       \nThis large body of evidence was barely mentioned by the Judge in his findings of fact, and,\nas indicated earlier, it was mentioned only in the context of noting Applicant\u2019s general denial of any\nimproper or questionable conduct.  The Judge then found Applicant credible, and accepted\nApplicant\u2019s denial without making any attempt to analyze the evidence or evaluate it in the context\nof other record evidence.  Applicant\u2019s later denials of improper conduct or sexual thoughts or\nmotivations toward young girls was evidence that the Judge was entitled to consider.  Also, the\nexpert opinion evidence regarding pedophilia can best be described as mixed.  However, setting\naside the issue of whether or not Applicant\u2019s attraction to and contact with young girls had a sexual\ncomponent, given the record evidence cited in the preceding paragraph, the Board concludes that\nthe record provides no basis for any reasonable person to view Applicant\u2019s interactions with young\ngirls as appropriate conduct. \nWithout a meaningful discussion of the evidence regarding the issue of Applicant and young\ngirls, little is left in the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision beyond a credibility determination.  The Judge\nfound Applicant\u2019s denials of sexual or inappropriate conduct credible, notwithstanding the fact that\nthe denials conflict significantly with numerous previous admissions made by Applicant over an\nextended period of time.  The deference owed to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations does not\nimmunize them from review, nor does it preclude the Board from concluding that a challenged\ncredibility determination cannot be sustained.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0356 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.\n21, 1998).  The Judge\u2019s credibility determination is flawed inasmuch as it ignores the inconsistencies\nin Applicant\u2019s version of events while at the same time insinuating that the government polygrapher\nengaged in improper conduct  in interviewing Applicant and recording his responses.  The Board\n\n13 Transcript at 80-82; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.\n7\nhas long recognized that Federal agencies and their employees, like the polygrapher, are entitled to\na presumption of good faith and regularity in the performance of their responsibilities.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 11-03452 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2012).  This presumption is not overcome by the\nJudge\u2019s reliance solely on the testimony of Applicant without additional objective evidence\ncorroborating misconduct on the part of the polygrapher or malfeasance in the performance of his\nduties.  \nMoreover, the Judge proffers Applicant\u2019s averment \u201cthat the Government polygrapher put\nwords in his mouth\u201d as a blanket statement, presumably to discount all evidence of Applicant\u2019s\nsexually motivated or inappropriate thoughts and actions involving young girls.  The record does\nnot support this blanket finding of fact.  The only instance where Applicant offers any evidence at\nall about the polygrapher suggesting an answer or forcing him into an answer he did not believe to\nbe true was the discussion about Applicant\u2019s thoughts concerning licking a young girl\u2019s genitals.13\nEven if Applicant\u2019s version of events is accepted in this specific instance, it would not significantly\nundercut the numerous other admissions made by Applicant regarding young girls, where Applicant\nhas made no suggestion that the contents of the polygrapher\u2019s reports of investigation are inaccurate.\nThe Judge\u2019s credibility determination is also based in large part on the \u201cextensive outpouring\nof support by those who know Applicant.\u201d  This, too, was evidence that the Judge was entitled to\nconsider, and it has some probative value in assessing Applicant\u2019s character and reputation.\nHowever, the probative value of such evidence as a determinant of Applicant\u2019s credibility is\nsignificantly limited by the fact that none of the 14 letters of support indicate any knowledge of the\nallegations in the SOR.  The letters are overwhelmingly concerned with Applicant\u2019s professional\nskills and reputation.  Those that comment on his honesty (approximately half) do not do so outside\nthe context of the workplace.  Only two of the letters indicate that the writers knew about\nApplicant\u2019s loss of an earlier security clearance.  Only one mentions his personal life.  The Judge\nfails to explain how the content of these letters bolsters the believability of Applicant\u2019s denials,\ngiven the countervailing evidence in the record.\nTo summarize, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination of\nApplicant was improperly used as a substitute for record evidence in this case.  The credibility\ndetermination itself is unsustainable absent a more cogent explanation than currently exists as to\nwhy  Applicant\u2019s current denials are more believable than his extensive earlier admissions.\nDepartment Counsel asserts, accurately, that the record demonstrates that Applicant had a\ncomplex mental health condition that has manifested itself in many ways over his lifetime.  Her\nfurther assertion that the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision does not fully examine the complexity of this\nprofile is fair criticism.  The failure of the Judge to adequately consider Applicant\u2019s issues with\nyoung girls has already been discussed.  Additionally, the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline I does\nnot discuss the various other components of Applicant\u2019s psychological profile, such as his self-\ndamaging sadomasochistic behavior or his sexually violent fantasies toward adult women.  The state\nof the expert opinion evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s mental condition, which the Judge does\n\n8\nmention, is conflicting, and as such does not mandate a particular conclusion.  However, the expert\nopinion evidence must be evaluated in the context of Applicant\u2019s psychological history as a whole\nas well as Applicant\u2019s behavior.    \nSimilarly, the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline D talks only about the history of\nsadomasochistic acts while neglecting to analyze, or at least comment upon, those acts in the context\nof Applicant\u2019s fantasies and his contact with young girls.  In light of the Board\u2019s conclusions\nconcerning the sustainability of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and his credibility determination, the\nissue of whether there was a sexual context involved with Applicant\u2019s attraction to young girls\nshould be re-evaluated.  \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision mentions only the denial of access to SCI\nby another government agency in 2007, without any analysis as to underlying conduct.  Given the\nBoard\u2019s conclusion that the record evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s interactions with young\ngirls were inappropriate, and given the Board\u2019s conclusion that there is significant evidence\nindicating that Applicant\u2019s interest in young girls had a sexual orientation, a specific discussion is\nneeded as to whether this evidences questionable judgment that is of security concern regardless of\nthe passage of time.\nBoth Department Counsel and Applicant make various other arguments on appeal.  The\nBoard will not address these.  In essence, these arguments amount to each side offering its\ninterpretation of the record evidence.  While each side offers an interpretation that is plausible,\nneither establishes that the other interpretation is unsupported by the record evidence.   \n  \nIn his Remand Decision, the Judge made a slightly modified finding of fact (that the\nApplicant sought out and engaged in appropriate conduct with young girls as opposed to a finding\nthat he had not sought out contact with young girls in his original Decision).  This modified finding\nis not sustainable.  The Judge did not correct his earlier failure to engage in a meaningful discussion\nof Applicant\u2019s issues with young girls, nor did he relate those issues to other evidence in the case.\nThe Judge also engaged in a piecemeal analysis of Guidelines I, J and E, and left out important\naspects of the case in his analysis of each.  The Board remands the case to the Judge for correction\nof these errors and the others discussed in this Decision.\nOrder    \nIn accordance with the Board\u2019s preceding discussion, the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision is\nREMANDED.  The Judge shall issue a new Decision consistent with the analysis contained herein.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett          \nJeffrey D.

    "discussion": "of the evidence regarding the issue of Applicant and young girls, little is left in the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision beyond a credibility determination. The Judge found Applicant\u2019s denials of sexual or inappropriate conduct credible, notwithstanding the fact that the denials conflict significantly with numerous previous admissions made by Applicant over an extended period of time. The deference owed to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations does not immunize them from review, nor does it preclude the Board from concluding that a challenged credibility determination cannot be sustained. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0356 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 21, 1998). The Judge\u2019s credibility determination is flawed inasmuch as it ignores the inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s version of events while at the same time insinuating that the government polygrapher engaged in improper conduct in interviewing Applicant and recording his responses. The Board 13 Transcript at 80-82; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR. 7 has long recognized that Federal agencies and their employees, like the polygrapher, are entitled to a presumption of good faith and regularity in the performance of their responsibilities. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-03452 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2012). This presumption is not overcome by the Judge\u2019s reliance solely on the testimony of Applicant without additional objective evidence corroborating misconduct on the part of the polygrapher or malfeasance in the performance of his duties. Moreover, the Judge proffers Applicant\u2019s averment \u201cthat the Government polygrapher put words in his mouth\u201d as a blanket statement, presumably to discount all evidence of Applicant\u2019s sexually motivated or inappropriate thoughts and actions involving young girls. The record does not support this blanket finding of fact. The only instance where Applicant offers any evidence at all about the polygrapher suggesting an answer or forcing him into an answer he did not believe to be true was the discussion about Applicant\u2019s thoughts concerning licking a young girl\u2019s genitals.13 Even if Applicant\u2019s version of events is accepted in this specific instance, it would not significantly undercut the numerous other admissions made by Applicant regarding young girls, where Applicant has made no suggestion that the contents of the polygrapher\u2019s reports of investigation are inaccurate. The Judge\u2019s credibility determination is also based in large part on the \u201cextensive outpouring of support by those who know Applicant.\u201d This, too, was evidence that the Judge was entitled to consider, and it has some probative value in assessing Applicant\u2019s character and reputation. However, the probative value of such evidence as a determinant of Applicant\u2019s credibility is significantly limited by the fact that none of the 14 letters of support indicate any knowledge of the allegations in the SOR. The letters are overwhelmingly concerned with Applicant\u2019s professional skills and reputation. Those that comment on his honesty (approximately half) do not do so outside the context of the workplace. Only two of the letters indicate that the writers knew about Applicant\u2019s loss of an earlier security clearance. Only one mentions his personal life. The Judge fails to explain how the content of these letters bolsters the believability of Applicant\u2019s denials, given the countervailing evidence in the record. To summarize, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination of Applicant was improperly used as a substitute for record evidence in this case. The credibility determination itself is unsustainable absent a more cogent explanation than currently exists as to why Applicant\u2019s current denials are more believable than his extensive earlier admissions. Department Counsel asserts, accurately, that the record demonstrates that Applicant had a complex mental health condition that has manifested itself in many ways over his lifetime. Her further assertion that the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision does not fully examine the complexity of this profile is fair criticism. The failure of the Judge to adequately consider Applicant\u2019s issues with young girls has already been discussed. Additionally, the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline I does not discuss the various other components of Applicant\u2019s psychological profile, such as his self- damaging sadomasochistic behavior or his sexually violent fantasies toward adult women. The state of the expert opinion evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s mental condition, which the Judge does 8 mention, is conflicting, and as such does not mandate a particular",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Joseph Testan, Esquire\nApril 25, 2012\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on October\n16, 2007.  On February 4, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nI, D and E for the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 15, 2011.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing on March 14, 2011, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on March 17, 2011, and I received\nthe case assignment on January 24, 2012.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJanuary 26, 2012, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 22, 2012.  The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 10, which were received without\n\n2\nobjection.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf, as did his Security Officer, and\nsubmitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through F, which were received without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (TR) on March 7, 2012.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s\nrequests, one made at his hearing and the other one after his hearing, to keep the\nrecord open until April 10, 2012, to submit additional matters, to include a Closing\nArgument.  On March 22, 2012, through Department Counsel, the Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nsubmitted \u201cApplicant\u2019s Closing Argument.\u201d  The record closed on April 10, 2012.  Based\nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a.,~1.e. of the SOR, with explanations.  He denied the factual\nallegations in Subparagraphs 1.f.~1.i, 2.a. and 3.a. of the SOR.  He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nPsychological Conditions & Sexual Behavior\nThe Applicant held a security clearance \u201cfrom 1977 to 1985,\u201d and again from\n1995 to 2007.  (TR at page 60 line 17 to page 67 line 10.)  He has never had a security\nviolation.  (Id.)  His Security Officer speaks most highly of the Applicant.  (TR at page 41\nline 9 to page 52 line 18.)\n1.a.~1.i. and 2.a.  The Applicant grew up in what was in many ways a\ndysfunctional family.  He was \u201cthe youngest of three sons\u201d; but in his mother\u2019s eyes, he\n\u201cwas supposed to be a girl.\u201d  (TR at page 65 line 5 to page 67 line 10.)  His mother\ntreated him as she would a daughter.  By age five he was cross dressing, and by age\neight he began engaging in sadomasochistic acts by injuring himself.  (Id.)  His\nsadomasochistic behavior ceased in about 2004, and his treating Psychiatrist gives the\nApplicant injections of medication to control his obsessive behavior.  (GX 3 at pages\n9~11.)\nIt is also alleged that the Applicant is sexually attracted to young girls, has\nfantasies about inappropriate conduct with young girls, and has sought non-sexual\ncontact with young girls.  (GX 3 at pages 14~15, 17~19 and 22~23.)  The Applicant\ndenies these allegations, and avers that Government polygrapher put words in his\nmouth.  (TR at page 80 line 14 to page 84 line 9.)  Based on the extensive outpouring of\nsupport by those who know the Applicant, I find his denials and his testimony to be most\ncredible.  (AppX B.)\nFrom 1980~1983, the Applicant saw Psychiatrist A for a condition initially\ndiagnosed as Anxiety Reaction, and later changed to Depressive Neurosis.  (TR at\npage 67 line 11 to page 68 line 18, and GX 3 at page 9.)  He was prescribed medication\nto treat his Depression.  (Id.)  When Psychiatrist A moved, the Applicant saw\n\n3\nPsychiatrist B, who had purchased Psychiatrist A\u2019s practice.  (TR at page 68 line 19 to\npage 72 line 13.)\nPsychiatrist B saw the Applicant about every two weeks from 1983 until\nPsychiatrist B passed away in 1998.  (Id, and TR at page 72 lines 21~23.)  In October\nof 1995, this treating psychiatrist answered a \u201cMedical Information Questionnaire\u201d\nregarding the Applicant.  (GX 6.)  In part, Psychiatrist B noted that the Applicant was\nsuffering from, \u201cDepression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behavior.\u201d  (GX 6 at\npage 1.)  He found \u201cno immoral or deviant behavior.\u201d  (Id.)  His prognosis was \u201cfair good\nprogress made.\u201d  (GX 6 at page 2.)  He found \u201cno impairment\u201d in judgement or\nreliability.  (Id.)\nSince 1998, the Applicant has seen Psychiatrist C every two weeks \u201cfor\ntreatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.\u201d  (TR at page 72 line 14 to page 75 line\n11, at page 115 line 1 to page 116 line 14, GX 9, and AppX A at pages 3 and 4.)  In\nSeptember of 2009, this treating Psychiatrist noted, in part, the following: \u201cI am satisfied\nwith the current state of therapy.  He has good control of his behavior and is highly\nunlikely to be influenced, coerced, or manipulated because of his fantasies.\u201d  (AppX A at\npage 4.)  In March of 2011, his treating Psychiatrist further noted that the Applicant \u201cis\ntruthful and conscientious and would not permit his private fantasies to interfere with his\nability to protect sensitive government information.\u201d\nHowever, in December of 2008, the Applicant met with a Government\nPsychiatrist for an hour; and based on that meeting and a review of unspecified\nrecords, he found a \u201cDSM IV diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Major\nDepression, recurrent, Pedophilia, Transvestic Festishism (sic), and Sexual Masochism\nand Sadism.\u201d  (GX 7.)  He further found \u201ca defect in judgment, and less so in reliability\nat the time, and it is likely to continue in the future.\u201d  (Id.)\nIn September of 2010, this same Government Psychiatrist, armed with the\nreview of specified records, gave a more thorough Psychological Report.  He reiterated\nhis previous diagnosis, but noted, in part, the following: \u201cThere is no evidence of a\ndefect in judgment, reliability or trustworthiness at work.  When he has sufficient\nduties at work to keep him preoccupied, he feels productive, effective,\nappropriate, and that he is a valued contributor.\u201d  (GX 8 at page 3, emphasis\nsupplied.)\nMost recently, in February of 2012, his current treating psychiatrist, Psychiatrist\nC, opined the following: \u201cThis is to verify that my patient, . . . [the Applicant], does not\nhave a medical condition nor is he receiving medical treatment that impairs his\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness in safe-guarding classified national security\ninformation.\u201d  (AppX A at page 1.)\n\n4\nPersonal Conduct\n3.a.  In February of 2007, another Government Agency denied granting the\nApplicant access to SCI, based on allegations similar to those noted above.  (GX 10 at\npage 12.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nPsychological Conditions\nThe concern under Paragraph 27 is that, \u201cCertain emotional, mental, and\npersonality conditions can impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d  Here, a\nGovernment Psychiatrist saw the Appellant in December of 2008, and made a\ndiagnosis.  The disqualifying condition under Paragraph 28(b) is applicable as there\nappears to be \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the\nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may impair\njudgement, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d  That diagnosis called into question the\nApplicant\u2019s judgement.\nThis is countered, however, by that same Government Psychiatrist\u2019s September\n2010 Psychological Report that found \u201cno evidence of a defect in judgment, reliability or\ntrustworthiness at work.\u201d  Therefore, the mitigating condition under Paragraph 29(c)\nclearly applies, as a \u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional\nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an\nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability\nof recurrence or exacerbation.\u201d  The mitigating condition under Paragraph 29(e) also\nclearly applies, as \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem.\u201d  Here, most recently, the\nApplicant\u2019s treating Psychiatrist opined that the Applicant, \u201cdoes not have a medical\ncondition nor is he receiving medical treatment that impairs his judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness in safe-guarding classified national security information.\u201d\nSexual Behavior\nParagraph 12 sets out the security concern relating to Sexual Behavior.  \u201cSexual\nbehavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder,\nreflects lack of judgement or discretion, or which may subject the individual to undue\ninfluence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nThe disqualifying conditions described by Subparagraphs 13(b) and 13(c) are\narguably applicable here.  Subparagraph 13(b) proscribes \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-\ndestructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to stop or that may be\nsymptomatic of a personality disorder.\u201d  The Applicant has a history of sadomasochistic\nacts.  Subparagraph 13(c) proscribes \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  These disqualifying conditions are\ncountered, however, by Subparagraphs 14(b) and 14(c).  Subparagraph 14(b) finds\nmitigating where \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, . . . that it is unlikely to\n\n6\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  His last act of sadomasochism occurred more than seven years ago,\nand he is administered injections to prevent any future such acts.  Furthermore, under\nSubparagraph 14(c) \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation,\nor duress.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s Security Officer, who testified at his hearing, knows of his\ncondition, and the Applicant\u2019s spouse, who sat through his hearing, is also aware of it.\n(TR at page 41 line 9 to page 52 line 18, at page 84 line 24 to page 25 line 5, and at\npage 85 line 21 to page 86 line 12.)\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas\nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d  Here, the Applicant was denied\naccess to SCI by another Government Agency in 2007.  This is countered, however, by\nSubparagraph 17(c) as \u201cso much time has passed . . . that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d\nSince then, a Government Psychiatrist and his own treating Psychiatrist have deemed\nthe Applicant to be trustworthy.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept.  The Administrative Judge should also consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n7\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Again, the Applicant has the unqualified\nsupport of those who know him in the work place and in the community.  (AppX B.)  The\nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his Psychological Conditions, Sexual\nBehavior and related Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline I:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Joseph Testan, Esquire\nSeptember 10, 2012\n______________\nRemand Decision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on October\n16, 2007.  On February 4, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nI, D and E for the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 15, 2011.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing on March 14, 2011, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on March 17, 2011, and I received\nthe case assignment on January 24, 2012.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJanuary 26, 2012, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 22, 2012.  The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 10, which were received without\n\n2\nobjection.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf, as did his Security Officer, and\nsubmitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through F, which were received without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (TR) on March 7, 2012.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s\nrequests, one made at his hearing and the other one after his hearing, to keep the\nrecord open until April 10, 2012, to submit additional matters, to include a Closing\nArgument.  On March 22, 2012, through Department Counsel, the Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nsubmitted \u201cApplicant\u2019s Closing Argument.\u201d  The record closed on April 10, 2012.  Based\nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation was granted, and a Decision was issued on April 25, 2012.  The\nGovernment appealed this Decision.  \u201cDepartment Counsel raised the following issues\non appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider critical aspects of the record; whether\nthe Judge erred in his application of the mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nwhole-person analysis was erroneous.\u201d  (Appeal Board Decision dated August 17, 2012\n(Decision) at page 1.)\nOn August 17, 2012, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded this case, specifically\nnoting the following:\nThe Judge\u2019s failure to discuss Applicant\u2019s contact with children impaired\nhis analysis of the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.  We\nconclude that the best resolution is to remand the case to the Judge for a\nnew decision.  The other issues raised by Department Counsel are not\nripe for discussion.  (Decision at page 3.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.e. of the SOR, with explanations.  He denied the factual\nallegations in Subparagraphs 1.f.~1.I., 2.a. and 3.a. of the SOR.  He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nPsychological Conditions & Sexual Behavior\nThe Applicant held a security clearance \u201cfrom 1977 to 1985,\u201d and again from\n1995 to 2007.  (TR at page 60 line 17 to page 67 line 10.)  He has never had a security\nviolation.  (Id.)  His Security Officer speaks most highly of the Applicant.  (TR at page 41\nline 9 to page 52 line 18.)  She has known the Applicant for \u201c[a]pproximately five years.\u201d\n(TR at page 43 line 19.)  The following colloquy occurred between her and Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel:\nQ Okay.  So, you\u2019re familiar with the evidence against him here today?\nA Yes, I am.\nQ And the allegations against him?\n\n3\nA Yes.\nQ Based on what you know of . . . [the Applicant] and your experience in\nthe Industry and what NSA - - the position they\u2019ve taken - - what\u2019s your\nopinion about how he\u2019s been treated?\nA I think they have operated on some basis that I just don\u2019t think are(sic)\nsound.  I think it\u2019s a shame that he does not have his Clearance.  I think\nhis Clearance should be reinstated.  Everything that I\u2019ve seen of him says\nhe can handle safeguarding classified information appropriately and is not\na threat to national security in any way, shape or form.  (TR at page 45\nlines 1~21.)\nIn addition, the following colloquy occurred with Department Counsel:\nQ Okay.  You mentioned your daughters who are older now, but assuming\nyou had granddaughters, would you have any hesitation to allow . . . [the\nApplicant] to be alone with your granddaughters?\nA Absolutely not.  He is not - - anything that I\u2019ve seen or read, not a\npedophile.  I just think that\u2019s wrong.  It\u2019s a wrong conclusion.\nQ Do you believe that any of his conduct which he has admitted to would\nin any way compromise his ability to safeguard classified information?\nA Absolutely not.  (TR at page 48 line 23 to page 49 line 11.)\n1.a.~1.i. and 2.a.  The Applicant grew up in what was in many ways a\ndysfunctional family.  He was \u201cthe youngest of three sons\u201d; but in his mother\u2019s eyes, he\n\u201cwas supposed to be a girl.\u201d  (TR at page 65 line 5 to page 67 line 10.)  His mother\ntreated him as she would a daughter.  By age five he was cross-dressing, and by age\neight he began engaging in sadomasochistic acts by injuring himself.  (Id.)  His\nsadomasochistic behavior ceased in about 2004, and his treating Psychiatrist gives the\nApplicant injections of medication to control his obsessive behavior.  (GX 3 at pages\n9~11.)\nIt is also alleged that the Applicant is sexually attracted to young girls, has\nfantasies about inappropriate conduct with young girls, and has sought non-sexual\ncontact with young girls.  (GX 3 at pages 14~15, 17~19 and 22~23.)  The Applicant\nadmits he has sought appropriate, non-sexual, conduct with young girls.  (TR at page\n80 line 14 to page 84 line 9, and GX 10 at pages 4~8.)  However, the Applicant denies\nthat he is sexually attracted to, or has fantasies about inappropriate conduct with, young\ngirls; and avers that the Government polygrapher put words in his mouth.  (TR at page\n80 line 14 to page 84 line 9.)  Based my observations of the Applicant, and on the\nextensive outpouring of support by those who know the Applicant, as evidenced by 14\nletters of support, I find his denials and his testimony to be most credible.  (AppX B.)\n\n4\nFrom 1980~1983, the Applicant saw Psychiatrist A for a condition initially\ndiagnosed as Anxiety Reaction, and later changed to Depressive Neurosis.  (TR at\npage 67 line 11 to page 68 line 18, and GX 3 at page 9.)  He was prescribed medication\nto treat his Depression.  (Id.)  When Psychiatrist A moved, the Applicant saw\nPsychiatrist B, who had purchased Psychiatrist A\u2019s practice.  (TR at page 68 line 19 to\npage 72 line 13.)\nPsychiatrist B saw the Applicant about every two weeks from 1983 until\nPsychiatrist B passed away in 1998.  (Id, and TR at page 72 lines 21~23.)  In October\nof 1995, this treating psychiatrist answered a \u201cMedical Information Questionnaire\u201d\nregarding the Applicant.  (GX 6.)  In part, Psychiatrist B noted that the Applicant was\nsuffering from, \u201cDepression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behavior.\u201d  (GX 6 at\npage 1.)  He found \u201cno immoral or deviant behavior.\u201d  (Id.)  His prognosis was \u201cfair good\nprogress made.\u201d  (GX 6 at page 2.)  He found \u201cno impairment\u201d in judgement or\nreliability.  (Id.)\nSince 1998, the Applicant has seen Psychiatrist C every two weeks \u201cfor\ntreatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.\u201d  (TR at page 72 line 14 to page 75 line\n11, at page 115 line 1 to page 116 line 14, GX 9, and AppX A at pages 3 and 4.)  In\nSeptember of 2009, this treating Psychiatrist noted, in part, the following: \u201cI am satisfied\nwith the current state of therapy.  He has good control of his behavior and is highly\nunlikely to be influenced, coerced, or manipulated because of his fantasies.\u201d  (AppX A at\npage 4.)  In March of 2011, his treating Psychiatrist further noted that the Applicant \u201cis\ntruthful and conscientious and would not permit his private fantasies to interfere with his\nability to protect sensitive government information.\u201d\nHowever, in December of 2008, the Applicant met with a Government\nPsychologist for an hour; and based on that meeting and a review of unspecified\nrecords, he found a \u201cDSM IV diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Major\nDepression, recurrent, Pedophilia, Transvestic Festishism (sic), and Sexual Masochism\nand Sadism.\u201d  (GX 7.)  He further found \u201ca defect in judgment, and less so in reliability\nat the time, and it is likely to continue in the future.\u201d  (Id.)\nIn September of 2010, this same Government Psychologist, armed with the\nreview of specified records, gave a more thorough Psychological Report.  He reiterated\nhis previous diagnosis, but noted, in part, the following: \u201cThere is no evidence of a\ndefect in judgment, reliability or trustworthiness at work.  When he has sufficient duties\nat work to keep him preoccupied, he feels productive, effective, appropriate, and that he\nis a valued contributor.\u201d  (GX 8 at page 3.)\nMost recently, in February of 2012, his current treating Psychiatrist,\nPsychiatrist C, opined the following: \u201cThis is to verify that my patient, . . . [the\nApplicant], does not have a medical condition nor is he receiving medical treatment that\nimpairs his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness in safe-guarding classified national\nsecurity information.\u201d  (AppX A at page 1.)\n\n5\nPersonal Conduct\n3.a.  In February of 2007, another Government Agency denied the Applicant\naccess to SCI, based on allegations similar to those noted above.  (GX 10 at page 12.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nPsychological Conditions\nThe concern under Paragraph 27 is that, \u201cCertain emotional, mental, and\npersonality conditions can impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d  Here, a\nGovernment Psychologist saw the Appellant in December of 2008, and made a\ndiagnosis.  The disqualifying condition under Paragraph 28(b) is applicable as there\nappears to be \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the\nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may impair\njudgement, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d  That diagnosis called into question the\nApplicant\u2019s judgement.\nThis is countered, however, by the opinion of his treating Psychiatrist, who has\nseen the Applicant every two weeks for the last 14 years.  The mitigating condition\nunder Paragraph 29(e) clearly applies, as \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem.\u201d\nHere, most recently, the Applicant\u2019s treating Psychiatrist opined that the Applicant,\n\u201cdoes not have a medical condition nor is he receiving medical treatment that impairs\nhis judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness in safe-guarding classified national security\ninformation.\u201d\nSexual Behavior\nParagraph 12 sets out the security concern relating to Sexual Behavior.  \u201cSexual\nbehavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder,\nreflects lack of judgement or discretion, or which may subject the individual to undue\ninfluence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nThe disqualifying conditions described by Subparagraphs 13(b) and 13(c) are\narguably applicable here.  Subparagraph 13(b) proscribes \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-\ndestructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to stop or that may be\nsymptomatic of a personality disorder.\u201d  The Applicant has a history of sadomasochistic\nacts.  Subparagraph 13(c) proscribes \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  These disqualifying conditions are\ncountered, however, by Subparagraphs 14(b) and 14(c).  Subparagraph 14(b) finds\nmitigating where \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, . . . that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  His last act of sadomasochism occurred more than seven years ago,\nand he is administered injections to prevent any future such acts.  Furthermore, under\nSubparagraph 14(c) \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation,\n\n7\nor duress.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s Security Officer, who testified at his hearing, knows of his\ncondition, and the Applicant\u2019s spouse, who sat through his hearing, is also aware of it.\n(TR at page 41 line 9 to page 52 line 18, at page 84 line 24 to page 25 line 5, and at\npage 85 line 21 to page 86 line 12.)\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas\nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d  Here, the Applicant was denied\naccess to SCI by another Government Agency in 2007.  This is countered, however, by\nSubparagraph 17(c) as \u201cso much time has passed . . . that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d\nSince then, his treating Psychiatrist has deemed the Applicant to be trustworthy.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept.  The Administrative Judge should also consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n8\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Again, the Applicant has the unqualified\nsupport of those who know him in the work place and in the community.  (AppX B.)  The\nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his Psychological Conditions, Sexual\nBehavior and related Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline I:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Subparagraphs 1.a.~1.e. of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in Subparagraphs 1.f.~1.I., 2.a. and 3.a. of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. The Appeal Board correctly notes that \u201c[t]he witness . . . offered a medical opinion that she was not qualified to 1 make.\u201d (Decision 2 in Footnote 1 at page 4.) This is correct, but as she was responding to a question by Department Counsel, and as Department Counsel did not ask me to disregard that part of her testimony, it is part of the record. It is her opinion, but clearly not the opinion of an expert witness. 3 Psychological Conditions & Sexual Behavior The Applicant held a security clearance \u201cfrom 1977 to 1985,\u201d and again from 1995 to 2007. (TR at page 60 line 17 to page 67 line 10.) He has never had a security violation. (Id.) His Security Officer speaks most highly of the Applicant. (TR at page 41 line 9 to page 52 line 18.)

On February 4, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nI, D and E for the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 15, 2011.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing on March 14, 2011, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on March 17, 2011, and I received\nthe case assignment on January 24, 2012.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJanuary 26, 2012, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 22, 2012.  The\n\n2\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 10, which were received without\nobjection.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf, as did his Security Officer, and\nsubmitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through F, which were received without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (TR) on March 7, 2012.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s\nrequests, one made at his hearing and the other one after his hearing, to keep the\nrecord open until April 10, 2012, to submit additional matters, to include a Closing\nArgument.  On March 22, 2012, through Department Counsel, the Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nsubmitted \u201cApplicant\u2019s Closing Argument.\u201d  The record closed on April 10, 2012.  Based\nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation was granted, and a Decision was issued on April 25, 2012.  The\nGovernment appealed this Decision.  \u201cDepartment Counsel raised the following issues\non appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider critical aspects of the record; whether\nthe Judge erred in his application of the mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nwhole-person analysis was erroneous.\u201d  (Appeal Board Decision dated August 17, 2012\n(Decision 1) at page 1.)\nOn August 17, 2012, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded this case, specifically\nnoting the following:\nThe Judge\u2019s failure to discuss Applicant\u2019s contact with children impaired\nhis analysis of the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.  We\nconclude that the best resolution is to remand the case to the Judge for a\nnew decision.  The other issues raised by Department Counsel are not\nripe for discussion.  (Decision 1 at page 3.)\nOn September 10, 2012, I issued a Remand Decision, addressing the Appeal\nBoard\u2019s above noted concerns, again granting the Applicant access to classified\ninformation.  However, on December 5, 2012, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded this\ncase (Decision 2), with further instructions.  (Decision 2 at pages 3~8).  The Appeal\nBoard notes the following:\nThe main thrust of Department Counsel\u2019s arguments on appeal is that,\nafter remand, the Judge\u2019s considerations and analysis of the issue of\nApplicant\u2019s thoughts and interactions with young girls remains both\nerroneous and inadequate.  Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s\nfailure to properly address this issue affected his overall analysis of the\ncase under the multiple Adjudicative Guidelines [I, D and E] set forth in the\nSOR.  The Board agrees.  (Decision 2 at page 3, emphasis supplied.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.e. of the SOR, with explanations.  He denied the factual\nallegations in Subparagraphs 1.f.~1.I., 2.a. and 3.a. of the SOR.  He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\n\nThe Appeal Board correctly notes that \u201c[t]he witness . . . offered a medical opinion that she was not qualified to\n1\nmake.\u201d  (Decision 2 in Footnote 1 at page 4.)  This is correct, but as she was responding to a question by Department\nCounsel, and as Department Counsel did not ask me to disregard that part of her testimony, it is part of the record.  It\nis her opinion, but clearly not the opinion of an expert witness.\n3\nPsychological Conditions & Sexual Behavior\nThe Applicant held a security clearance \u201cfrom 1977 to 1985,\u201d and again from\n1995 to 2007.  (TR at page 60 line 17 to page 67 line 10.)  He has never had a security\nviolation.  (Id.)  His Security Officer speaks most highly of the Applicant.  (TR at page 41\nline 9 to page 52 line 18.)  She has known the Applicant for \u201c[a]pproximately five years.\u201d\n(TR at page 43 line 19.)  The following colloquy occurred between her and Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel:\nQ Okay.  So, you\u2019re familiar with the evidence against him here today?\nA Yes, I am.\nQ And the allegations against him?\nA Yes.\nQ Based on what you know of . . . [the Applicant] and your experience in\nthe Industry and what NSA - - the position they\u2019ve taken - - what\u2019s your\nopinion about how he\u2019s been treated?\nA I think they have operated on some basis that I just don\u2019t think are(sic)\nsound.  I think it\u2019s a shame that he does not have his Clearance.  I think\nhis Clearance should be reinstated.  Everything that I\u2019ve seen of him says\nhe can handle safeguarding classified information appropriately and is not\na threat to national security in any way, shape or form.  (TR at page 45\nlines 1~21.)\nIn addition, the following colloquy occurred with Department Counsel:\nQ Okay.  You mentioned your daughters who are older now, but assuming\nyou had granddaughters, would you have any hesitation to allow . . . [the\nApplicant] to be alone with your granddaughters?\nA Absolutely not.  He is not - - anything that I\u2019ve seen or read, not a\npedophile .  I just think that\u2019s wrong.  It\u2019s a wrong conclusion.\n1\nQ Do you believe that any of his conduct which he has admitted to would\nin any way compromise his ability to safeguard classified information?\nA Absolutely not.  (TR at page 48 line 23 to page 49 line 11.)\n\n4\n1.a.~1.i. and 2.a.  The Applicant grew up in what was in many ways a\ndysfunctional family.  He was \u201cthe youngest of three sons\u201d; but in his mother\u2019s eyes, he\n\u201cwas supposed to be a girl.\u201d  (TR at page 65 line 5 to page 67 line 10.)  His mother\ntreated him as she would a daughter.  By age five he was cross-dressing, and by age\neight he began engaging in sadomasochistic acts by injuring himself.  (Id.)  His\nsadomasochistic behavior ceased in about 2004, and his treating Psychiatrist gives the\nApplicant injections of medication to control his obsessive behavior.  (GX 3 at pages\n9~11.)\nIt is also alleged that the Applicant is sexually attracted to young girls, has\nfantasies about inappropriate conduct with young girls, and has sought non-sexual\ncontact with young girls.  (GX 3 at pages 14~15, 17~19 and 22~23.)  The Applicant\nadmits he has sought what he avers to be appropriate, non-sexual, conduct with young\ngirls.  (TR at page 80 line 14 to page 84 line 9, and GX 10 at pages 4~8.)  However, the\nApplicant denies that he is sexually attracted to, or has fantasies about inappropriate\nconduct with, young girls.  (TR at page 80 line 14 to page 84 line 9.)\nThe Appeal Board finds that \u201csetting aside the issue of whether or not Applicant\u2019s\nattraction to and contact with young girls had a sexual component, given the record\nevidence . . . , the Board concludes that the record provides no basis for any reasonable\nperson to view Applicant\u2019s interactions with young girls as appropriate conduct.\u201d\n(Decision 2 at page 6.)  As the Appeal Board ordered that I \u201cissue a new Decision\nconsistent with the analysis contained herein\u201d (Decision 2 at page 8), I find that the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct, delineated at length in the Appeal Board\u2019s Decision (Decision 2 at\npages 5~6), to be inappropriate.\nFrom 1980~1983, the Applicant saw Psychiatrist A for a condition initially\ndiagnosed as Anxiety Reaction, and later changed to Depressive Neurosis.  (TR at\npage 67 line 11 to page 68 line 18, and GX 3 at page 9.)  He was prescribed medication\nto treat his Depression.  (Id.)  When Psychiatrist A moved, the Applicant saw\nPsychiatrist B, who had purchased Psychiatrist A\u2019s practice.  (TR at page 68 line 19 to\npage 72 line 13.)\nPsychiatrist B saw the Applicant about every two weeks from 1983 until\nPsychiatrist B passed away in 1998.  (Id, and TR at page 72 lines 21~23.)  In October\nof 1995, this treating psychiatrist answered a \u201cMedical Information Questionnaire\u201d\nregarding the Applicant.  (GX 6.)  In part, Psychiatrist B noted that the Applicant was\nsuffering from, \u201cDepression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behavior.\u201d  (GX 6 at\npage 1.)  He found \u201cno immoral or deviant behavior.\u201d  (Id.)  His prognosis was \u201cfair good\nprogress made.\u201d  (GX 6 at page 2.)  He found \u201cno impairment\u201d in judgement or\nreliability.  (Id.)\nSince 1998, the Applicant has seen Psychiatrist C every two weeks \u201cfor\ntreatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.\u201d  (TR at page 72 line 14 to page 75 line\n11, at page 115 line 1 to page 116 line 14, GX 9, and AppX A at pages 3 and 4.)  In\nSeptember of 2009, this treating Psychiatrist noted, in part, the following: \u201cI am satisfied\n\n5\nwith the current state of therapy.  He has good control of his behavior and is highly\nunlikely to be influenced, coerced, or manipulated because of his fantasies.\u201d  (AppX A at\npage 4.)  In March of 2011, his treating Psychiatrist further noted that the Applicant \u201cis\ntruthful and conscientious and would not permit his private fantasies to interfere with his\nability to protect sensitive government information.\u201d\nHowever, in December of 2008, the Applicant met with a Government\nPsychologist for an hour; and based on that meeting and a review of unspecified\nrecords, he found a \u201cDSM IV diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Major\nDepression, recurrent, Pedophilia, Transvestic Festishism (sic), and Sexual Masochism\nand Sadism.\u201d  (GX 7.)  He further found \u201ca defect in judgment, and less so in reliability\nat the time, and it is likely to continue in the future.\u201d  (Id.)\nIn September of 2010, this same Government Psychologist, armed with the\nreview of specified records, gave a more thorough Psychological Report.  He reiterated\nhis previous diagnosis, but noted, in part, the following: \u201cThere is no evidence of a\ndefect in judgment, reliability or trustworthiness at work.  When he has sufficient duties\nat work to keep him preoccupied, he feels productive, effective, appropriate, and that he\nis a valued contributor.\u201d  (GX 8 at page 3.)\nMost recently, in February of 2012, his current treating Psychiatrist,\nPsychiatrist C, opined the following: \u201cThis is to verify that my patient, . . . [the\nApplicant], does not have a medical condition nor is he receiving medical treatment that\nimpairs his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness in safe-guarding classified national\nsecurity information.\u201d  (AppX A at page 1.)\nPersonal Conduct\n3.a.  In February of 2007, another Government Agency denied the Applicant\naccess to SCI, based on allegations similar to those noted above; i.e., Psychological\nConditions, Sexual Behavior, and Personal Conduct.  (GX 10 at pages 3~12.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\n\n6\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nPsychological Conditions\nThe concern under Paragraph 27 is that, \u201cCertain emotional, mental, and\npersonality conditions can impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d  Here, a\nGovernment Psychologist saw the Appellant in December of 2008, and made a\ndiagnosis.  The disqualifying condition under Paragraph 28(b) is applicable as there\nappears to be \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the\nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may impair\njudgement, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d  That diagnosis called into question the\nApplicant\u2019s judgement.\n\n7\nThis is countered, however, by the opinion of his treating Psychiatrist, who has\nseen the Applicant every two weeks for the last 14 years.  The mitigating condition\nunder Paragraph 29(e) clearly applies, as \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem.\u201d\nHere, most recently, the Applicant\u2019s treating Psychiatrist opined that the Applicant,\n\u201cdoes not have a medical condition nor is he receiving medical treatment that impairs\nhis judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness in safe-guarding classified national security\ninformation.\u201d\nSexual Behavior\nParagraph 12 sets out the security concern relating to Sexual Behavior.  \u201cSexual\nbehavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder,\nreflects lack of judgement or discretion, or which may subject the individual to undue\ninfluence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nThe disqualifying conditions described by Subparagraphs 13(b) and 13(c) are\narguably applicable here.  Subparagraph 13(b) proscribes \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-\ndestructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to stop or that may be\nsymptomatic of a personality disorder.\u201d  The Applicant has a history of sadomasochistic\nacts, which involve self harm.  Subparagraph 13(c) proscribes \u201csexual behavior that\ncauses an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  These\ndisqualifying conditions are countered, however, by Subparagraphs 14(b) and 14(c).\nSubparagraph 14(b) finds it mitigating where \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long\nago, . . . that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  His last act of sadomasochism occurred\nmore than seven years ago, and he is administered injections to prevent any future\nsuch acts.  Furthermore, under Subparagraph 14(c) \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a\nbasis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s Security Officer, who\ntestified at his hearing, knows of his condition, and the Applicant\u2019s spouse, who sat\nthrough his hearing, is also aware of it.  (TR at page 41 line 9 to page 52 line 18, at\npage 84 line 24 to page 25 line 5, and at page 85 line 21 to page 86 line 12.)\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas\nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\n\n8\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d  Here, the Applicant has engaged in\ninappropriate conduct, vis-a-vis young girls, on numerous occasions.  I can find no\ncountervailing mitigating condition that is applicable, here.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept.  The Administrative Judge should also consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Although the Applicant has the unqualified\nsupport of those who know him in the work place and in the community (AppX B), I\ncannot ignore his numerous acts of inappropriate conduct.  The record evidence leaves\nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline I:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 14, 2008 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under SOR subparagraphs 1(a), (c-e), (g-h), (jj) and under Guidelines J and\n1\nE is not at issue in this appeal.  \n2\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nSeptember 16, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts.  He found that some of the\ndebts alleged in the SOR were apparently duplicates of others.  Additionally, he decided in favor of\nApplicant on debts that Applicant demonstrated he had actually paid off.  However, the Judge\nreasonably concluded that, even discounting these matters, Applicant still had at least $26,471 in\ndelinquent debt.  After examining the possible application of pertinent mitigating conditions, the\nJudge concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated sufficient mitigation of his financial situation\nto support a favorable security clearance adjudication.  The Judge\u2019s decision, viewed in light of the\nrecord as a whole, draws a rational connection between the facts found and its ultimate denial of a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See\nalso Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn June 28, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance for his employment\nwith a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On February 14, 2008, DOHA issued\nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n Gx. 9 was admitted over Applicant\u2019s objection. (Tr. 41 - 43)\n3\n2\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial\n2\nconsiderations), Guideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on May 27, 2008, and I convened a hearing on June 18, 2008. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented 14 substantive exhibits (Gx.\n1 - 14)  and one demonstrative exhibit (Jx. I). Applicant testified in his own behalf, and\n3\noffered three exhibits admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - C. I\nalso left the record open to receive a post-hearing submission from Applicant. On June\n19, 2008, Applicant submitted an 18-page exhibit via Department Counsel, who had no\nobjection to its admission. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission was\nincluded in the record as Ax. D. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 26, 2008.\nProcedural Issues\n1. As to Guideline F, the government initially alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.oo that\nApplicant owed approximately $39,878 for 41 delinquent debts. On April 21, 2008,\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by proposing to strike SOR \u00b6 1.hh as a\nduplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.u, and by striking SOR \u00b6 1.z as a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.mm. The\nmotion also proposed amending the SOR to add under SOR \u00b6 1, four new allegations of\ndebt as follows:\n\u201cpp. You are indebted to The Center for Orthopedics for a judgment against you\nin the approximate amount of $8,419. As of April 17, 2008, this debt had not\nbeen paid.\nqq. You are indebted to VA Heartland Bank for a judgment against you in the\napproximate amount of $2,045. As of April 17, 2008, this debt had not been paid.\nrr. You are indebted to Sport & Health Company LC for a judgment against you in\nthe approximate amount of $425. As of April 17, 2008, this debt had not been\npaid.\nss. You are indebted to Fred Ambulatory Surgery Center for a judgment against\nyou in the approximate amount of $1,236. As of April 17, 2008, this debt had not\nbeen paid.\u201d\nApplicant timely responded to Department Counsel\u2019s motion and made no\nobjection to it. (Tr. 15 - 16) Accordingly, as amended, the SOR alleges 43 unpaid and\npast due debts: one for an unpaid municipal tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.a), 14 debts being\n\n3\nenforced through civil judgment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.k, 1.pp - 1.ss), 26 debts referred to\ncollection agencies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l - 1.y, 1.aa - 1.gg, 1.ii -  1.mm), and two for unpaid\ntelephone accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.nn and 1.oo). The total debt alleged in the SOR, as\namended, was approximately $43,008.\n2. As to Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was arrested in November 2006\nand charged with felonious assault (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he was arrested in June 2002 and\ncharged with assault and battery (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that he was arrested in August 2002 and\ncharged with violating a protective order and with assault and battery (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and\nthat he violated the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by deliberately falsifying answers to\nquestions in his June 2007 SF-86 (SOR \u00b6 2.d).\nAs to Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant deliberately falsified answers to\nquestions in his June 2007 e-QIP. Specifically, it was alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a that he\ndeliberately failed to list any of his arrests when he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 23a. -\n23.e (Your Police Record). In SOR \u00b6 3.b, it was alleged that, by answering \u201cno\u201d to e-QIP\nquestion 23.a, he deliberately failed to disclose that he had been charged with the\nfelony offense listed in SOR \u00b6 2.a.\nHowever, as drafted, the last sentence of SOR \u00b6 3.b stated \u201cYou deliberately\nfailed to disclose the allegations as set out in subparagraph 1.a.\u201d (emphasis added) In\naccordance with \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, I  amended SOR \u00b6 3.b sua sponte to\nconform to the evidence introduced at hearing. Accordingly, the last sentence of SOR\n3.b now reads as follows: \u201cYou deliberately failed to disclose the allegations as set out\nin subparagraph 2.a.\u201d (emphasis added) \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c - 1.e,\n1.g, 1.h, 1.m, 1.v, and 1.y, but explained those debts had either been paid or that\narrangements were being made with the creditors to satisfy the debts. He also admitted\nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.I, 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, 1.p, 1.u, 1.aa - 1.gg, and 1.jj - 1.nn, but\nexplained he was resolving those debts through a debt consolidation plan. Applicant\nalso admitted, without explanation, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.pp - 1.ss. (Tr. 15)\nApplicant denied owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.w, and 1.x. As to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n1.f, 1.n, 1.q - 1.t, and 1.ii, Applicant did not deny or admit owing the debts alleged. (Tr.\n14)\nUnder Guidelines J and E, Applicant responded to the allegations by stating, \u201cI\ndo not Deny and (sic) admit my arrests. I was not guilty in these charges.\u201d He then\nprovided a brief explanation of the events alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.c. At hearing,\nApplicant acknowledged he had been arrested as alleged. (Tr. 16 - 18) But Applicant\ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b that he had deliberately made false\nstatements to the government when he omitted from his security clearance application\nhis arrests in November 2000, June 2002, and August 2002. He did not respond to the\nallegation in SOR \u00b6 2.d that his alleged false statements to the government constitute\ncriminal conduct as violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. However, by his denial of the SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b allegations, he effectively denied the SOR \u00b6 2.d allegation. (Tr. 16 - 17)\n\n4\nIn addition to the facts admitted through his response to the SOR, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact based on my review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor from April 2007 until April 2008,\nwhen he was hired for a significant pay increase by another defense contractor.\nHowever, when it became clear the adjudication of his request for clearance submitted\nin June 2007 was not yet complete, he was laid off. Nonetheless, his employer stated in\nwriting that Applicant will be re-hired if he obtains his clearance. That letter is included in\nthe record as Jx. 11. He currently works as a civilian federal employee of one of the\nmilitary services and has submitted another request for clearance in connection with\nthat job. (Tr. 4 - 9) \nApplicant is 31 years old and has worked in the information technology (IT)\nindustry since about 1996. More specifically, he currently works as an information\nsecurity specialist. After graduating high school in 1995, he attended a technical school\nfor about two years before finding work as an IT consultant and network field engineer.\nIn about 1997, he started doing IT work on his own, and by 1999 had started his own\ncompany. He had no direct-hire employees working for him, but paid other independent\nconsultants to do some of the work called for in his contracts with various customers.\nBetween 2000 and 2002, Applicant\u2019s business experienced a downturn and he stopped\nusing the services of those contractors, whose income Applicant reported to the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) using Form 1099. The other contractors were responsible for\nreporting their income and paying their own taxes. (Tr. 145) One of the contractors filed\nfor unemployment benefits to which Applicant insisted she was not entitled; however, a\njudgment was entered against Applicant to enforce a $528 tax debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.a)\nApplicant paid that judgment in September 2003. After his business failed, he continued\nto find work on his own as an IT consultant to several customers at once. (Tr. 74, 147)\nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s business problems, he fell behind on several financial\nobligations. He failed to pay several parking tickets and property tax bills for which\njudgments were obtained against him. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.e, 1.g, 1,h) Applicant also had\ntax and other financial problems as a result of poor or ineffective tax filing and\naccounting practices. (Tr. 145) He paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h in\nDecember 2006. He paid the SOR \u00b6 1.c debt the day of his hearing. (Ax. D) \nApplicant also carried no medical coverage between 1999 and 2007. A previous\nemployer revoked his medical benefits apparently in reprisal for Applicant\u2019s decision to\nseek out his own business. As a result, when Applicant hurt his knee around that time,\nhe had no insurance with which to cover the costs of treatment and surgery. (Tr. 142 -\n144) Applicant had a second knee surgery in 2007, and was hospitalized in October\n2007 when he developed an infection after surgery. (Tr. 60; Ax. B) While it appears he\nhad medical insurance coverage for his second surgery through his defense contractor\nemployer, his lack of coverage before 2007 resulted in several medical bills he could not\npay. Those debts were reduced to civil judgments or referred to collection agencies\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.q - 1.u, 1.cc - 1.gg, 1.mm, 1.pp, and 1.ss) which remain unpaid. (Gx. 3;\nGx. 9; Tr. 109)\n\n SOR 1.jj is a duplicate of the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.ii (Tr. 84) \n4\n5\nApplicant also struggled to pay other personal obligations such as car loans. He\nhas had four cars repossessed since 1997 and still owes Ford Motor Credit Company\n$3,956 for the remainder after resale of a vehicle he returned to the dealer. (SOR \u00b6 1.I;\nGx. 3) He also owes $4,000 for the balance of a loan on a vehicle he had under-insured\nwhen it was totaled in a car accident. (SOR \u00b6 1.ii;  Gx. 3; Tr. 82 - 84) Applicant also still\n4\nowes $2,000 for the remainder after re-sale of another vehicle that was involuntarily\nrepossessed in 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.qq; Gx. 12; Tr. 100 - 101). None of these debts has\nbeen paid.\nApplicant also owes three debts to a cable TV company for failing to return cable\nboxes or pay for services when he moved in 2005. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.w, 1.x, and 1.bb)\nApplicant claimed he has paid these debts but was unable to present any\ndocumentation to support his claim. (Tr. 80 - 81) \nApplicant has disputed an $8,000 debt attributed to him resulting from a\ndisagreement about changes to a lease for his residence in 2004 and 2005. The debt\nwas reduced to a civil judgment in 2005, which has not yet been paid. (Gx. 3; Tr. 88 -\n92) He also owes several unpaid debts for utilities from around the same time for phone\nservice accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.t, 1.v, 1.aa, 1.kk, 1nn, 1.oo), electricity (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.p), and satellite TV service (SOR \u00b6 1.ll). None of the debts has been paid.\n(Gx. 3; Gx. 9)\nApplicant also owes an unpaid bill for veterinary services (SOR \u00b6 1.y), which was\nplaced for collection in 2003. This debt has not been paid. (Gx. 12) Nor has he satisfied\na judgment on a debt for $425 owed to a physical fitness center. (SOR 1.rr) Applicant\ndisputes that debt, claiming he cancelled his membership in 2005 or 2006 but the\ncompany kept charging him. (Tr. 166 - 167)\nApplicant has never been married, but has sole custody of his four-year-old child.\nHe won custody through legal proceedings, but has been unable to pay for his legal\nfees. His attorney referred the matter to a collection agency to recoup $4,391 in unpaid\nfees (SOR \u00b6 1.k), but the debt remains unpaid.\nIn March 2008, Applicant enlisted the services of a legal services and debt\nconsolidation firm to both negotiate on his behalf with his creditors and to consolidate\npayments of his outstanding personal debts. He has been paying approximately $394\neach month into a fund that will be used to pay down his debts based on settlements\nnegotiated by the firm. To date, no payments have actually been made to his creditors\nfrom the fund. (Attachments to Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR; Ax. A; Tr. 156 - 160;\nAx. D)\nApplicant has been arrested three times. (Gx. 10) In November 2000, Applicant\nwas working as a doorman/bouncer at a local bar. One evening, he had to remove\nseveral patrons who were drunk and unruly. They, in turn, attacked him and he\ndefended himself. The patron later swore a warrant against Applicant, who was arrested\n\n Applicant asserted at hearing he had as much as $500 left each month after expenses, but he did not explain\n5\nthe basis for his claim. (Tr. 114)\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n6\nand charged with felonious assault. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) The charges were eventually dismissed\nand Applicant agreed to help with the complainant\u2019s medical costs. In June 2002,\nApplicant was arrested and charged with simple assault and battery after a domestic\nargument with his then-girlfriend, who also obtained a protective order against him.\n(SOR \u00b6 2.b) The assault charge was later dismissed, but the protective order remained\nin place. Two months later, Applicant got into a fight with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s new\nboyfriend and was charged with violating a protective order and simple assault and\nbattery. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) The assault charge was dismissed, but he was convicted of\nviolating the protective order, a misdemeanor offense. Applicant was ordered to have no\ncontact with his ex-girlfriend for three years. (Tr. 123 - 127)\nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in June 2007, he answered \u201cno\u201d in response\nto questions under e-QIP section 23. Those questions asked if he had been arrested,\ncharged or convicted of a firearms or explosives offense (23.b) or any offense related to\ndrugs or alcohol (23.c), or, in the preceding seven years, any other offense, including\nviolations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (23.d and 23.e). By his answers, he\nomitted his two arrests in 2002 and 2002. (SOR \u00b6 3.a) Further, by answering \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 23.a, which asked if he had ever been arrested, charged or convicted of a\nfelony offense, he omitted his arrest for felonious assault in 2000. (SOR \u00b6 3.b) Applicant\ncontended he thought he only had to list those offenses for which he was actually\nconvicted. He also averred he was careless in reading the questions and may not have\nunderstood them. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 72, 130 - 134) As to his misdemeanor conviction\nfor violating a protective order, he testified he did not realize he had been convicted and\nthat he thought the court\u2019s only action was to order him to stay away from his ex-\ngirlfriend. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 127 - 129)\nApplicant\u2019s current income is steady, especially when compared to the irregular\nnature of his work as an independent consultant before April 2007. When he was hired\nby his previous defense contractor employer, he earned about $55,000. When hired by\nanother defense contractor, his annual salary increased to about $85,000. (Tr. 148 -\n149) In his current job, Applicant is paid about $3,500 after taxes each month. He also\nreceives $300 each month in child support from the child\u2019s mother. After deducting\nexpenses, including the monthly payments to his debt consolidation plan, he realizes\nabout $200 left over each month. (Tr. 110 - 113)5\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n6\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n7\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations), at AG \u00b6 18, Guideline E (personal conduct) at AG\n\u00b6 15, and Guideline J (criminal conduct) at AG \u00b6 30.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n8\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.9\n\n8\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s arrest record, as stated in \u00b6 AG 30, is:\n[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nIt was alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d that he violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by intentionally\nmaking false statements to the government through his e-QIP responses. For reasons\nstated in the discussion of his Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6 3, below), the government\u2019s\ninformation was insufficient to support this allegation. However, Department Counsel\npresented sufficient information to show Applicant was arrested and charged with\ncriminal offenses on three occasions between 2000 and 2002. Applicant was actually\nconvicted of one misdemeanor offense, but available information, including his\ntestimony, supports that he did engage in some of the criminal conduct alleged in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.c. Accordingly, the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted) apply.\nBy contrast, the record also supports application of the mitigating conditions at\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(evidence that the person did not commit the offense), and AG \u00b6 31(d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement). It has\nbeen more than five years since Applicant was involved in any criminal activity, all but\none of the charges were dismissed, and his circumstances have changed significantly\nsince he was a bouncer or was involved with the girlfriend with whom he was having\ntrouble at the time. Additionally, his lifestyle as a single father, and his recent\nemployment stability support a conclusion he is unlikely to repeat his past behaviors. On\nbalance, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns about his past criminal conduct.\nPersonal Conduct.\nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct may be a security concern because, as stated in\nAG \u00b6 15, is that \n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\n\n See, AG \u00b616(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\n10\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance  eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities).\n9\nThe government\u2019s information shows he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions about his\narrest record, thus omitting his arrests in 2000 and 2002. Gx. 1 reflects he answered the\nquestions as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.1 and 3.b; however, to be disqualifying, it must be\nshown Applicant knowingly intended it as a false answer so as to mislead the\ngovernment by concealing his financial problems.  Because Applicant denied the\n10\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b, the government bore the burden of \u201cpresenting\nwitnesses and other evidence to establish facts that have been controverted.\u201d\n(Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.14) Other than the e-QIP, the government\u2019s case\nin this regard consisted solely of the Applicant\u2019s testimony. Applicant\u2019s explanation\nabout his belief he was not actually convicted of a misdemeanor charge in 2002 and\nthat he was required to list only those charges for which he was convicted was credible.\nAbsent any more direct evidence from the government about Applicant\u2019s intent at the\ntime he completed his e-QIP, Applicant\u2019s explanation was sufficient to refute the SOR \u00b6\n3 allegations. Accordingly, I conclude this guideline for the Applicant. \nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the allegations\nin the SOR, as amended. However, SOR 1.jj appears to be a duplicate of the $7,109\ndebt listed at SOR 1.ii and is resolved for the Applicant. Further, Applicant has paid the\ndebts listed in SOR 1.a, 1.c - 1.e, 1.g and 1.h, which total $1,360. He also disputed the\n$8,068 debt listed in SOR 1.j. Even after subtracting these debts from the total alleged\nin SOR 1, Applicant owes at least $26,471 in unpaid debts he has accumulated since\n1997. Given the absence of information that might document his dispute with the SOR\n1.j creditor, it is more likely that he owes about $34,539. Accordingly, available\ninformation requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations).\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant established that his\nfinancial problems have been caused, at least in part, by the vagaries of his self-\nemployment status since 1997. He had no medical insurance and was subject to\nunforeseen circumstances that led to business downturns and inconsistent income.\nHowever, the record also shows Applicant\u2019s own decision making (lack of incorporation,\n\n10\nfailure to properly insure himself and his vehicles, and poor tax reporting and accounting\npractices) exacerbated his business problems. To his credit, he paid five of his six tax\nand other municipal debts in 2003 and 2006, and to further correct his problems,\nApplicant enlisted the services of a firm to set up a consolidation and repayment plan,\ninto which he has been paying his money each month since March 2008. \nHowever, that firm has not yet paid anything toward his obligations. The fact his\ncorrective efforts were delayed by his hospitalization in October 2007 is insignificant\nwhen compared with the fact he has repeatedly failed to meet his financial obligations or\ntry to correct his approach to his finances over the preceding 10 years. Aside from the\nreceipts in Ax. B and D, which show he has paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c - 1.e, 1.g and 1.h\nApplicant provided no information to support his claimed disputes with creditors or of\nother debt payments. \nThe facts presented here raise security concerns that might be mitigated if he\ncould show his debt problems \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(a)). Because\nApplicant\u2019s debts remain largely unaddressed and have existed for more than 10 years,\nthis mitigating condition does not apply. \nMitigation may also be found if Applicant\u2019s debts arose from circumstances\n\u201clargely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances).\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) There is some merit in\nApplicant\u2019s claim his financial problems were caused by his business problems;\nhowever, it is clear from this record that Applicant did not exercise sound judgment in\nhis financial matters and that he did not act in a prudent manner to resolve his financial\ncondition over several years. This mitigating condition does not apply. \nLikewise, the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control), and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) do not apply.\nApplicant\u2019s debt consolidation and repayment plan may eventually bear fruit, but as\npresented, it does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his finances. Further,\nApplicant has not established he has corrected the management of his finances\nsufficiently to preclude future problems that might again raise security concerns. Nor\ndoes the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue) apply. Applicant\u2019s claims regarding his disputes with the\ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.rr, while plausible, are uncorroborated and the judgments\nagainst him for those debts have stood for several years without action by him to\nresolve them. On balance, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about his\nfinances.\n\n See footnote 6, supra.\n11\n See footnote 9, supra. \n12\n11\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E, F, and J. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 31\nyears old and has spent most of his adult life in business for himself. He is a bright,\nhard-working individual who is completely dedicated to the care of his young child and\nto advancing his professional career. However, the favorable information in his\nbackground is insufficient to overcome the security concerns about his lengthy history of\nbad debt and poor judgment related thereto. The facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s\nfinances present an unacceptable risk to the national interest were he to be granted\naccess to classified information. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n11\ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows there are still doubts about his ability\nor willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of\nthe national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be\nresolved in favor of the national interest.12\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c - 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g - 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I - 1.ii:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.jj:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.kk - 1.ss:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.d\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a - 3.b\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 24, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 21, 2008, and waived her \nright to a hearing before an administrative judge. On April 16, 2008, she withdrew her \nwaiver and requested a hearing.  On April 21, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to me \nand issued a Notice of Hearing on May 7, 2008. The case was heard on May 29, 2008, \nas scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through F into evidence \nwithout objection.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until June 13, \n2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On June 12, \n2008, she submitted four additional exhibits that I marked as AE G through J and \nadmitted into the record without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 11, 2008.  On June 26, 2008, Department Counsel notified me that Applicant \ninformed him that she recently remarried and that the bankruptcy court entered a \ndischarge order on June 24, 2008.  On July 8, 2008, I received the four additional \ndocuments that I marked as AE K through N and entered into the record without \nobjection from Department Counsel.                                                    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.r of the SOR and provided additional information in support of her \nrequest for a security clearance. Her admissions are incorporated into the following \nfindings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. She has two children, ages 20 and 23, from her first \nmarriage that ended in 1989 after six years. She married her second husband in June \n1993 and legally separated from him in September 2004, at which time she left the state \nshe where she was living.  She was divorced in January 2005. (GE 1).  Within the past \ncouple of weeks, she remarried to a man who owns his own construction business. At \nthe time of the hearing, they were making arrangements to move to a new home. \n \n \nWhile married to her second husband, Applicant worked for a state agency for \neleven years, until she resigned her position in 2001. She then began a computer \nbusiness and worked from home, while her husband maintained his job as a manager of \na food market. Around that time, her husband, who managed the family finances and \nplayed in a band, began using drugs illegally and diverting household funds from family \nexpenses.  As a result, her bills began becoming delinquent. (Tr. 23; 34). Prior to this \ntime, she did not experience financial difficulties, other than for a brief time after her first \ndivorce in 1989. \n \n \nAfter leaving her home state in October 2004, Applicant moved to another state \nwith her two children and began working for an employment agency. For the next \ncouple years, she experienced periods of unemployment and under-employment, while \naccumulating a significant amount of debt that she could not manage. (Tr. 22). In \nAugust 2006, she began a position as a computer expert with a federal contractor. She \nworked there until last month when she was laid off, pending this hearing. (Tr. 42). She \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nearned about $10,000 in 2004; $14,934 in 2005; $27,932 in 2006; and $34,625 in 2007. \n(AE G). \n \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant consulted a bankruptcy lawyer. (Tr. 36). He advised her \nnot to pay any of her debts, including those for small amounts. (Tr. 64). On February 29, \n2008, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 Petition for Bankruptcy.  On June 24, 2008, the \nbankruptcy court entered an order discharging approximately $31,581 of debt, including \nsome that were attributable to her former husband\u2019s unpaid accounts. (AE L). As part of \nthe bankruptcy proceeding, she completed a five-hour credit counseling session over \nthe internet. (AE D at 4; Tr. 37). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 18 debts, totaling $21,070, and includes medical bills not \ncovered by insurance, credit card debt, utility bills, unpaid rent, and department stores \nbills. All of the debts alleged in the SOR are included in the discharge order.1 (Tr. 28) . \n \n \nApplicant submitted a copy of her budget. Her net monthly income is $1,292     \nthat she receives as an unemployment benefit. Her expenses total $1,290.2 Both of her \nchildren are working and no longer live with her. She does not have any credit cards or \nother outstanding debts. (Tr. 61). She asserted a commitment to her job that she finds \nvery satisfying and managing her finances. (Tr. 77). She admitted that in the past she \ndid not take adequate responsibility for her finances, resulting in debt and financial \ndifficulties. At 42, she wants to begin saving money for her retirement. (Tr. 67). She \nacknowledged her mistakes and stated, \u201cI\u2019ve learned some tough lessons, very tough \nlessons. The counseling that I took has helped a lot. I\u2019m not a person who is prone to \ngoing out and just spending wildly. I do have self-restraint. I think I just had to learn how \nto budget.\u201d (Tr. 59). \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted six letters from her colleagues in support of her \nrequest for a security clearance. Her direct supervisor for the past year and 8 months \nknows of Applicant\u2019s personal life. He does not believe she is a security risk. (AE F at \n3). A naval Captain, who has worked with Applicant, wrote, \u201cFrom my perspective, \n[Applicant\u2019s] dependability as a worker, her strong patriotism, her long term goals, and \nher personal character would prevent her from taking any questionable short cut to \nimprove her situation.\u201d (AE at 2). A retired senior chief electronics technician with the \nNavy, who has known her since 1983, believes Applicant is a \u201chonest, hard-working, all-\nAmerican. I understand the circumstances she\u2019s been through that would cast doubt on \nher ability to hold a clearance, but her integrity and patriotism are unsurpassed.\u201d (AE at  \n6).  On July 8, 2008, the security director for her employer submitted a request that \nDOHA expedite the security determination process because he would like her to \nresume her position as soon as possible. (AE N). \n \n                                            \n1According to Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy lawyer, \u201cPursuant to 6th Circuit precedent In re Madaj, F.3d \n467, if a debtor inadvertently omits a creditor from her bankruptcy schedules in a no asset Chapter 7 \ncase, the debt is nonetheless discharged. Because [Applicant\u2019s] Chapter 7 case was a no asset case \n[SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and1.e are the same debt] is discharged.\u201d (AE I).  \n2Applicant recently remarried and her husband\u2019s income is not included in this income number. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security \nconcerns. Applicant accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt, which began \naccruing in 2001 while married to her husband that she was unable to pay. The \ndelinquencies have been ongoing until they were recently discharged in a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The guideline includes six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated when Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant=s \nfinancial worries arose in 2001 and continued into 2008. Because the problems were \nunresolved for about seven years, this condition cannot apply.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s debts began \naccumulating as a result of her husband\u2019s illegal drug use, and her subsequent decision \nto move out of the house and get divorced. They were exacerbated by extended periods \nof unemployment and under-employment. Those circumstances were outside of her \ncontrol. However, she did not present any evidence indicating that she attempted to \nmanage her debts over those years, as further required under this condition. Thus, I find \nthis potentially mitigating condition has partial application.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where \u201cthe \nevidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant presented evidence that she obtained formal credit \ncounseling and she submitted a copy of her budget.  In February 2008, she filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy that discharged approximately $31,000 of debt, including those \ndelinquencies listed on the SOR. A recent bankruptcy, absent a track record of financial \nresponsibility subsequent to the bankruptcy, may be insufficient evidence to trigger the \napplication of these two mitigating conditions in many cases.3 However, based on her \ncurrent budget and change in family circumstances, along with her new knowledge of \nfinancial management, I conclude these mitigating conditions should be given some \nconsideration, as she took steps to resolve her delinquencies and her other expenses \nare under control.   \n \nNo other mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 42-year-old woman, \nwho began experiencing financial difficulties in 2001 after she left her husband, who \nwas abusing drugs. Applicant had over a ten-year history of full employment during \nwhich time she did not incur financial difficulties. At this point in her life, she no longer is \nsupporting her children, recently remarried a man who is fully employed, and is \ncommitted to achieving financial stability and security. Given her awareness of the effect \n                                            \n3 See e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (Dec. 31, 1997) at p.4 (\u201cWhile a discharge in bankruptcy is \nintended to provide a person with a fresh start financially, it does not immunize an applicant\u2019s history of \nfinancial problems from being considered for its security significance.\u201d) \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nthat future delinquencies could have on her employment, coupled with her organized \npresentation that demonstrated her understanding of her situation and her employer\u2019s \nstrong support, I do not believe similar financial problems will recur in the future.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant is an intelligent, \nhardworking individual, who experienced unanticipated family problems that seriously \naffected her financial life. There is no other evidence in her background to indicate that \nher financial problems may create a security risk. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r: \n       For Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate Guideline F (Financial Considerations) security \nconcerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 10, 2006, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions or \nStandard Form (SF 86).1 In July 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1  Form Item 5. \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nDecember 5, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn August 21 and September 26, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing (Items 2,3, and 4). A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), \ndated September 30, 2008, was provided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM, notarized on November 10, 2008, was another answer to the \nSOR in which he again admitted all the allegations. Otherwise, he did not provide any \nadditional comments or response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 19, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old ship builder, \u201cpumper,\u201d and \u201ccleaner\u201d working for a \ndefense contractor.4 He graduated from high school in 1979. He has never been \nmarried, but has two children, ages 26 and 17. He did not serve in the military. He \ndisclosed no police record; no use of illegal drugs in the last seven years; and no \nalcohol-related problems, counseling or treatment in the last seven years. He has \nworked for the same employer, a government contractor, since August 1980. Applicant \nindicated he received access to classified information at the secret level in 1981. \nApparently, his access has never been suspended or revoked. \n \nIn his 2006 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he filed for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection in October 1999. He was discharged of his debts in \nJanuary 2000. He also disclosed a garnishment of wages in 2003, and a repossession \nof property, date unknown (Item 6).5 He failed to disclose, however, two judgments \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  The DOHA transmittal letter is dated October 1, 2008. Applicant signed the receipt for the \nDOHA transmittal letter on October 15, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had \n30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit information. \n \n4  Item 5 (2006 SF 86) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n5  August 2006 credit report. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nawarded against him in 2000 for $325 and $1,319. Applicant also failed to disclose that \nin the last seven years he had numerous debts over 180 days delinquent, and that at \nthe time he filed his security clearance application he had numerous debts that had \nbeen delinquent over 90 days (Items 6, 7, & 8). \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial problems and \nincluded the review of credit reports from 2006 (Item 6), 2007 (Item 7), and 2008 (Item \n8). Additionally, it considered Applicant\u2019s answer to DOHA interrogatories (Item 9), \nwhich included his financial statement, a copy of his weekly pay stub, and an April 2008 \ncredit report. \n \nThe DOHA interrogatories asked Applicant (in part) to explain and/or document \nthe status of 13 delinquent accounts, including eight that were alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s only response with respect to the alleged debts was to indicate: \u201cI plan to \nmake arrangements in May.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM failed to address any of his delinquent debts. \nHe failed to provide any information as to how he acquired the debts, why they became \ndelinquent, what efforts he took, if any, to resolve his debts, and what measures he has \ntaken to avoid similar financial problems in the future. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n \n6  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers to \nDOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response.  \n \nApplicant provided no information as to why he had to file for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy protection in 1999 or the amount of the debts that were discharged. He \nadmitted responsibility for nine unpaid delinquent debts which he acquired after his \nbankruptcy discharge (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.j), totaling over $10,000. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,8 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to raise the \napplicability of any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. Based on his security \nclearance application, Applicant has continuously worked for his current employer since \n1980. He presented no evidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented \nnegotiations, payment plans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. It is unclear \nwhen his last payments were made on any of these nine delinquent debts. Considering \nthe record as a whole, I conclude these nine debts, totaling about $10,000 are still valid, \ndelinquent debts, and that Applicant is responsible for them.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nhe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control \nof his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are \nrecent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. He has not carried his \nburden of proving his financial responsibility. His overall financial behavior casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s 28 year record of employment for a government contractor weighs in \nhis favor. He has had access to classified information at the secret level since 1981. \n \n8  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. Aside from his delinquent debts (which is \na civil, non-criminal issue), he is a law-abiding citizen. These factors show some \nresponsibility and mitigation. The overall amount of his delinquent debt at about $10,000 \nis relatively low.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of delinquent debt as shown by his 2000 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nApplicant has had access to classified information since 2001. As such, he was or \nshould have been well aware of his financial responsibilities, and that his failure to be \nfinancially responsible would raise security clearance concerns.  \n \nAside from his 2000 bankruptcy, he failed to show any effort whatsoever to \nresolve his delinquent debts prior to or after receipt of the SOR. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 2004. He graduated from college in 2001. He is not married. He has a three-year-old daughter. Applicant was arrested on or about June 8, 1998, and charged with one count of Reckless Handling of a Firearm and one count of Possession of Marijuana. The firearms charge was dismissed and he was found guilty of the marijuana charge. Applicant received a suspended sentence and a fine. Applicant was arrested on or about July 1, 1999, and charged with Possession of a Controlled Substance with Intention to Distribute (cocaine). He was found guilty and sentenced to five years in jail, with the sentence suspended for all but four months of \u201cshock incarceration.\u201d He stated in his answer to interrogatories the following: I never was a user, manufacturer, or a user of cocaine.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nJ, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn August 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nJ, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 22, 2008, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on October 24, 2008. The FORM was \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 3, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nmailed to Applicant on October 29, 2008, and it was received on November 3, 2008. \nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit \nadditional material. The case was assigned to me on January 21, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 2004. He \ngraduated from college in 2001. He is not married. He has a three-year-old daughter.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on or about June 8, 1998, and charged with one count of \nReckless Handling of a Firearm and one count of Possession of Marijuana. The \nfirearms charge was dismissed and he was found guilty of the marijuana charge. \nApplicant received a suspended sentence and a fine.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on or about July 1, 1999, and charged with Possession of \na Controlled Substance with Intention to Distribute (cocaine). He was found guilty and \nsentenced to five years in jail, with the sentence suspended for all but four months of \n\u201cshock incarceration.\u201d He stated in his answer to interrogatories the following:  \n \n \nI never was a user, manufacturer, or a user of cocaine. The incident which \nI was arrested for charges me with distribution. Just for the record, I was \nnever a cocaine supplier or distributor. Just someone trying to make some \nextra money, but went about it the wrong way.1 \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on or about September 4, 2001, and charged with Driving \nUnder the Influence (DUI). He was fined and received a suspended sentence. His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for a year and he was ordered to attend an alcohol \nsafety program.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on or about April 1, 2007, and charged with one count of \nFelony Eluding Police and Endangering Police or Police Car; one count of Driving While \nIntoxicated (DWI); one count of Reckless Driving, and one count of Improperly Stopping \nVehicle. The Felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and he was fined $500. He \npleaded guilty to DWI and was fined, sentenced to 12 months in jail with all but 20 days \nsuspended. He received three years probation and his driver\u2019s license was suspended \nfor three years. He was ordered to attend an alcohol safety program. The remaining \ncharges were dismissed.  \n \n \n1 Item 6. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to intoxication, between at \nleast September 4, 2001 and at least April 1, 2007. \n \n \nIn his answer to interrogatories Applicant stated he turned his life around and no \nlonger participates in any illegal activities.2 He also wrote that he stopped using illegal \nsubstances in 2002 because he decided to grow up and he needed to do better.3 He \nchecked the box on the interrogatory question that said he did not intend to consume \nalcohol beverages in the future.4 There was no amplifying information as to what recent \nsteps Applicant has taken regarding his alcohol consumption. He is not participating in \nAlcoholics Anonymous.5 No other amplifying information was provided to show what \nApplicant has done substantively to change his life or mitigate the security concerns \nraised. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n \n2 AE 6. \n \n3 AE 7. \n \n4 AE 9. \n \n5 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person \nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested five times in a nine year period from June 1998 to April \n2007. Three arrests were drug related and two involved alcohol. His last arrest was a \nfelony charge of Eluding Police and Endangering Police or Police Car, as well as DWI, \nReckless Driving and Improperly Stopping Vehicle. Applicant pled guilty as part of a \nplea agreement. The felony was reduced to a misdemeanor. He also pled guilty to the \nDWI, received 12 months in jail (all but 20 days suspended), and was placed on \n\n \n5 \n \n \nprobation for three years. Applicant is currently on probation. His probation continues \nuntil 2010. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under AG \u00b6 \n23 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant has a nine-year criminal history for drug and alcohol offenses, the most \nrecent having occurred in 2007. He remains on probation for the most recent offenses \nuntil 2010. I find (a) does not apply because Applicant is still on probation and no \nevidence was offered to show his conduct is unlikely to recur. His repeated conduct \nover a significant period of years casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. \n \n \nApplicant failed to provide any substantive evidence that he has changed his \nways and is successfully rehabilitated. Not enough time has passed to come to this \nconclusion, nor is there any evidence in the record to reflect the contrary. I find (d) does \nnot apply. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 including:  \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant has two alcohol-related incidents in 2001 and 2007, for DUI and DWI. \nThe above disqualifying condition applies.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 and \nespecially considered: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s statements that he has not consumed alcohol since his \nlast alcohol-related arrest in 2007. Applicant did not provide any other credible evidence \nto show what he has done to overcome his issues with alcohol. He apparently was \nrequired to attend an alcohol safety program after his first alcohol-related, but did not \nheed its warnings. No evidence was presented to confirm any treatment program, \nattendance at Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization or any prognosis from a \nmedical professional. Without supporting evidence Applicant\u2019s latest alcohol-related \nincident is too recent to conclude another is unlikely to recur or that he has overcome \nhis problem or is successfully rehabilitated. I find none of the above mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 31 years old and has a \nnine-year history of drug and alcohol abuse and criminal offenses. He remains on \nprobation until 2010 for his latest criminal activity. Insufficient time has passed since his \nlast offense and he has not provided any substantive evidence to convince me he is \nsuccessfully rehabilitated. Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the Guidelines for Criminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b. \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant denied ten and admitted one of the allegations under Guideline F. He admitted the ten allegations under Guideline E and denied the allegation under Guideline J. He provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 41 years old and has worked for a defense contractor for about two years as a test instrumentation engineer. He is a college graduate with a degree in engineering. Applicant served on active duty in the Navy for twelve years, in the active Navy Reserve for five years, and in the inactive Navy Reserve for four years. He held a security clearance while on active duty with the Navy but did not require access to classified information in the Navy Reserve. Applicant married in 1991 and divorced in 2001. There were three children from this marriage. He provides child support for the children to included paying arrearage on child support (App. Ex. A, Divorce decree, dated August 24, 2001). The divorce was acrimonious (Tr. 39-42, 67-68, 73-76; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated April 17, 2007). Applicant recently married again and has no children from this marriage. He and his wife work for the same defense contractor. Their approximately monthly net pay is $8,000. Applicant's pay is debited for child support and garnishment (App. Ex. K and App. Ex.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) on April 17, \n2007.  On August 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F.  Applicant provided a written response to the SOR on \nAugust 28, 2008.  He denied ten of the allegations and admitted one allegation.  He \nprovided ten attachments to his response which appear to be letters from creditors that \nthe ten debts had been paid.  The one debt not paid was being paid through \ngarnishment of his wages.  DOHA issued an addendum to the SOR on January 8, 2009, \nalleging that the ten attachments to his response to the original SOR were false \ndocuments thereby raising a personal conduct security concern under Guideline E and \na criminal conduct security concern under Guideline J for providing false information in \nthe security clearance process.  The allegations in the Statement of Reasons was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the addendum to the SOR in writing on February 8, 2009.  \nHe admitted the documents he submitted were false as a result of an administrative \nerror.  He denied the criminal conduct security concern since he did not provide the \nfalse documents with intent to deceive.  He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 12, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on February 23, 2009.  DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing on February 24, 2009, for a hearing on March 19, 2009.  I convened the \nhearing as scheduled.  The government offered five exhibits, marked Government \nExhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his behalf, and submitted ten exhibits marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex) A \nthrough J which were received without objection.  The record was left open for Applicant \nto submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted five documents marked \nApp. Ex. K through O, on March 24, 2009.  The government did not object to the \nadmission of the documents (See Gov. Ex. 6, Department Counsel Letter, dated April 6, \n2009), and the documents are admitted into the record.  DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on March 26, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant denied ten and admitted one of the \nallegations under Guideline F.  He admitted the ten allegations under Guideline E and \ndenied the allegation under Guideline J.  He provided additional information to support \nhis request for eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nApplicant is 41 years old and has worked for a defense contractor for about two \nyears as a test instrumentation engineer.  He is a college graduate with a degree in \nengineering.  Applicant served on active duty in the Navy for twelve years, in the active \nNavy Reserve for five years, and in the inactive Navy Reserve for four years.  He held a \nsecurity clearance while on active duty with the Navy but did not require access to \nclassified information in the Navy Reserve.   \n \nApplicant married in 1991 and divorced in 2001.  There were three children from \nthis marriage.  He provides child support for the children to included paying arrearage \non child support (App. Ex. A, Divorce decree, dated August 24, 2001).  The divorce was \nacrimonious (Tr. 39-42, 67-68, 73-76; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated April 17, 2007). \n \nApplicant recently married again and has no children from this marriage.  He and \nhis wife work for the same defense contractor.  Their approximately monthly net pay is \n$8,000.  Applicant's pay is debited for child support and garnishment (App. Ex. K and \nApp. Ex. L, Pay information, dated March 19, 2009).  The couple has monthly expenses \nof about $5,000, leaving approximately $3,000 in monthly disposable income (Tr.73-76). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86) in \nJune 2006 as part of his employment with the defense contractor.  A subsequent \nsecurity investigation shows the following delinquent debts for Applicant: a cell phone \naccount in collection for $1,098 (SOR 1.a); a medical debt in collection for $65 (SOR \n1.b); a cable debt in collection for $121 (SOR 1.c); a mail order debt charged off for \n$393 (SOR 1.d); a car repossession judgment being collected by garnishment for \n$11,000 (SOR 1.e); a cell phone debt in collection for $292 (SOR 1.f); a loan in \ncollection for $1,180 (SOR 1.g); a credit card debt in collection for $2,009 (SOR 1.h); \nanother credit card debt in collection for $1,012 (SOR 1.i); a loan debt in collection for \n$2,237 (SOR 1.j); and a cable debt in collection for $517 (SOR 1.k) (See Gov. Ex. 3, \nCredit report, dated April 18, 2007; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated March 13, 2008; and \nGov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated February 11, 2009).   \n \nApplicant noted that most of the debts started when he and his first wife were in \nthe process of divorcing.  He noted that his wife during this time had the ability to open \naccounts in his name.  He presented no information to substantiate any illegal actions \nby his former wife or that she opened accounts in his name without his knowledge.  \nApplicant also noted that during this time he moved frequently and was unemployed at \ntimes.  This made it hard for him to keep current with his debts.  Applicant was not sure \nof the origin of some of the debts, so he wrote the credit reporting agencies to dispute \nthe debts at SOR 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j (Tr. 67-69).   \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.a and 1.f are the same debt for cell phone service from \nthe same company in collection by different agencies.  The debt was disputed and \nresolved in Applicant's favor.  It is no longer considered by the credit reporting agencies \nas a debt for Applicant (Tr. 21-22, 30-31, 43-43; App. Ex. B, Letter resolving dispute, \ndated January 24, 2009).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.b is a medical debt incurred by Applicant for treatment of \nhis son in 2002.  The account was paid in full in 2009.  Applicant did not know of the \ndebt until he received the original SOR.  He moved after his son received the treatment \nso he never received a bill from the medical facility (Tr. 34-35, 43-45; App. Ex. H, \nReceipt, dated January 29, 2009).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.c is a cable bill in collection.  Applicant does not have any \nknowledge concerning this debt (Tr. 47). \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.d and 1.j are the same debt from a mail order company.  \nApplicant transferred this debt to another credit card.  The transfer resolved the debts \nfor the creditors listed in SOR 1.d and 1.j.  Applicant is current on his payments for the \ncredit card and the present balance on the revolving account is $25 (Tr. 22-27, 47-49; \nApp. Ex. C, Credit card statement, dated June. 21, 2008; App. Ex. D, Transfer letter, \ndated April 15, 2008). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.e is for the remainder debt from an involuntary car \nrepossession.  The debt was reduced to a judgment and his wages are garnished $200 \n\n \n4 \n \n \nper month to pay the judgment.  He has been paying on the debt for two years and the \ndebt has been reduced.  Applicant does not know the current balance on the debt (Tr. \n49-51).   \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1. g and 1.h are the same and were originally from a \ncredit card used during his first marriage.  He is not sure when the account was opened, \nby whom, and who used the card.  He tried to get some information on the accounts \nfrom the collection agencies but they were uncooperative.  This debt has not been \nresolved (Tr. 52-54).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.i is a bank credit card.  Applicant believes it was the \ngovernment travel credit card he used when he was in the Navy Reserve.  The credit \ncard was opened in 1999 and Applicant started in the Navy Reserve in 1998.  He \ninquired about the card from the bank but has not received a reply (Tr. 54-55). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.k is a debt for a cable company.  Applicant and his \nformer wife had service from the cable company before their divorce.  He contacted the \ncompany but has not received information on the account (Tr. 56-57). \n \nApplicant responded to the August 5, 2008 SOR allegation of eleven delinquent \ndebts on August 28, 2008.  Applicant admitted one of the debts, the car repossession, \nbut noted it was being paid by wage garnishment.  He denied the other ten debts.  His \nresponse to each of the SOR allegations states \"I deny remaining in debt to _ _ _ (the \ncreditor).\"  Applicant attached ten letters from creditors stating that the debts had been \npaid in full and the dates that the account was paid.  The attachment letters appeared to \nhave the letterhead of the creditor, account numbers or account information, and the \nsignatures of an official from the creditor.  The letterheads were created by Applicant \nfrom information on the creditors' web sites.  The signatures were computer generated \n(Response to SOR, dated August 28, 2008, Attachments 1-10). \n \nApplicant admits that he created the letters using the creditors' logos from the \ncreditors' computer web site.  The account information is either created or made to \nmatch account information on credit reports.  The signatures were computer generated \nby Applicant.  In at least two letters, the signature name and signature of the creditor's \nofficial is the same for two different companies at two different locations (See Response \nto SOR, dated August 28, 2008, attachments 2 and 3).  Applicant stated that he tried to \nget information from the creditors but in many instances the creditor was uncooperative.  \nHe drafted the letters to send to the creditors as an example of a letter he wanted from \nthem.  He stated that he sent the letters to the creditors with a cover letter explaining \nthat he needed information on accounts in his name.  He told the creditors that the \nattached sample letter was an example of the letter he expected in return.  He did not \ninclude the cover letter in his August 28, 2008 Response to the SOR.  A cover letter \nwas provided at the hearing.  The date on the cover letter provided at the hearing was \nAugust 20, 2009.  Applicant explained that the date was a typographical error and \nshould have been August 20, 2008 (Tr. 36-39, 56-67, 71-73).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant received some letters from creditors concerning his delinquent \naccounts.  He stated he received information in response to the debt at SOR 1.b, but he \ndid not provide that response.  He received information concerning the status of the \nsame debt listed at SOR 1.g and 1.h (App. Ex. M, Letter, dated March 13, 2009).  He \nreceived a reply concerning the same debt listed at SOR 1.d and 1.j (App. Ex. N, Letter, \ndated March 18, 2009).  There is no indication that these letters were in response to the \ncover letter dated August 20, 2009 (Tr. 71-73, 89; App. Ex. O, Applicant's letter, dated \nMarch 24, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts that Applicant admits and are listed in credit reports \nare a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\".  Applicant accumulated delinquent debt after his 2001 \ndivorce, and some of the debts have yet to be resolved or paid according to a payment \nplan.  There are actually eight delinquent debts since three of the debts are the same \ndebts listed under different creditors (SOR 1.a and 1f, SOR 1.d and 1.J, and SOR 1.g. \nand 1.h). \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence to establish the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).  The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15).  An applicant has the burden to refute an \nestablished allegation or prove a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it \nnever shifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005)).   \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\", and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances\"; and FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\"  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded.   \n \n \nThe delinquent debts were incurred prior to Applicant's divorce from his first wife \nin 2001.  He disputed one of the debts and it was resolved in his favor by the credit \nreporting agency (SOR 1.a).  One debt has been paid in full (SOR 1.b).  One debt has \nbeen transferred to another credit card and that account is current (SOR 1.d).  One debt \nhas been subject to garnishment after a judgment for over two years and the debt is \nbeing paid as agreed (SOR 1.e).  With regard to the debts alleged in SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, \nand 1.e, Applicant has established either payment of the debts or a good faith effort to \npay them.  These debts are no lot of security concern. \n \n \nApplicant stated he has no knowledge of the remaining four debts.  He has not \ninquired about one of the debts.  He inquired about three of the debts but received no \nreply  or inadequate responses from the creditors.  He has not followed up on any of his \ninquiries.  The debts are current debts since they have not been paid.  The conditions \nthat led to his debts may have been beyond his control since they could have been \nincurred by his first wife without his knowledge or permission.  However, Applicant has \npresented no information to substantiate his claim that the debts were incurred by his \nfirst wife without his permission.  In addition, he did not establish that under the \ncircumstances he acted responsibly towards his debts.  He made minimal inquires and \nhas not followed up on his requests for information.  He is unsure of the amount owed \non some of the debts.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to meet his \nburden of establishing that he acted in good-faith and responsibly.  He still has \nsignificant current delinquent debts.  Applicant noted periods of unemployment.  \nHowever, he presented no information to show how his lack of steady work affected his \nfinances or caused financial problems.  He has not presented any information to show \nhis financial problems will not recur.  None of the mitigating conditions (\u00b6 20 (a), \u00b6 20(b), \nand \u00b6 20 (d)) apply to the four debts still not being addressed by Applicant.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under \ncontrol\" does not apply.  Applicant did not present any information on any financial \ncounseling he has received.  He has not presented any information to establish that his \nfinances are under control. \n \nApplicant has no concrete plan for how he will pay his remaining delinquent \ndebts.  He has not contacted creditors to learn about his debts and arrange acceptable \nconditions for paying the debts.  In short, he has no plan of attack to stabilize his debts \nand be current with his payments.  He has not made any consistent payments on the \ndebts.  He has not indicated a strong desire to pay the debts, and thus has not shown a \n\n \n8 \n \n \ngood-faith effort to pay them.  Applicant's actions do not establish that he is financially \nresponsible.  He has not mitigated security concerns raised by his financial situation. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant provided false creditor letters \nshowing debts were paid to security adjudicators.  This action raises security concerns \nunder Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(b) \"deliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative.\" \n \n \nI have also considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) AG \u00b6 \n17(a) \"the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts\"; PC MC AG \u00b6 17(c) \n\"the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; and PC MC \nAG \u00b6 17(d) \" the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate \nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\". \n \n \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false or misleading information.  He \nadmitted that the creditor letters he provided to a security adjudicator were false.  He \nstated he was having difficulty receiving information from creditors so he sent them the \nletters as an example of letters he should receive in response to his inquiry.  He stated \nhe sent the letters with a cover letter outlining his desires.  He claims an administrative \nerror led to the confusion with the security adjudicator.  He failed to send the adjudicator \nthe cover letter.  Applicant's testimony on this issue was not credible.  It is inconceivable \nthat an applicant would send sample letters on creditor letterhead complete with \naccount numbers, account information, and the signatures of officials from the creditor \nstating debts were paid in full on a certain date as an example of letters that the person \nwould like to receive in return.  It is also inconceivable that a person would send copies \nof ten separate letters to a security adjudicator without a full and complete explanation.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe response to the SOR letter to the security adjudicator only said that Applicant \ndenied a debt to the creditor.  That letter together with the attached paid in full letters \nfrom creditors could only lead the security adjudicator to the conclusion that the debts \nhad been paid in full.  A falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it \nis done knowingly and willfully.  I find Applicant deliberately sent false payment letters to \nthe security adjudicator with the intent to deceive her into believing the debts had been \npaid.  The government established that Applicant acted deliberately with the intent to \ndeceive the security adjudicator.  Applicant has not established that he did not \ndeliberately provide the false information to the security adjudicator with intent to \ndeceive.  I find against Applicant as to all ten allegations of Personal Conduct.   \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30).  A federal criminal statute makes \nit a criminal act to deliberately provide false information during the security investigation \nprocess.  Applicant provided false letters to a security adjudicator in response to an \nSOR.  Applicant denied that his action in providing the false letters was a criminal act.  \nThe government must establish by substantial evidence controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR.  Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the \nrecord (See, directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, ISCR Case No. 04-11463 (App. Bd. Aug 4, 2006)).  \nSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F. 3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)).  Applicant \nadmitted the letters were false.  Based on Applicant's admissions, the government \nestablished by substantial evidence the criminal offense alleged in the SOR.  These \nfacts raise Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) \"a single serious \ncrime or multiple lesser offenses\", and CD DC \u00b6 31(c) \"allegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted\".  Deliberately providing false information to a government \nagent is a serious crime.  Even though charges may not have been prosecuted, they \nare still allegations of criminal conduct that raise a security concern.  \n \n \nAs noted above, the government produced substantial evidence to establish the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).  The burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the criminal conduct \nconcerns.  An applicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.   \n \n \nAppellant has raised by his testimony Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \n(CC MC) \u00b6 32 (a) \"so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; CC MC \u00b6 \n32(c) \"evidence that the person did not commit the offense\"; and CC MC \u00b6 32(d) \"there \nis evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time \n\n \n10 \n \n \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\".  \nApplicant provided false information to the security adjudicator in August 2008, only a \nfew months ago.  The criminal action was recent, deliberate and not under any unusual \ncircumstance.  The criminal actions seriously cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  The false and misleading letters he provided were an attempt to show \nhis finances in a positive light.  This false conduct could recur at any time Applicant \ndetermined he had to show a positive image of himself.  Applicant admitted he provided \nthe false letters but he intended to provide an explanatory cover letter.  His explanation \nlacked credibility.  The wording of his response to the SOR and the ten false letters can \nonly lead to the conclusion he acted deliberately with the intent to deceive.  Since the \ncrime happened recently, the passage of time is not sufficient to show that the acts are \nunlikely to recur and no longer cast doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness.  I am \nconvinced by a preponderance of the evidence that Applicant deliberately intended to \ndeceive the security adjudicator when he provided her with false and misleading creditor \nletters.  Applicant has not established that his actions were just an administrative error \nand that he is successfully rehabilitated.  Applicant has not mitigated or refuted the \ncriminal conduct security concerns alleged under Guideline J. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant has \nserved in the active or Reserve Navy for almost twenty years.  Applicant has paid some \nof his delinquent debts but not all of them.  He does not have a concrete plan for paying \nhis remaining delinquent debts.  He has acted irresponsibly towards his finances by not \ninquiring about all of his debts and by not following through on attempts to reach \ncreditors for account information and payment plans.  This indicates that he may be \n\n \n11 \n \n \nirresponsible towards the obligation to safeguard classified information.  Applicant's lack \nof concrete management of his finances indicates poor self control, lack of judgment, \nand responsible action.  He deliberately provided false and misleading information to a \nsecurity adjudicator with the intent to deceive her into believing that his debts had been \npaid in full.  Deliberately providing of false and misleading information to the \ngovernment is a violation of federal criminal law.  Overall, on balance the record \nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations, personal conduct, \nand criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 43-year-old, single woman with three children, ages four, seventeen, and twenty-one. She has a high school education and has been working as a security guard since 1992. In March 1998, Applicant was diagnosed with breast cancer (Tr. 34). The following year she underwent surgery. The hospital that performed the surgery then billed her approximately $10,000 (Tr. 34). Applicant disputed the charge contending that she qualified for a state-sponsored program that was supposed to pay the entire bill (Tr. 35). The hospital sued Applicant. She then contacted someone from the state office that had allegedly told her the state would pay the cost of surgery (Tr. 36). The state 1 rejected her claim (Tr. 30). In October 2001, the hospital obtained a judgment against Applicant for $10,169 (Exhibit 6). Applicant\u2019s financial situation then \u201cbegan to go downhill\u201d (Exhibit 2 at 4). In October 2002, she was laid off from her job, and was unemployed for the next four months (Exhibit 1 at 16). She was also unemployed between January 2004 and February 2004 (Exhibit 1 at 14). Shortly after returning to work, her cancer returned, requiring her to have another surgery (Tr. 22). She underwent the surgery in April 2004, and missed more work while recuperating (Exhibit 2 at 4). It is unclear from the record how long she missed work after the second surgery (Compare Ex. 2 at 4, and Exhibit 1 at 16). By early 2008, Applicant had incurred approximately $41,500 of delinquent ",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program,\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 18, 2008, denying all of the allegations and\nrequesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 25, 2008. On September\n2, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for September 23, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, I received 10 government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on October 2, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nNovember 14, 2008\n\nAccording to Applicant, the program was not Medicaid. Instead, it was a program that compensated low-\n1\nincome patients who were seeking experimental treatment for cancer (Tr. 35).\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old, single woman with three children, ages four,\nseventeen, and twenty-one. She has a high school education and has been working as\na security guard since 1992.\nIn March 1998, Applicant was diagnosed with breast cancer (Tr. 34). The\nfollowing year she underwent surgery. The hospital that performed the surgery then\nbilled her approximately $10,000 (Tr. 34). Applicant disputed the charge contending that\nshe qualified for a state-sponsored program that was supposed to pay the entire bill (Tr.\n35). \nThe hospital sued Applicant. She then contacted someone from the state office\nthat had allegedly told her the state would pay the cost of surgery (Tr. 36).  The state\n1\nrejected her claim (Tr. 30). In October 2001, the hospital obtained a judgment against\nApplicant for $10,169 (Exhibit 6). \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation then \u201cbegan to go downhill\u201d (Exhibit 2 at 4). In\nOctober 2002, she was laid off from her job, and was unemployed for the next four\nmonths (Exhibit 1 at 16). She was also unemployed between January 2004 and\nFebruary 2004 (Exhibit 1 at 14). Shortly after returning to work, her cancer returned,\nrequiring her to have another surgery (Tr. 22). She underwent the surgery in April 2004,\nand missed more work while recuperating (Exhibit 2 at 4). It is unclear from the record\nhow long she missed work after the second surgery (Compare Ex. 2 at 4, and Exhibit 1\nat 16). \nBy early 2008, Applicant had incurred approximately $41,500 of delinquent debt.\nIn addition to the hospital judgment, as discussed earlier, the debt includes three liens\nfor delinquent state income taxes for tax years, 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2006 (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.d, 1.o through 1.q), a penalty her state imposed against her for failing\nto maintain car insurance (SOR subparagraph 1.a), two delinquent apartment rental\naccounts (subparagraphs 1.c and 1.h), three utility bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.i through\n1.k), a credit card account (SOR subparagraph 1.l), two deficiencies remaining from a\nrepossessed car and a repossessed motor scooter (SOR subparagraphs 1.m and 1.n),\nand two debts owed to a local municipality (SOR subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f). The\njudgments, the state-imposed penalty, the tax liens, and the delinquent rent constitute\napproximately 90% of her debt. \nApplicant\u2019s state of residence requires drivers to have car insurance (Exhibit A).\nBetween May 2002 and March 2006, Applicant did not maintain a car insurance policy.\nConsequently, in June 2008, the state imposed an uninsured motorist penalty fee\nagainst her for $5,052 (Id.). Since then, she has satisfied approximately $3,200 of the\n\nSOR subparagraph 1.g is a duplicate of SOR subparagraph 1.c.\n2\nShe had never filed for child support.\n3\n3\npenalty (Exhibit A at 5-9). Approximately $1,200 of this amount constitute state and\nfederal income tax intercepts (Id. at 8-9).\nApplicant alleges that her landlord, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c, billed her\nfor three months after she had moved from the apartment (Tr. 20).  The landlord sued,\n2\nand the court entered a judgment in his favor for $737. \nApplicant owes another landlord $1,751 in delinquent rental payments (Exhibit 10\nat 13). She alleges it \u201cwas thrown out of court\u201d (Tr. 22). She provided no documentary\nevidence supporting this contention.\nThe state income tax liens total approximately $4,060. The state will apply tax\nreturns to this delinquency after Applicant satisfies the uninsured motorist penalty. She\nhas not yet made any payments.\nShortly after Applicant underwent her second surgery, she began falling behind\non her car payments. Consequently, the creditor repossessed it (Tr. 25). She owes a\ndeficiency of $11,100 (Exhibit 10 at 11).\nIn June 2002, Applicant purchased a motor scooter for her boyfriend (Exhibit 9 at\n3). He was supposed to make the payments. When the relationship ended, he stopped\n(Tr. 25). Currently, Applicant owes the creditor approximately $5,325 (Exhibit 9 at 3).\nIn March 2008, Applicant consulted a credit counselor (Exhibit 2 at 8). After\nanalyzing her \u201ccurrent expenses, living expenses, assets, and liabilities,\u201d the counselor\nprepared a budget (Id. at 9). Her expenses exceeded her income by approximately\n$1,500. Consequently, the counselor recommended she file for bankruptcy protection\n(Tr. 32).\nAfter meeting with an attorney, Applicant decided not to file for bankruptcy (Tr.\n32). She continues to work with the credit counselor. They are focusing on getting some\nof the delinquencies removed from her credit report. \nApplicant has been working steadily since 2005. Before 2001, she had never\nreceived child support.  She has been receiving it without interruption since then.\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s financial problems trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d \nBetween 1998 and 2005, Applicant underwent two major surgeries and two\nperiods of unemployment. The first surgery resulted in a $10,000 bill that she\nunsuccessfully contested. With the help of a credit counselor, she has created a budget.\nAfter creating a budget, she met with a bankruptcy attorney. After rejecting the\nbankruptcy option, she is continuing to work with the credit counselor. \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s state tax liens preceded her cancer diagnosis. Nevertheless,\ngiven the severity of her misfortune that followed the diagnosis, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b),\n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d applies.\nApplicant has continued to consult with a counselor. Also, she has nearly\nsatisfied the uninsured motorist penalty. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is\n\n5\nreceiving counseling for the problem . . . ,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d \nMany of Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond\nher control. She has made sincere, good-faith efforts to reform her finances.\nUnfortunately, she lacks the income to execute a payment plan. Although she is\ncontinuing to work with a credit counselor to eliminate some of the delinquent debt, and\nshe has nearly satisfied the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a, the track\nrecord of financial reform is too minimal at this time for me to conclude her troubled\nfinances no longer pose a security risk. In reaching this conclusion, I am in no way\nminimizing the financial impact of her illness and resulting periods of unemployment.\nRather, I have concluded that these factors currently are outweighed by her continuing\nfinancial problems. Upon considering this case in light of the whole person concept, I\nconclude Applicant\u2019s application for access to classified information must be denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On January 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 15, 2008. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on April 9, 2008, and the hearing was held on June 13, 2008. At the\nhearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4) were admitted in evidence without objection to\nsupport the government\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s 12 exhibits (AE A through AE L) were\nAugust 20, 2008\n\n However, GE 1 (security clearance application (SCA)) indicates he was married in 1997, and separated in\n1\n2005.\n2\nreceived in evidence without objection. He also testified. DOHA received the transcript\non June 23, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR identifies three federal tax liens and two state tax liens. The federal\nliens total approximately $24,000.00 and the state liens amount to about $2,500.00 The\nliens were filed after Applicant failed to pay taxes for certain tax years identified in AE E.\nApplicant admitted the five allegations under the financial considerations guideline of the\nSOR. Applicant is 45 years old and single. He has been working for his current\nemployer since August 2005. He is employed as a K-9 assistant. He did not recall being\nunemployed during is working career. \nApplicant received his Bachelor\u2019s degree from college in 1987. He was a\npoliceman for several years, then a car salesman in State X. Applicant testified he was\ndivorced in 1997 (Tr. 23),  and ordered to pay child support. Though the record is not\n1\nclear about the date of the divorce and when his wife relocated, at some point after the\ndivorce, his wife moved with the children to the local area in State Y. \nApplicant moved from State X to the local area in 2005 to be closer to his three\nchildren. He worked for one company for about a year and a half, before hiring on with\nhis current employer in August 2005. \nBetween 1999 and 2004, Applicant was contributing to the support of his\ndaughter\u2019s educational costs for college. According to Applicant, low paying jobs and\nnot having enough money were reasons he could not pay his taxes. To receive more\nmoney in his paycheck, Applicant claimed five exemptions although he had only three\nchildren. He made the decision to claim more exemptions after his coworkers told him\nthis would increase his take home pay. Even before the liens were filed against him,\nApplicant recalled receiving notices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the\ncounterpart agency in State X requesting him to pay the delinquent taxes. Applicant\u2019s\nW-2 earning form for 2007 shows that he claimed one federal exemption (himself) and\nthree state exemptions. (AE C) When asked why he declared three exemptions in his\nW-2 form for the state, he stated:\nInitially, it was just like for the federal. I was claiming high exemptions\nbecause I could get more money back. For the State of [Y], the years that\nI\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve always got a return with three exemptions and I just\nhadn\u2019t changed it. (Tr. 83)\nIn 2003, Applicant collaborated with an accountant to prepare his taxes for that\nyear. The first time he sought help for his federal and state tax problems occurred in\nOctober 2007. He paid a tax relief organization more than $2000.00 in late 2007 and\n\n3\nearly 2008 to arrange a settlement with the IRS. However, the terms of the settlement\nare not in the record. AE E is the first page of correspondence from the IRS dated\nFebruary 13, 2008. Subsequent pages of the letter appear to be missing. The first page\nindicates that the first $500.00 payment to the IRS was to be made on March 28, 2008,\nwith $500.00 payments monthly thereafter until the lien was paid. Applicant has\ndocumented proof of five payments to the IRS, and is confident he will have the federal\ndebt paid in the spring of 2009. He claims he has paid $16,000.00 toward the resolution\nof the liens. No documentation was presented in support of his claim. The\ndocumentation in the record shows Applicant paid about $2,000.00 to the tax relief\norganization, $2,500.00 to the IRS in first five months of 2008, and $3,200.00 to the IRS\nin the form of a refund for 2007 that was impounded by the IRS. Applicant still owes\nState X about $2,500.00, and has a tax preparer assisting him with the state taxes, but\nsupplied no documentation of an agreement to repay State X. (AE C) GE 3 reflects\nApplicant resolved a state tax lien of $613.00 in March 2007. \nApplicant provided no evidence concerning his job performance. Other than the\nevidence about his former marriage (which ended in divorce) and his child support, the\nonly evidence he presented about his lifestyle is the Selective Service information, and\nthe criminal form showing that a misdemeanor case was dismissed because he had\ncompleted the requirements imposed during the pre-trial phase of his case in 2003.\nAbout three months ago, he began a part-time job as a doorman at a restaurant earning\nabout $250.00 every two weeks. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d \nThe SOR identifies five federal and state tax liens filed against Applicant between\n2001 and July 2007. Applicant stopped paying his taxes from the late 1990s to about\n2005, when he moved to the local area. As a result, more than $26,000.00 in federal\nand state tax liens have been filed against him. The government has established its\ncase under the financial FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts),  FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC\nDC 19.f. (failure to file annual Federal, state or local income tax returns as required or\nthe fraudulent filing of same). The good judgment Applicant exercised in at least filing\nhis tax returns is subverted by the intentionally dishonest conduct in claiming five\nexemptions so he could bring home a larger paycheck during the year, and still not pay\nhis taxes at the end of the year. Applicant knew that misrepresenting his exemptions\nwas wrong. He also knew he should have paid his taxes.\nThere are five mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances. They are: FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\n\n5\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment);\nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control, and the individual acted reasonably under the circumstances); FC\nMC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is resolved or under control); FC MC 20.d.\n(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts);\nand, FC MC 20.e. (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause or of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue). FC MC 20.a. does not apply. Had Applicant\u2019s dishonest conduct ended in 2005,\nthen his favorable evidence of payments since October 2007 (to the tax negotiator and\nthe IRS) to eliminate the tax liens may have been sufficient to overcome his failure to\npay taxes for the lengthy period of time set forth in the SOR. However, Applicant is still\nclaiming an incorrect number of exemptions in State Y, a different state. Though the\nincorrect number of exemptions could have occurred unintentionally or by oversight,\nthat is not the most reasonable explanation given Applicant\u2019s record for not declaring\nproper exemptions in the past, and, in not paying his taxes. Someone had to inform the\ntax authority in State Y of the number exemptions to initially declare. \nApplicant gains no benefit from FC MC 20.b. as low paying jobs do not mitigate\nthe failure to pay taxes. Providing financial assistance to his daughter so she could\nobtain her college degree was a commendable act by Applicant. But, his assistance\ndoes not excuse his failure to pay taxes. Applicant has presented no evidence to\nsuggest that his federal and state tax problems resulted from unforeseen events. \nApplicant receives limited mitigation under FC MC 20.c. and FC MC 20.d.\nThough he has had no counseling, he has a five-month record of paying off the federal\ntax lien. He also paid the state tax lien in March 2007. The evidence of payment is\ninsufficient to meet Applicant\u2019s ultimate burden of persuasion under the FC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and whole person concept. The WPC is made of nine\ngeneral policy factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nthe participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nAt the age of 35 or 36, Applicant decided to inflate his exemptions and not pay\nhis taxes for a significant period of time. This course of conduct was not isolated.\nRather, it occurred from the late 1990s to about 2005. The record shows that even after\nhe moved to the local area in State Y, he continued to inflate his state exemptions as\nsubstantiated by his W-2 form for 2007. (AE C) While Applicant is congratulated for\nfinally hiring a tax relief agency to negotiate a repayment plan with the IRS, and then\ndeveloping a short track record of payment, he is still engaged in a practice that resulted\nin owing the IRS and State X tax agency more than $26,000.00. The false state\nexemptions, which were the primary reason for Applicant\u2019s previous inability to pay his\ntaxes, raise ongoing credibility issues in Applicant\u2019s overall case in mitigation. These\ncredibility issues cannot be overlooked or excused. Accordingly, the FC guideline is\nfound against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

I received the case assignment on June 25,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 30, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on July 30, 2008. During the hearing, I received three government exhibits\nand ten Applicant exhibits. C. Based upon a review of the record evidence, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nAugust 29, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 56-year-old married man with two adult children. He served in the\nU.S. Navy from 1973 until his honorable discharge in 1979. He has a bachelor of\nscience degree in business administration, and he currently works as a senior-level\nmanagement consultant whose clients include several government agencies (Tr. 74).\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to his supervisor, \u201che has\nperformed well, developed good business relationships with [their] clients, and resolved\ntough issues to preserve good business relations\u201d (Exhibit E). \nApplicant has a drinking problem. He began drinking alcohol as a teenager. By\nthe time he left the Navy, he was drinking up to four beers per day (Tr. 56). In 1984, he\nwas arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was\nsentenced to several hours in jail, and required to attend an alcohol-education program. \nThrough the alcohol-education program, Applicant began attending Alcoholic\u2019s\nAnonymous (AA) meetings (Tr. 56). He remained sober from 1984, after the DUI arrest,\nthrough approximately 1995. Believing that he could manage drinking in moderation,\nApplicant resumed alcohol consumption. He defined moderation as, \u201ca beer here and\nthere to test . . . whether [he] was an alcoholic or not\u201d (Tr. 58). His alcohol resumption\ncorresponded with his decision to quit going to AA meetings (Tr. 51).\nBy approximately 2004, he was drinking four beers every other day (Id.). One\nevening in August 2006, two months after Applicant completed his security clearance\napplication (Exhibit 1), he had some beers and went to the barbershop. While returning\nhome in his car, he rounded a curve, oversteered, ran off the road, and sideswiped a\ntree (Tr. 52). Later the police arrived, administered a roadside sobriety test, arrested\nhim, and charged him with failure to control vehicle speed on a highway to avoid\ncollision, DUI, DUI per se, attempting to drive while impaired by alcohol, and negligent\ndriving (Tr. 53). His blood/alcohol content was .08 (Id.). In April 2007, he was found\nguilty, convicted, sentenced to one year in jail (all but two days suspended), and two\nyears of probation, and fined $500 (Answer). Also, he was required to install an ignition\ninterlock device on his automobile (Exhibit I).\nAs part of the court order, Applicant had to successfully complete alcohol\neducation and treatment (Exhibit G). He had already been receiving these services\nbefore the conviction, beginning in October 2006 (Exhibit 3 at 9). While in the program,\nhe self-diagnosed himself as alcohol-dependent (Id.). He finished the outpatient group\ntherapy on July 24, 2007, staying in the program \u201clong after he was required\u201d to attend\n(Exhibit H at 1).\nApplicant was also required to attend AA twice per week as a part of his\nprobation (Exhibit G). He is active in the program attending up to six meetings per week,\nand serving as a liaison with other regional AA groups (Exhibit G). He is involved in the\nmanagement of his AA group serving, at different times, as treasurer and secretary (Tr.\n\n3\n81-83). His duties have included, among other things helping to arrange speakers,\nconsolidate resources, and organize the annual AA softball game (Tr. 85). In addition,\nhe maintains a compendium of books and other literature on alcoholism that he has\nmade available to all of the AA groups in his region. He often attends AA meetings\noutside of the area where he lives to broaden his insight (Tr. 39). He has not drunk any\nalcohol since the 2006 DUI arrest, and has recently begun sponsoring other AA\nparticipants (Exhibit H at 2). \nApplicant attributes his relapse after a lengthy period of abstinence to a failure to\nthroughly embrace the AA principles, and to his mistaken belief that he could drink\nalcohol in moderation. Also, he used alcohol to avoid confronting his lack of emotional\nintimacy with his children. According to his wife, he is now much more involved with his\nchildren than he was earlier (Tr. 42). \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s therapist, the program director of the clinic where he\nreceived treatment:\n . . . it is very common for alcoholics to have a relapse after a long period\nof recovery. That relapse is very therapeutically viewed by counselors . . .\nas \u2018one last attempt in trying to be a social drinker.\u2019 The statistics show\nthat after one relapse, an alcoholic can accept one hundred percent that\nthey will never be a social drinker (nonalcoholic), and remain abstinent for\nthe rest of their lives. [Applicant] has gone through that process (Exhibit H\nat 1).\nMoreover, he characterized Applicant as \u201cone of the most careful, thorough, and\nmeticulous people that [he] had ever met (Id.), and concluded that his previous relapse\ndid not cast \u201ceven the slightest doubt\u201d (Id.) Regarding his reliability trustworthiness, and\njudgment. Applicant\u2019s probation officer characterized him as a cooperative, highly\nmotivated individual \u201cwho has changed his life, and is very committed to a sober life\u201d\n(Exhibit G). \nOn July 23, 2008, the court removed the ignition interlock requirement from the\nrequirements of his probation (Exhibit I). His probation expires in October 2009.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise\nof questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). Applicant\u2019s history of\nalcohol consumption and alcohol-related arrests triggers the application of AG \u00b6 22(a),\n\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or dependent.\u201d \nApplicant was not diagnosed with alcohol abuse or dependence by a medical\nprofessional. AG \u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence,\u201d does not apply. The clinic director where Applicant treated, however,\n\n5\nconcurred with Applicant\u2019s self-diagnosis of alcohol dependence. AG \u00b6 22(e),\n\u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker\nwho is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s 2006 DUI arrest occurred two months after the initiation of the\nsecurity clearance process. Also, it constituted a recurrence of past behavior.\nConsequently, it cannot be characterized as remote in time, and AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much\ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply.\nNevertheless, Applicant has abstained from alcohol since the arrest, and has\ndemonstrated a commitment to sobriety, exceeding the requirements of the 2006 court\norder, and engaging actively in AA both as a participant and a leader. I was troubled by\nthe recurrent nature of his conduct, particularly after a lengthy period of abstinence\nthrough the mid 1980s and early 1990s. Applicant\u2019s counselor, however, addressed this\nissue, and concluded that his relapse should not call into question his reliability and\ngood judgment. His probation officer made similar observations. Upon evaluating these\nrecommendations and the witness\u2019 testimony, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent), or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser),\u201d 23(d), \u201dthe\nindividual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation\nalong with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of\nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations,\nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization,\nand has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\n\n6\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nUpon evaluating the whole person factors, I conclude that the recent and\nrecurrent nature of Applicant\u2019s conduct is outweighed by the presence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes. His Application for a security clearance is\ngranted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In July 2007, he began working on the maintenance \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nplumbing crew for his current employer, a defense contractor. He needs a security \nclearance in order to have access to areas that contain classified information.  \n \n \nAfter high school, Applicant enlisted in the Navy reserves in September 1985 and \nreceived a general discharge in April 1987 after testing positive for marijuana.1 In \nAugust or September 1999, he was arrested and charged with (1) Possession of \nCannabis; (2) Firearm Owner\u2019s Identification Cards; and (3) Carrying a Firearm/Unlawful \nUse of Weapon. He pleaded guilty and was fined $1,000 plus court costs. He disclosed \nthe Cannabis and Carrying a Firearm charge under Question 23(f) of the August 2007 \nSF 86, and later addressed the marijuana charges during an October 2007 interview. \n(GE 2 at 68)  \n \n \nIn April 2003, Applicant and his girlfriend became embroiled in a domestic \nargument at his home after a concert. His girlfriend left the house, called the police, and \nfiled a complaint against him. The police did not arrest him that night, but issued an \narrest warrant. In October 2003, Applicant was stopped and arrested by the police on a \ncharge of Third Degree Domestic Assault, Third/Subsequent Offense (a felony). Upon \nsearching Applicant\u2019s car, the police found an unregistered gun that Applicant had \npurchased for protection because he lived in a dangerous neighborhood. He was taken \nto the police station and charged with Unlawful Use of Weapon, and Receiving Stolen \nProperty. His gun was confiscated and he stayed in jail for 24 hours before being \nreleased. After leaving the police station he never received any information about the \nincidents. Later, all of charges were later dismissed. (GE 3) He did not disclose the \nOctober 2003 charges under Question 23(a) because he did not know they existed until \nhe met with a Government investigator in October 2007. (Tr. 34) Applicant stated that \nhe \u201cwas not trying to mislead . . . but overlooked the question or I didn\u2019t read it properly.\u201d \n(Tr. 28) He told the investigator about the situation during his October 2007 interview. \n(Id.; GE 2) \n \n \nOn May 24, 2005, Applicant forcibly entered his girlfriend\u2019s house and began a \nphysical altercation with her. A neighbor telephoned the police and he left the residence \nbefore they arrived. On June 3, 2005, while the police were responding to a call to tow a \nwanted vehicle in his neighborhood, Applicant inquired about the vehicle and was \narrested on a Domestic Assault 3rd Degree and Burglary charges arising out of the May \n24, 2005 incident. He does not know why he was charged with burglary because he did \nnot steal anything. The charges were later dismissed. He disclosed the arrest for \nassault under Question 23(f) of the SF 86. (GE 1 at 127) He has not been arrested \nsince June 2005 or owned a gun since 2003. (Tr. 41) \n \n \nIn follow-up to an October 2007 interview with the Government about his \nanswers in the SF 86, Applicant completed Interrogatories in January 2008, specifically \naddressing previous drug use. In it, he disclosed that he purchased and used illegal \ndrugs, including marijuana, at least five or six times per year, from the late 1980\u2019s to \n                                            \n1Applicant discussed his discharge for marijuana use in an October 2007 interview with a \nGovernment investigator. (GE 2 at 68)  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\napproximately December 2004. In response to Question 8 on the Interrogatories \nregarding his initial failure to list his drug use on the SF 86, he wrote, \u201cI did. When I read \nthe question in Section 24 I miss interped (sic) the question. But I did include a charge \nfrom 1999 of cannabis.\u201d (GE 2 at 24)  While testifying, he elaborated on the issue \nstating that he did not have a specific reason for not disclosing it, as he had no intention \nof falsifying the SF 86. He thinks he was too overwhelmed at the time and in a hurry to \nfinish it because he was told to submit it within 20 days. It was the first time he filled out \nthe application and he had no help from his employer. He went to the library to complete \nit. (Tr. 29-30; 85) In discussing his past drug use, he admitted that he made poor \ndecisions. (Answer) He no longer associates with friends who smoke marijuana. (Tr. 36) \n \n \nDuring the October 2007 interview, Applicant told the investigator about a verbal \naltercation that occurred in September 2007 with his girlfriend. He wanted to be open \nwith the Government in the event any charges were filed later. (GE 2 at 69) At the \nhearing, he testified that he no longer is involved with that girlfriend. (Tr. 68)  \n \n \nFrom 1999 until 2004, Applicant helped support his girlfriend\u2019s two children, who \nlived nearby.2 When he filed his income tax returns for those years, he claimed them as \ndependent foster-children based on a conversation he had with someone at the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). (Tr. 31; 47-48) Applicant stated that he had a letter authorizing \nthe deduction for 1999, but did not produce it. During his October 2007 interview, he \ntold the investigator that the IRS notified him in 2004 that he owed $4,000 for the \ndisallowed deductions he took for the two children for several years, and subsequently \nthe IRS garnished his tax refunds for 2000 through 2004. (GE 2 at 70) \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2004 federal tax return in January 2005. He filed his 2005 and \n2006 federal returns in or about January 2008, well past the deadline. He attributed his \nlate filing to a philosophical difference and irritation with the IRS. (Tr. 52) As of the \nhearing, he owes about $2,770 in tax liability for the tax years of 1999, 2004 and 2005, \nand for \u201cLiabilities not shown,\u201d as noted on AE B.  In January 2008, his tax liability was \n$4,000. Since then, he has been making monthly payments of $237 on that outstanding \nbill. The record does not contain any evidence explaining the basis of the outstanding \nliability for any of those years. He asserted that he filed his 2007 federal returns and \npaid his taxes, but did not provide documentation to support his claim. (Tr. 64)  \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that over the years he has done plumbing work for \ncompanies, family and friends and did not report to the IRS the income he earned. (Tr. \n56-57) He understood he was required to report all of his income and will do so in the \nfuture.  (Tr. 71) \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted his Employee Performance Review for July 2007 to July \n2008. His supervisor gave him an overall rating of \u201c3\u201d out of a possible \u201c5.\u201d  (AE C) \n                                            \n2 On Form 8867, which is included in the 2004 federal tax return, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to \nQuestion 8 that asked whether the child for whom a deduction is being taken, resided with Applicant for \nover half of the year. (GE 2)  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nApplicant was candid about his previous arrests, drug use, and tax issues, albeit \nat times confusing about the details. He repeatedly stated that he was not trying to \nmislead the Government when he completed the SF 86, knowing that it had access to \nhis history. (Tr. 85) He stated: \n  \nI would just like to say I just feel like because of the things I went through, \nI feel like I\u2019m a better person. I just made some bad decisions and I\u2019m \nlooking forward to redeeming myself the next twenty-five or thirty years of \nmy life. Just being a better citizen and a better person.\u201d (Tr. 83-84) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant admitted that he has a history of criminal conduct allegations and \narrests: in 1987 he tested positive for marijuana; in 1999 he was arrested and convicted \nof carrying a firearm and possession of marijuana; in 2003 he was arrested for domestic \nassault, unlawful use of a weapon and receiving stolen property; in 2005 he was \narrested for domestic assault and burglary; and from 1987 to 2004, he used marijuana \nillegally. The evidence is sufficient to raise this disqualification. \nAfter the Government raised these security concerns, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut or produce evidence to prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 32 provides one \ncondition that could potentially mitigate security concerns under this guideline: \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in June 2005, almost four years ago. He \nhas not used marijuana since December 2004. There is no evidence of criminal \ncharges for the illegal use of drugs since 1999. Throughout this proceeding, he \nexpressed remorse about his criminal past and poor judgment. He submitted his \nmost recent job performance evaluation that indicates he is performing well and \nmeeting his supervisor\u2019s expectations. Hence, there is evidence of rehabilitation, \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nsuch that this mitigating condition is applicable to the allegations involving \ncriminal conduct, including the illegal use and purchase of marijuana.    \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement  \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 4: \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as \namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, \nstimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; and \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; and \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant admitted that he was discharged from the Navy in 1987 after testing \npositive for marijuana and that he used and purchased marijuana for approximately 17 \nyears, from the late 1980\u2019s until December 2004. He was also convicted of purchasing \nand possessing marijuana in 1999. The evidence is sufficient to raise said \ndisqualifications.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides one condition that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \nApplicant stopped using marijuana in December 2004, over four years ago. He \nrepeatedly acknowledged that he exercised poor judgment while using it. He appears \ncommitted to remaining abstinent. Hence, the evidence is sufficient to trigger a partial \napplication of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), but not its full application, because there is no independent \nevidence, such as random drug screenings or an evaluation from an appropriately \ncredentialed health care professional, to corroborate his assertion that he has not used \nmarijuana since December 2004. Such evidence is necessary, given his 17-year history \nof marijuana use. He no longer associates with the people with whom he previously \nused marijuana, which merits a limited application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), due to a lack of \nverification of his statements. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out \nin AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and maybe \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant falsified his answer to \nQuestion 23b: Your Police Record, in that he failed to disclose his October 2003 arrest \ninvolving a weapons charge. It alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b that in response to Question 23f: \nYour Police Record, he deliberately failed to disclose the 2005 burglary charge and the \n2003 assault and weapons charges. It further alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c that in response to \nQuestion 24a: Your Use of Illegal Drugs, he deliberately failed to disclose his illegal \ndrug use from the 1980\u2019s to 2004. The Government contended that those omissions \nmay raise a security concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a). Applicant denied \nthese allegations.  \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \nApplicant did not disclose the October 2003 charges because he was unaware of \nthe weapons charge. At the time of his arrest, the police stopped him based on an April \n2003 arrest warrant for a domestic incident. Because he had a gun in his car when \narrested, they also charged him with a weapons offense, unbeknownst to him. Because \nhe never went to court on any of the charges or received any additional information \nabout them, he did not realize that he was required to disclose them. Nor was he aware \nof the May 2005 burglary charge that had been filed against him when he was arrested \nin June 2005 on an assault offense. All of the 2003 and 2005 charges were later \ndismissed. Given his disclosure of the 1999 weapons and marijuana charges, and the \n2005 assault charge, his explanation is plausible and believable. \n \nApplicant admitted that he did not disclose his history of marijuana use in the SF \n86, which he subsequently detailed in a January 2008 interrogatory after an October \n2007 interview. He had no clear explanation for the specific omission, but knew he listed \nthe 1999 drug charges. During a follow-up interview, he explained the basis for his \ngeneral discharge from the Navy, relating to marijuana use, and the 1999 marijuana \ncharge. He also disclosed a recent September 2007 incident with his girlfriend in an \neffort to be forthcoming. \n \nApplicant asserted that he did not intentionally withhold any information, but felt \nrushed to complete the SF 86 (for the first time) and left out facts as a result. He did not \nreceive any assistance or guidance from his employer about the process. He knew the \nGovernment had access to his past and he would have no reason to hide information. \nDuring the October 2007 interview, he candidly discussed those issue raised by the \n\n \n \n \n \n10\ninvestigator. After reviewing the record and listening to him testify, Applicant\u2019s  \nexplanations for leaving information out of SF 86 regarding his police record and drug \nhistory are sufficiently credible, such that I find that the omissions were not                      \nintentional. Hence, the evidence does not establish deliberate falsification as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b and 1.c. These allegations are found in his favor.    \n \nIn addition to the above falsification allegations, the SOR alleged under this \nguideline issues pertaining to income taxes and a general discharge from the military. \nBased on the record, there is sufficient evidence to raise a potential disqualification \nunder AG \u00b6 16(c). Applicant asserted that he had authorization to take two children, \nwho did not live with him, as deductions on his income taxes for the years 1999 to 2004. \nIn 2004, he verified that they lived with him more than half of the year, despite testifying \nthat they lived nearby. Although he claimed he had a letter authorizing the deduction, at \nleast for 1999, he did not produce it. It appears that some of his current outstanding tax \nliabilities are related to the wrongfully claimed deductions, as he previously stated \nduring an interview. As a consequence of his interactions with the IRS subsequent to \nfiling his returns for 1999 through 2004, he deliberately failed to file his 2005 and 2006 \ntax returns and report other earned income. These tax issues, which were ongoing into \nJanuary 2008, when he decided to resolve them, coupled with his general discharge \nfrom the Navy for misconduct in 1987, constitute sufficient credible information in the \narea of finances and drugs, which when considered as a whole, demonstrate a lack of \ngood judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and indicate that \nhe may not properly safeguard protected information if he comes into contact with it.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 describes a condition that could mitigate the disqualification raised in \nthis case: \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nAlthough Applicant remorsefully acknowledged his wrongful behavior as it \npertains to his taxes and marijuana use, he did not produce any evidence to verify that \nhe is no longer involved with drugs, had authorization to take the child deductions or \nfiled his 2007 tax return on time and paid his taxes, as he testified. Hence, the above \ncondition is not applicable.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n11\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 42-year-old man, \nwhose past is blemished by a 17-year history of using marijuana, several arrests and \ntax issues, beginning in 1987 with a drug incident and spanning into January 2008 when \nhe filed tax returns that were several years late. In July 2007, he began his current \nposition as a plumber and recently earned a good job performance evaluation for his \nfirst year. While discussing his history, he candidly acknowledged his past problems and \nexpressed a desire to move forward and live a more productive life. His change of \nattitude is commendable. However, to-date he has not established a sufficient track \nrecord to assure the Government that similar problems will not recur in the future, in \nparticular maintaining abstinence from drugs and complying with income tax codes.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance at this time. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under criminal conduct and drug \ninvolvement, but not those concerns raised under personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n         AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.c:    \n           For Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.e:  \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.f \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n\n \n \n \n \n12\n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n   Subparagraph 2.a: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n   Subparagraph 2.b -2.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n   Subparagraphs 2.j \u2013 2.l:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n       AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n   Subparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.d:                  Against Applicant \n \n   \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 61 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant has a history of financial problems. The Applicant\u2019s financial affairs of the past include a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filed in May 27, 1997, which was dismissed on October 15, 1999.

This bankruptcy was discharged on April 12, 2005, after completion of the Chapter 13 plan. (See Government Exhibit 8). Applicant indicated that he was forced to file bankruptcy because in January 2000, his daughter and three grandchildren moved in with him causing financial hardship. He explained that as a result of a crisis, the youngest grandchild was left severely handicapped, and his oldest grandchild and daughter were in therapy for post traumatic stress syndrome.

Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 24, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) and his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) dated April 23,\n2007.  On April 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on a date uncertain, and on May\n12,  2008, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of\na hearing.   Department Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on May 28, 2008.  The Applicant was instructed to submit\ninformation in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant\nreceived the FORM on June 9, 2008, and he submitted no reply.  The case was\nassigned to the undersigned for resolution on September 15, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 61 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor, and is\napplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nApplicant has a history of financial problems.  The Applicant\u2019s financial affairs of\nthe past include a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filed in May 27, 1997, which was dismissed\non October 15, 1999.  (See Government Exhibit 7).  The reason for the dismissal is not\nin the record.  He again filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on October 21, 1999.  This\nbankruptcy was discharged on April 12, 2005, after completion of the Chapter 13 plan.\n(See Government Exhibit 8).  Applicant indicated that he was forced to file bankruptcy\nbecause in January 2000, his daughter and three grandchildren moved in with him\ncausing financial hardship.  He explained that as a result of a crisis, the youngest\ngrandchild was left severely handicapped, and his oldest grandchild and daughter were\nin therapy for post traumatic stress syndrome.  During this period, he did not pay his\nincome taxes because he needed the money to survive.  The Applicant claims that after\nhis daughter and grandchildren moved out in August 2006, he decided to clear up his\ndelinquent taxes. \nThe Applicant owes approximately $32,400.00 in unpaid taxes to the Federal and\nState tax authorities.  The IRS filed a tax lien against the Applicant for $31,756.00 for\nunpaid taxes due for years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2004.  On April 3, 2007,\nApplicant entered into a payment plan with the IRS to pay these taxes at $751.00 per\nmonth.  Applicant made three payments and stopped, because he could not afford the\npayments.  The IRS has applied tax returns totaling approximately $3,700.00 from tax\nyears 2005, 2006 and 2007 to Applicant\u2019s unpaid taxes.  The Applicant is not currently\nmaking any payments toward these back taxes.  The Applicant owes the State\napproximately $634.00 for tax year 2004.   The Applicant indicates that there have been\nsome adjustments to the amount owed based upon his 2007 income tax refund that was\napplied to the debt.  (See Government Exhibit 3, p. 2 and 9, and Exhibit 4).  He did not\nindicate how much of the debt was reduced, if any.        \nThe Applicant indicates that he has been in contact with a tax advocate to help\nlower the payment owed to the IRS and to clear up the tax lien.  Presently, the Applicant\nis not making any payments toward his outstanding federal tax debt.\nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement indicates that after paying his monthly\nexpenses without paying any of his delinquent debt, he has a negative remainder of\n$500.00.  (See Government Exhibit 6 at p. 28).  In his response to interrogatories dated\nFebruary 26, 2008, the Applicant provided no evidence to show that he has made any\npayments toward his state back taxes.  (See Government Exhibits 6).  \n\n3\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n4\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in financial difficulties that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in financial considerations (Guideline F).  The totality of this\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant\u2019s \u201ccrisis\u201d that he attributes to causing his financial difficulties was\nnot explained in sufficient detail to adequately mitigate his poor financial history.  The\nfact remains that the Applicant\u2019s delinquent unpaid Federal and State taxes have not\nbeen resolved.  Although he has made an attempt to seek help from a tax advocate, he\nremains indebted in excess of $30,000.00.  There is no payment plan in place.  Based\nupon the Applicant\u2019s salary and monthly expenses, there is no way that he can afford to\n\n5\npay his delinquent taxes.  He remains excessively indebted without a solution to his\nfinancial problems.  Under the circumstances, he has not made a good faith effort to\nresolve his indebtedness, and there is no evidence of financial rehabilitation.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nThe Applicant has not demonstrated that he can properly handle his financial affairs.\nThis Applicant has not paid and is currently not paying his delinquent taxes.  In this\nregard, he has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the eligibility\nrequirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \n   \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 for the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n\n6\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 27, 2007. On \nApril 11, 2008, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 21, 2008; answered it on \nMay 7, 2008; 2008, and requested an administrative determination without a hearing. \nBy email message on June 30, 2008, Applicant requested a hearing (Hearing Exhibit \n(HX II). Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 14, 2008, and the case was \nassigned to me on July 23, 2008. On the same day, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, \nscheduling the hearing for August 18, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nDD, which were admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of the \nhearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 27, 2008. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout the PRC and Taiwan (HX I). Without objection from Applicant, I took \nadministrative notice as requested by Department Counsel (Tr. 20-21). The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old assistant professor at a prestigious U.S. university and \na consultant on defense-related research. He was born and educated in the U.S., \nreceiving bachelor\u2019s degrees in discrete mathematics and computer science in 1997 \nand a doctorate in computer science in 2005. He worked as a research assistant at \nvarious institutions from 1996 to 2004, and he has been an assistant professor since \n2004. He has held an interim clearance in the past, but he has never been granted a \nfinal security clearance. \n \n \nAccording to a senior professor at Applicant\u2019s university, Applicant was a \u201crising \nstar\u201d when he was hired in 2004, and he now \u201ccommands the respect of peers and \nstudents alike.\u201d The professor states, \u201cWhen [Applicant] speaks faculty listen, even \nthose who have decades more experience.\u201d Applicant\u2019s wedding was attended by \u201ca \nliteral Who\u2019s Who in mobile computing research.\u201d He has a reputation as an ideal \nmentor and an \u201cincredibly hard worker,\u201d with high ethics and integrity (AX X).  \n \n \nA lifetime friend described Applicant as a reliable, trustworthy person of high \nmorals and ethics, who has always demonstrated good sense and judgment (AX Y). A \nfellow professor considers Applicant exceptionally talented, dedicated, creative, reliable, \nand hard-working (AX Z). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Taiwan. They both attended college in Taiwan \nand graduated in 1965. They came to the U.S. on a date not reflected in the record, and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis father obtained his Ph.D. from a U.S. university in 1973. They became U.S. citizens \nin June 1979. Applicant\u2019s mother is a retired accountant, drawing a pension from her \nemployment in the U.S. (Tr. 89). Applicant\u2019s father specializes in veterinary oncology. \nHe worked at the National Institutes of Health from 1977 to 1988 and taught at a \nmedical university. They returned to Taiwan in 1988 so that his father could accept a \nbetter-paying scientific research position and to be closer to Applicant\u2019s grandparents \n(Tr. 60; AX CC). He was an employee of the Taiwanese government from December \n1988 to June 1998, an adjunct university professor in Taiwan from December 1989 to \nJanuary 2008, an adjunct professor at a medical school in Taiwan from August 1995 to \nJanuary 2008, and has served on an advisory committee for the Taiwan government \nsince September 2003. Applicant\u2019s parents are financially independent (Tr. 63). \nApplicant\u2019s father submitted a statement promising that he will not request restricted or \nclassified information from his son (AX AA). \n \nAccording to Applicant, his parents are not politically active in Taiwan (Tr. 76). He \ndoes not believe they have decided whether they will return to the U.S. (Tr. 107-08); AX \nAA). He talks to his parents by telephone or email every two or three weeks (Tr. 105). \n \nApplicant and his brother are U.S. citizens, born while their parents were in the \nU.S. His brother also resides in the U.S., works as a hedge fund trader, and is \nindependently wealthy (Tr. 63-64; AX CC).  \n \n \nApplicant has three uncles and three aunts who are citizens and residents of \nTaiwan. One uncle is a retired colonel in the Taiwanese Army. Another uncle is a citizen \nof Taiwan who resided in the PRC while working in a Taiwanese-owned factory. He has \nsince returned to Taiwan (Tr. 66). \n \n \nApplicant has little contact with his Taiwanese relatives, because his ability to \nspeak Chinese is poor and his relatives speak little English. He sees them every two or \nthree years when he visits Taiwan, usually visiting them in a large family group (Tr. 65). \n \n \nApplicant married a citizen of the PRC in June 2006. She obtained her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in the PRC and entered the U.S. in 2001 on a student visa. Applicant met her \nthrough an on-line dating service in November 2004, while, she was a graduate student \nat a nearby university (Tr. 49). She obtained her doctorate in chemical engineering in \nMay 2007, and she is now performing post-doctoral research in nanotechnology for a \nnearby university (Tr. 79). She received her green card in January 2008 and intends to \nbecome a U.S. citizen (AX W; Tr. 75). She has no siblings (GX 2 at 13).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s friends describe his spouse as loving, devoted, kind, caring, and not a \nperson who would ask Applicant to compromise his values (AX Y and BB). His brother \nknows his spouse and believes she shares his values (AX CC). She did not testify at the \nhearing. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC. \nHis mother-in-law is a former factory supervisor but has no current income (Tr. 81). She \n\n \n4 \n \n \nvisited Applicant and his wife from March to May 2008. His father-in-law has been a \nprofessor at a publicly-funded university in the PRC for about 20 years and intends to \nretire in the near future, as soon as Applicant and his wife have children (Tr. 67). \nApplicant\u2019s wife talks to her parents by telephone at least once a week (Tr. 67). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s aunt, uncle, grandfather, and grandmother are citizens and \nresidents of the PRC. Her grandfather is an oncologist engaged in cancer research. He \nis near retirement and works only about one day a week (Tr. 69). Her aunt and uncle \nare pediatricians employed by the PRC government (Tr. 68). She also has a cousin who \nis a citizen and resident of the PRC and is employed as a low-level medical technician \nin a government hospital (Tr. 69). The record does not reflect how often Applicant\u2019s \nspouse contacts her extended family or the level of affection or obligation she feels for \nthem. \n \n \nApplicant owns stock worth about $3,000 in several PRC-based companies: a \nsearch engine company, an online game company, an outsourcing and telephone \nservices company, a telecom equipment company, and an index fund for foreign \ninvestments (AX M, N, and O). He testified he is losing money on these stocks and \nwould be willing to sell them to avoid any security concerns arising from them.  \n \nApplicant worked as a paid consultant for a PRC-based internet company in July \n2005, receiving $8,000 for presenting a three-day course on designing user interfaces. \nThe company focuses on online game services, advertising services, and value-added \nservices such as access to news and other information, downloading ring tones and \nlogos for mobile phones, and interactive games (AX I; Tr. 58-59). \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan in July 2005 and June 2008 to visit his family. He \ntraveled to the PRC in May 2001 to present a research paper at a conference in Hong \nKong, in February 2002 for a family vacation, in July 2005 to visit his in-laws for the first \ntime, and in June 2008 to visit his in-laws and present lectures at universities about his \ncurrent research. The visit to his in-laws in July 2005 coincided with his three-day \npresentation to the PRC-based internet company (Tr. 66). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s job requires frequent world-wide travel for business and conferences \n(Tr. 76). He takes his university-issued laptop with him, but he does not store any \nclassified information on his laptop (Tr. 104). He often is a panel member or a lecturer at \ninternational conferences (Tr. 100). His curriculum vitae lists his many publications, \nhonors, and research grants, including grants from the National Science Foundation \nand the Department of Defense (AX S). He frequently receives unsolicited email from \nPRC students who want to come to the U.S. and participate in his \u201ccutting edge\u201d \ncomputer science research (Tr. 103). He participates in collaborative research with \nother institutions, but he has not been invited to collaborate with any university faculty \nmembers in the PRC or Taiwan (Tr. 103). \n \n \nApplicant is politically active in the U.S., votes in every election, and contributes \nto a political party (AX T, U, and V; Tr. 74). He owns his home, worth about $490,000, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand he earns a gross annual salary of more than $116,000. He has about $153,000 in \ninvestments, $36,000 in a money market account, and an average balance in his \nchecking account of about $6,000 (Tr. 53; AX A through H).  \n \n \nApplicant testified he achieved his current position by years of hard work and his \nreputation for honesty, trustworthiness, and reliability (Tr. 42-43, 48). He testified he \nwould not be a good intelligence target because of his longstanding ties to the U.S. and \nhis low opinion of the PRC government. He cited the protests at Tiananmen Square as \na \u201cdefining moment\u201d of his youth and one of the reasons he would never consider \nhelping the PRC government (Tr. 72).  \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts. The PRC has an \nauthoritarian government dominated by the Communist Party. It has large and \nincreasingly sophisticated military forces. The U.S. and the PRC have been rivals since \nthe Cold War, with particular disagreement on Taiwan.  Despite political disagreements, \nthe U.S. and the PRC have become major economic and trading partners. The PRC is \none of the most aggressive practitioners of industrial espionage, targeting sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology and military information with its worldwide intelligence \noperations, including those in Taiwan. U.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry are considered \nprime intelligence targets. The PRC\u2019s approach to intelligence collection differs \nsubstantially from the U.S. or Russian approach. The PRC\u2019s approach is focused less \non exploiting a perceived vulnerability and more on appealing to an individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp the PRC. Although the PRC has a large professional intelligence apparatus, a \nsignificant portion of its collection efforts are conducted directly by students, \ndelegations, and commercial enterprises, who do not attempt to acquire information \ndirectly, but simply identify what information is needed and invite knowledgeable \nindividuals to make reciprocal visits to the PRC. The PRC relies on collecting small \namounts of information from many people. It attempts to recruit or at least befriend as \nmany PRC sympathizers as possible. PRC intelligence agents use social or \nprofessional situations to elicit indiscrete or inadvertent disclosures of sensitive \ninformation. \n \nI have also taken administrative notice that the PRC has a poor human rights \nrecord. It suppresses political dissent, and it practices arbitrary arrest and detention, \nforced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. Travelers to the PRC can \nexpect to be placed under surveillance, with their hotel rooms, telephones, and fax \nmachines monitored and personal possessions, including computers, searched without \ntheir knowledge or consent. PRC intelligence agents use sophisticated technology to \nbreak commercial code systems used to encrypt data on laptop computers. \n \n \nFinally, I have taken administrative notice that Taiwan is a multi-party democracy, \nestablished as a separate, independent government by refugees from mainland China \nin 1949. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s \nindependence and insists there is only one China. The U.S. recognized Taiwan as an \nindependent government until January 1979, when it formally recognized the PRC \ngovernment as the sole legal government of China. Taiwan has developed a strong \n\n \n6 \n \n \neconomy and has significant economic contacts with the PRC, but it also maintains a \nlarge military establishment to protect itself from the PRC. For many years, Taiwan has \nbeen an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence, and there have been numerous \ninstances of efforts to export sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s wife, father-in-law, and mother-in-law are citizens \nand residents of the PRC (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and b); his father-in-law is a PRC government \nemployee working as a professor at a university in the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and his wife\u2019s \ngrandfather, grandmother, aunt, uncle, and cousin are citizens and residents of the PRC \nand her cousin works in a government hospital (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m). It also alleges \nApplicant\u2019s parents are dual U.S.-Taiwanese citizens and reside in Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 1.d); \nhis father has been employed by the Taiwanese government in several positions (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1e-1.h); his three uncles and three aunts are citizens and residents of Taiwan (SOR \n\u00b6 1.j); one uncle is a retired colonel in the Taiwanese Army (SOR \u00b6 1.k); and one uncle \nis a Taiwanese citizen residing in the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.n). It further alleges Applicant owns \nstock worth about $3,000 in three PRC-based companies and was a paid consultant for \na PRC-based company in July 2005 (SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.o and p). Finally, it alleges Applicant \ntraveled to the PRC in May 200a, February 2002, July 2005, and June 2008 and \ntraveled to Taiwan in July 2004 and June 2008 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q and r). \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \nFour disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, \na disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). Third, a security \nconcern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or \npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). When family \nmembers are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as \nwell as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). Finally, a security concern also may be raised by \u201ca \nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any \nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s three-day training course for a PRC-based company in July 2005 \ninvolved subject matter often targeted by PRC intelligence-gathering activities. Although \nApplicant held an interim clearance for some period in the past, the record does not \nreflect whether he held a clearance before or at the time of his three-day presentation. \nWhile Applicant was at risk during the three-day period, his association with the \ncompany ended in July 2005 and does not raise any current \u201cheightened risk\u201d of \nexploitation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of the PRC. Her parents reside in the PRC, and \nher father is associated with a university in the PRC, a common conduit for intelligence \ngathering. A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has not \nrebutted this presumption. It appears that Applicant has little contact with his wife\u2019s \ngrandparents, aunt, uncle and cousin, and his wife\u2019s contact is primarily with her \nparents. Applicant\u2019s parents are U.S. citizens, but appear to prefer living in Taiwan. His \nfather is a government employee and associated with two universities. He has three \naunts and three uncles in Taiwan, one of whom is a retired Taiwanese Army colonel. \nWhile some of Applicant\u2019s family ties with his extended family and his wife\u2019s extended \nfamily, standing alone, might not create the \u201cheightened risk\u201d at issue under this \nguideline, I conclude that the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to two countries that target \nthe U.S. for intelligence gathering are sufficient to raise the \u201cheightened risk\u201d within the \nmeaning of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (d), and a potential conflict interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). \nAccordingly, I conclude the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) are \nraised. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s investment in PRC-based companies was not based on any affinity \nfor the PRC, but was made simply as an investment strategy. The amount of his \ninvestment, compared to his entire portfolio and his other assets, is small, and he is \nwilling to sell his stocks to eliminate any security concerns. Considering his net worth, \nthe size of his entire investment portfolio, and his willingness to dispose of it, I conclude \nhis $3,000 investment in PRC-based companies is insufficient to raise a \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d under AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to the PRC and Taiwan was either to visit family members, to \nwork as a paid consultant, or to participate in conferences in connection with his \nteaching and consulting work at the university. It has no independent security \nsignificance. See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise AG \u00b6 7(a), (b), and \n(d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant is close to his parents and his wife is close to hers. Both \nthe PRC and Taiwan target the U.S. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). His \n\n \n10 \n \n \nloyalty and sense of obligation to his parents is not minimal, nor is his loyalty, affection \nand sense of obligation to his wife and her parents. Applicant has lived his entire life in \nthe U.S. and has a strong attachment to the U.S., but his wife is a relative newcomer to \nthe U.S. and is not yet a citizen. His parents\u2019 ties to the U.S. are uncertain. I am not \nconvinced that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the interests of the \nU.S. This is a close case, but Applicant has the burden of proof, and he has not carried \nthat burden. Doubtful cases must be resolved in favor of national security. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \nApplicant has not rebutted this presumption for the contacts with his parents. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a relatively young, very intelligent, well-educated adult. He is a \nbrilliant computer scientist. He is internationally known as a leader in \u201ccutting edge\u201d \ncomputer science research. His curriculum vitae is extensive and widely circulated, and \nit lists funding by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense. He \ntestified he receives email inquiries from students in the PRC seeking to participate in \nhis research. He regularly participates in international conferences. While his brilliance \nand dedication offer much to the Department of Defense, his reputation makes him an \nattractive intelligence target, and his participation in numerous seminars and \n\n \n11 \n \n \nconferences makes him vulnerable to an unguarded off-hand comment or inadvertent \ndisclosure.  \n \n \nApplicant has been married for a relatively short time, and his relationships with \nhis wife and her family are still evolving. Her connections to the PRC are deep and \nstrong, but Applicant believes his wife\u2019s devotion to him and their shared values would \nresolve any conflict of interests in his favor.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are ambivalent about where they wish to reside permanently. \nHis father and father-in-law both work in academia, a venue often exploited by the PRC \nfor intelligence purposes. \n \n \nApplicant was candid and sincere at the hearing. His reputation for reliability and \nintegrity are impeccable. He is justifiably proud of his prominent position at a prestigious \nuniversity, enthusiastic about his \u201ccutting edge\u201d research, and enjoys collaborating and \nsharing his research with other institutions. He has spent all his adult life in the \nacademic world. He believes he can and would resist any attempts at exploitation, but I \nam not convinced he has acquired the savvy to recognize sophisticated exploitation \nwhen it happens. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.r: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 45-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since March 2006. He received a clearance in February 1986 and held it for about two years (Tr. 55). He submitted his e-QIP because his current job requires a clearance (Tr. 56). Applicant\u2019s performance appraisals from June 2006 to December 2007 uniformly rated him as \u201csuccessful,\u201d the middle category in a five-category scale ranging from exceptional to unsatisfactory (AX G, H, I, and J). One of Applicant\u2019s colleagues, who worked with him for two years on a daily basis, described him as an excellent engineer. They socialized frequently, but the witness was unaware that Applicant had problems with alcohol. He testified Applicant was \u201calways a professional\u201d and never came to work under the influence of alcohol (Tr. 23-27; AX B). Another of Applicant\u2019s colleagues described him as an experienced, skilled, dedicated engineer (AX A). A long-time friend of 25 years regards him as honest, loyal, hardworking, and trustworthy (AX D). Applicant began consuming alcohol in 1978 (GX 2 at 1). He underwent detoxification for alcohol abuse around 1994 (GX 3 at 1). He completed a 10-day in- patient rehabilitation program in 1997, was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, and abstained from alcohol for five years (Tr. 73-74).

Edmunds, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on June 15, 2007. \nOn April 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline G. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 9, 2008; answered it on May \n19, 2008; denied all the allegations in the SOR; and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request by facsimile transmission on May 19, \n2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 12, 2008, and the case was \nassigned to me on June 13, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 29, 2008, \nscheduling the hearing for August 27, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf, presented the testimony of two witnesses, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through J, which were admitted without objection. \nThe record closed upon adjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non September 11, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since March 2006. He received a clearance in February 1986 and \nheld it for about two years (Tr. 55). He submitted his e-QIP because his current job \nrequires a clearance (Tr. 56). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals from June 2006 to December 2007 uniformly \nrated him as \u201csuccessful,\u201d the middle category in a five-category scale ranging from \nexceptional to unsatisfactory (AX G, H, I, and J). \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s colleagues, who worked with him for two years on a daily \nbasis, described him as an excellent engineer. They socialized frequently, but the \nwitness was unaware that Applicant had problems with alcohol. He testified Applicant \nwas \u201calways a professional\u201d and never came to work under the influence of alcohol (Tr. \n23-27; AX B). Another of Applicant\u2019s colleagues described him as an experienced, \nskilled, dedicated engineer (AX A). A long-time friend of 25 years regards him as \nhonest, loyal, hardworking, and trustworthy (AX D). \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol in 1978 (GX 2 at 1). He underwent \ndetoxification for alcohol abuse around 1994 (GX 3 at 1). He completed a 10-day in-\npatient rehabilitation program in 1997, was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, and \nabstained from alcohol for five years (Tr. 73-74).  \n \nApplicant resumed his alcohol consumption in 2002, thinking he could drink \nagain without problems, but his consumption gradually increased to about 12-15 beers \nper day. He was admitted to a hospital in September 2004, diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent, given detoxification treatment, and was released the next day (GX 3 at 1-4).  \n \n \nIn October 2004, Applicant was taken to the hospital emergency room because \nhe started shaking violently and vomiting as the result of heavy drinking the previous \nnight. He was discharged after about five hours (GX 3 at 17-29). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn November 2004, Applicant resigned from a job with another defense \ncontractor after being accused of consuming alcohol at work. He took a breathalyzer \ntest, registering .02, and claimed the alcohol was still in his system from the previous \nnight\u2019s drinking (GX 6 at 1-2). \n \n \nIn March 2006, police went to Applicant\u2019s residence to investigate a report that \nan emotionally disturbed person was on the premises. When the police arrived, \nApplicant told them he was an alcoholic and needed treatment. The police transported \nhim to a local hospital for evaluation. He was diagnosed as an alcoholic, received \ndetoxification treatment in the emergency room, and was released after several hours \n(GX 3 at 7-16).  \n \n \nFrom July 2006 to October 2007, Applicant consulted with a licensed clinical \nsocial worker and a psychiatrist about once a month. They diagnosed him as suffering \nfrom anxiety, insomnia, and alcoholism. They advised him to reduce or stop his alcohol \nconsumption, and recommended attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. \nHe stopped consuming alcohol for about three months beginning in September 2006. In \nOctober 2007, he was administered a breathalyzer test by his employer, based on \nreasonable suspicion, and the test apparently was negative (AX F). He resumed his \nconsumption of alcohol in December 2007 (GX 1 at 28; GX 2 at 4 and 8-19; GX 6 at 1). \n \n \nIn December 2007, Applicant went to an AA meeting with a hangover, and his AA \nfriends took him to an alcohol dependency treatment center (Tr. 64). He was diagnosed \nwith alcohol dependence with physiological dependence and obsessive compulsive \ndisorder. He was discharged after one day because he declined to sign a release \nallowing his employer or medical doctor to know he was in detoxification treatment (GX \n5). He testified he left the treatment center against medical advice, because he went to \nthe center for detoxification only and did not think he needed a rehabilitation program \n(Tr. 69). He admitted he did not want his employer to know about his alcohol problem \n(Tr. 70). \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories, stating he \nconsumed alcohol to the point of intoxication (blood-alcohol content greater than .04) \nfour evenings per week, and that he had been attending AA meetings twice a week \nsince 2006 (GX 2 at 1-2).  \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant did not come to work for several days and had not \nnotified his supervisor of his intended absence. His supervisor called the county sheriff\u2019s \noffice. A sheriff was dispatched to his home and found him sitting in a chair with beer \ncans and prescription drugs containers scattered around him. Applicant was taken to \nthe hospital for treatment (GX 7). Applicant testified this incident is when he \u201chit bottom,\u201d \nwhen his situation became so out of control that continued consumption of alcohol was \nnot an option (Tr. 59-60). He talked to a person in the employee assistance program at \nhis workplace, who recommended that he stop drinking completely (Tr. 62). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nOn June 13, 2008, Applicant\u2019s AA sponsor took him to a chemical dependency \ntreatment center that was recommended by their employee assistance program (Tr. 49-\n50). Applicant successfully completed the treatment program and was discharged on \nJuly 3, 2008, with recommendations that he attend AA meetings daily for 90 days, \nobtain an AA home group and sponsor within 30 days, and utilize the treatment center\u2019s \ncontacts and support staff (AX E). \n \n \nApplicant testified that he had been consuming alcohol for about 20 years and \nabusing alcohol regularly for about 10 years. He engaged in binge drinking, sometimes \nconsuming 12 to 24 bottles of beer a day. He suffered an alcoholic seizure in July 2006, \nand experienced periods of blackouts (Tr. 66-67).  \n \nApplicant last consumed alcohol in April 2008, the day the sheriff found him at \nhome. He now attends AA meetings daily. Applicant\u2019s AA sponsor for the past six \nmonths works for the same employer and interacts with Applicant daily. He believes \nApplicant is doing \u201cquite well\u201d in AA. He takes it seriously and participates in AA \ncommittees providing community service (Tr. 36-46; AX C). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was consuming alcohol four times a week as of the \ndate of the SOR (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he resigned from a previous job in November 2004 after \nregistering .02 BAC on an employer-administered breathalyser (SOR \u00b6 1.b); he received \nalcohol detoxification in September 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); he was treated for alcohol-related \nsymptoms in October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); he was taken to a hospital for evaluation after \ncalling the police to his residence, announcing he was an alcoholic, and asking for \ntreatment in March 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); he consulted with a licensed clinical social worker \nfrom June to October 2006 about alcohol withdrawal (SOR \u00b6 1.f); he was evaluated and \ndiagnosed with alcohol dependence and obsessive compulsive disorder in December \n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); he was attending AA meetings twice a week as of January 22, 2008 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h); and he missed work in April 2008 and was found at home by a county \nsheriff, surrounded by beer cans and prescription drug containers (SOR \u00b6 1.i). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \n\n \n6 \n \n \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant\u2019s call for police assistance in \nMarch 2006, and his discovery by a county sheriff at home in an intoxicated condition in \nApril 2008 after failing to come to work for several days are \u201cincidents of concern\u201d within \nthe meaning of AG \u00b6 22(a).  \n \nA disqualifying condition also may arise from \u201calcohol-related incidents at work, \nsuch as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on \nthe job, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(b). There is no evidence Applicant was intoxicated or \nimpaired when his employer administered the breathalyzer in November 2004, and no \nevidence of drinking on the job; however, the enumerated \u201cincidents\u201d in this \ndisqualifying condition are illustrative and not exclusive. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \ncondition at work, with a blood alcohol level of .02 as a result of the previous night\u2019s \nconsumption, is an \u201calcohol-related incident at work\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6 22(b). \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c). \u201cBinge drinking\u201d is \n\u201cthe consumption of five or more drinks in a row on at least one occasion.\u201d  U.S. Dept. \nof Health & Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, The  National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Binge Drinking Among \nUnderage Persons, Apr. 11, 2002, available at  http://www.oas.samhsa.gov. Applicant\u2019s \nhistory, including consumption of as much as 12 to 24 bottles of beer in a day, raises \nthis disqualifying condition.  \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised either by \u201cdiagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d or by \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(d) and (e). The record does not reflect the \ndiagnosis accompanying Applicant\u2019s detoxification in 1994, but he was diagnosed as \nalcohol dependent in 1997. He was twice diagnosed as having \u201calcoholism\u201d in 2006. \n\u201cAlcoholism\u201d is \u201cchronic alcohol abuse, dependence, or addiction.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical \nDictionary at 44 (26th ed. 1995). The term \u201calcoholism\u201d does not appear in DSM IV.  In \nprevious versions of the DSM, it was synonymous with alcohol dependence. Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnoses of alcohol dependence in 1997 and September 2004, \u201calcoholism\u201d in 2006; \nand alcohol dependence in December 2007 raise both of these disqualifying conditions. \n \nFinally, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201crelapse after diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 22(f). Applicant completed a 10-day alcohol rehabilitation program in 1997, \nmaintained sobriety for five years, and then relapsed. The evidence indicates all of \nApplicant\u2019s treatments between 1997 and December 2007 were for detoxification and \ndid not include an alcohol rehabilitation program. He entered a rehabilitation program in \nDecember 2007 but left after one day. He completed an in-patient rehabilitation program \n\n \n7 \n \n \nin July 2008 and had not relapsed as of the date of the hearing. Based on Applicant\u2019s \nrelapse in 2002 after completing an alcohol rehabilitation program in 1997, I conclude \nAG \u00b6 22(f) is raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) through (f), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). The first prong of this \nmitigating condition focuses on the recentness of the conduct. There are no Abright line@ \nrules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a \ncareful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last drinking binge was in April 2008, and he abstained from that date \nuntil the hearing in August 2008. Considered in the context of his long history of alcohol \nabuse, including a five-year period of abstinence ending in 2002 and a three-month \nperiod ending in December 2007, his four-month period of abstinence is not a significant \nperiod of time. Thus, I conclude his alcohol abuse is recent. It also was frequent and did \nnot happen under unusual circumstances. Given his history and short period of \nabstinence, I cannot determine the likelihood of recurrence. His record of alcohol abuse \ncasts doubt on his current reliability and trustworthiness. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). Applicant has \nacknowledged his alcohol dependence and completed an alcohol treatment program, \nbut he has not yet established a \u201cpattern\u201d of abstinence within the meaning of this \nmitigating condition. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual is a \ncurrent employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no \nhistory of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n23(c). Applicant completed the in-patient phase of his treatment in July 2008, but at the \ntime of the hearing he had not completed the aftercare requirement of attending AA \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmeetings daily for 90 days. He was complying with all program requirements as of the \ndate of the hearing. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(c) is established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(d). As noted above, Applicant had not completed his required \naftercare at the time of the hearing, and there is no evidence of a prognosis. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 23(d) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, intelligent adult. He appears to have \nrealized in April 2008 that he \u201chit bottom,\u201d and he has taken aggressive action to \naddress his alcohol abuse. He was candid and sincere at the hearing. He is headed in \nthe right direction, but not enough time has elapsed to determine whether he will \nmaintain sobriety and gain control of his alcohol dependence. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline G, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated September 4, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.l of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 57 years old, has a high school degree, is married to his third wife, and has two children from his prior marriages. His children are all adults. Applicant has been a truck driver for the past 18 years. Some of the cargo he hauled until his stroke was for the Defense Department (DoD). In July 2008, he had a mild stroke, and now has high blood pressure. Under U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) rules, he cannot drive a truck again until at least July 2009. His employer removed his DoD qualifications at the same time. He had no adverse situations while hauling DoD cargo. When he was driving with his wife, who is also a truck driver and has a security clearance, they could earn about $5,000 monthly. Now, with just his wife driving the truck because he cannot drive under the DOT rules, they earn about $2,000 monthly. He and his wife support a daughter who has five minor children and is unable to work because of medical conditions. Applicant spends about $1,200 monthly to rent an apartment and pay for a truck for the daughter. Applicant and his wife have no permanent home, but live in their truck\u2019s l",

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn January 28, 2005, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 3, 2008.  He \nanswered the SOR in writing on September 4, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. I received the case assignment on October 9, 2008. DOHA issued \na Notice of Hearing on October 20, 2008, setting the hearing for November 7, 2008.  I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay because his truck broke down and he could not \nget to the hearing.  On November 18, 2008, I entered an order setting the continued \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing no later than January 21, 2009.  Another Notice of Hearing was issued on \nJanuary 12, 2009, setting the rescheduled hearing for January 27, 2009.  I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on that day. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A \nthrough N, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nFebruary 9, 2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February \n10, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On that day, he submitted Exhibits O to S, \nwithout objection. The record closed on February 10, 2009. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 4, 2008, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k of the SOR, with \nexplanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.l of the SOR. He \nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance.   \n \nApplicant is 57 years old, has a high school degree, is married to his third wife, \nand has two children from his prior marriages.  His children are all adults.  Applicant has \nbeen a truck driver for the past 18 years.  Some of the cargo he hauled until his stroke \nwas for the Defense Department (DoD). In July 2008, he had a mild stroke, and now \nhas high blood pressure.  Under U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) rules, he \ncannot drive a truck again until at least July 2009. His employer removed his DoD \nqualifications at the same time.  He had no adverse situations while hauling DoD cargo.  \nWhen he was driving with his wife, who is also a truck driver and has a security \nclearance, they could earn about $5,000 monthly.  Now, with just his wife driving the \ntruck because he cannot drive under the DOT rules, they earn about $2,000 monthly.  \nHe and his wife support a daughter who has five minor children and is unable to work \nbecause of medical conditions.  Applicant spends about $1,200 monthly to rent an \napartment and pay for a truck for the daughter.  Applicant and his wife have no \npermanent home, but live in their truck\u2019s living compartment, because they are \nconstantly on the highway to earn money from their truck. His prior truck was destroyed \nin an accident in 2000, which started Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and the stroke \ncompounded them. (Tr. 14, 24, 25, 26, 28-37, 61; Exhibits 1, D) \n \nApplicant submitted pictures of his truck, decorated to show his support for the \nU.S. Armed Forces.  He also submitted letters from his trucking company supervisors \nand a person who knows him because both their children are in the military together.  \nAll state Applicant is an honest, hardworking man of integrity who provides excellent \ntrucking services to his customers. (Tr. 27; Exhibits A-C) \n \nThe SOR lists 12 delinquent debts, totaling about $87,000.  Five of the debts \nhave been paid, while the remainder are unpaid.  The two largest groups of debts are \nmedical expenses for himself and his wife, and credit card debts.  Applicant also was \n\n \n3 \n \n \npaying some debts, but when he had his stroke and could not drive, his income dropped \nby over 50% and he could not maintain the payment programs. (Tr. 38-56; Exhibits 2-6, \nE to S) \n \nApplicant paid the following debts: a telephone debt of $956 on December 8, \n2006 (\u00b6 1.a); $254 to a bank on a gasoline credit card on or before May 21, 2008 (\u00b6 1.f); \n$73,883 on a mobile home debt by a warranty deed in lieu of foreclosure on April 28, \n2003; and $1,477 on a credit card debt on March 30, 2007 (\u00b6 1.l).  While those debts \nremain on Applicant\u2019s credit record, his documents show they have been resolved.  \nApplicant has not been diligent in having his credit record reflect the payments or \nresolution of these debts. (Tr. 38, 43, 44-46; Exhibits 2-6, F, H, K, and S) \n \nApplicant owes the following medical debts: $287 (\u00b6 1.b); $99 (\u00b6 1.c); $69 (\u00b6 1.d); \n$192 (\u00b6 1.i); and $75 for a medical debt for his wife (\u00b6 1.j).  These debts have not been \npaid because they were small and Applicant overlooked them as he drove around the \nUnited States in his truck. (Tr. 39-41, 50, 51, 56; Exhibits 2-6) \n \nThe two credit card debts Applicant owes are: $550 as listed in the SOR, but now \nthe balance is $300 after Applicant made some payments which he had to cease \nbecause his income decreased last year (\u00b6 1.e); and $396 after making payments until \nabout eight months ago (\u00b6 1.h).  Applicant\u2019s exhibit shows he entered an installment \npayment agreement on February 4, 2009, for $50 each month on a new balance of \n$487.60 on this debt. (Tr. 41-43, 48; Exhibits 2-6, O)  \n \nThe delinquent debt in \u00b6 1.k of the SOR is for $8,767, owed on a car for which \nApplicant co-signed the note.  The car was for his daughter with the five children.  He \nwas making payments on the debt until July 2008 when he had his stroke, and could not \ndrive and earn as much as he was while driving.  The car was repossessed by the \nlender, sold at auction, and the $8,767 balance owed remains.  The original amount \nwas $16,289.54.  He was paying $100 to $200 monthly on the debt. (Tr. 51, 52; Exhibits \n2-6, I) \n \nApplicant\u2019s repayment plan for his debts is to pay the medical debts first, then the \nsmaller debts, and working up to the car loan debt.  Applicant also owes Federal income \ntaxes for the years 2004 to 2006.  He filed his returns, but did not have the money to \npay the taxes.  As an independent contractor, he did not withhold sufficient money to \npay his taxes.  His employer did not have to withhold any tax payments because of the \ncontractual arrangement between them.  Applicant was paying the taxes pursuant to an \ninstallment agreement until his stroke.  He currently owes $38,348.65, according to his \nexhibit, but thinks he owes about $13,000 because of lower income they earned in later \nyears which may earn them a refund, and the mistakes made by his tax preparer for the \nrelevant tax years. These tax debts do not appear on the Government exhibits which \nare credit reports, dated for 2005, 2008, and 2009.  (Tr. 56; Exhibits 2, 3, 5, 6, R) \n \nApplicant submitted two exhibits to show he has paid four other debts not listed \nin the SOR.  He paid a mortgage on another property, a credit card debt of $45, a \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmedical bill for about $226 in 2006, and a telephone bill on July 31, 2006.  He has \npayment agreements on two other debts not listed in the SOR.  He owes a hospital bill \nof $500 and had paid down the debt starting in 2007.  He will resume payments in \nFebruary 2009 of $100 monthly.  He owes $305.57 on a credit card and made a $50 \npayment on January 31, 2009, and every month thereafter. He has not incurred new \ndebt in the past year. (Exhibits G, L, M, N, P and Q)    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some \nobligations since 2000 after his truck accident.  He owes seven delinquent debts listed \nin the SOR. The first six smallest of these debts total $1,022.  The seventh debt is for \nthe unpaid balance on a car purchased for his daughter, being $8,767.  The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer \nexamination. \n \nAfter analyzing Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and his actions to date to resolve \nthem, they are actually less than would appear on the SOR. For example, Applicant \nowes only $1,022 on the smallest six debts, an amount which he could pay without any \ndifficulty, and to which he committed to paying.  Then he would have the next largest \ndebt to pay, which would be the car loan balance of $8,767. \n \nApplicant admitted two groups of debts not listed on the SOR which he is paying \nto show his good-faith efforts at paying his overall debt obligations.  Applicant is paying \nthe $1,200 in small debts.  Finally, Applicant has only the Federal tax debt to pay when \nhe resumes his installment payment agreement. That amount seems to be in dispute \nbetween Applicant and the Internal Revenue Service. That agreement and other \ninstallment payment agreements were interrupted when he lost income after his July \n2008 stroke.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nHis financial support of his daughter and her five children in the amount of $1,200 \nmonthly from his current $2,000 monthly income also has adversely affected his ability \nto pay his debts.  When he resumes driving after July 2009, he can earn more money, \nwhich should make it easier for him to repay his debts.  He should have the paid debts \nremoved from his credit reports so his credit report will not reflect resolved debts and \nlook worse than it actually is.   \n \nSpecifically, the guideline also includes examples of conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the \ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose sometime after 2000. They became \naggravated when he could not drive and earn the income he formerly earned.  He \naccumulated delinquent debt due to support for his daughter and grandchildren and his \nunemployment under Federal rules as a long haul truck driver. These circumstances \ncontinue, and will for the foreseeable future regarding his daughter and her family. I find \nthe behavior occurred under some unusual circumstances, but it is likely to recur.   \nHowever, because of the unique combination of events, it does not raise concerns \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment based on his \nperformance record and the character statements. The evidence raises this potentially \npartially mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, the \nfinancial problems arose from his 2000 truck accident, and then his medical problems of \nthe stroke and high blood pressure compounded them by causing the lengthy current \nperiod of unemployment as a truck driver under DOT rules. He acted responsibly in \nresolving five of these debts before the SOR was issued. He is trying to pay the \nremaining delinquent debts within his financial capacity. I find this potentially mitigating \ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis not present; hence the potentially mitigating condition under AG & 20(c) is not \napplicable.  \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has \nbeen resolving delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement, while supporting \nhimself, his wife, and six other people. If he were earning the income he earned up to \nJuly 2008, he would now be financially sound and prepared for future contingencies.  \nBecause of his continuing efforts to pay his debts, even while traveling as a truck driver, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand not incurring any new substantial debt, I conclude this potentially mitigating \ncondition applies. \n \nThe two remaining mitigating conditions, legitimate reasons to contest a debt, \nand affluence resulting from a legal source of income, do not apply to this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant has a health problem \nwhich prevents him from earning his former income, with which he could easily resolve \nthese debts.  All but one of the SOR listed debts currently unpaid total only $1,022, a \nminiscule amount of debt.  The remaining large debt is $8,767 for the car loan.  Of the \nSOR listed debt total of about $87,000, Applicant has resolved nearly $77,000 worth of \ndelinquent debt. He is paying other unlisted debts on the installment basis, which debts \ntotal about $1,200. These payment efforts show his good-faith and continued \ncommitment to repaying his delinquent debts. The debts are manageable if his former \nincome were to be restored.  Applicant has applied himself to paying his debts, but is \nlimited by his health, which is not his fault.  His stroke limits his ability to earn sufficient \nincome to pay all the debts more rapidly than he is doing so.  He has not incurred new \ndelinquent debt during this period.  He did not voluntarily spend himself into the current \nsituation.  There is no potential for pressure or coercion, because it was not wanton \nspending which placed Applicant in this situation.  Once he resumes his driving career, \nand keeps his truck moving and earning income, he can resolve his remaining debts. \nWhen hauling the DoD cargoes in the past, Applicant had no adverse situations or \nreports.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",
