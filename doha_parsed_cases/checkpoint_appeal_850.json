Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nScott D. Walters, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 14, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing which was held on February 27, 2024. On March 6, \n2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged two concerns under Guideline J which were cross-alleged under \nGuideline E and pertained to arrests in 2013 and 2020. In his SOR answer and in his hearing \ntestimony, Applicant admitted the allegations and provided additional information. The Judge \nfound against him on each of the allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s characterization of his arrests and the results \nof the ensuing legal proceedings. He also alleges that the Judge was biased against him. Our review \nof the decision confirms that the Judge considered all relevant issues and properly applied the \nmitigating conditions in a fair and neutral manner. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is 44 years old and has two children from a previous marriage and another from \na previous relationship. He served in the military from 1999 to 2020 and retired honorably in the \npaygrade E-7, having earned the Bronze Star, among other awards. He is currently employed by a \nfederal contractor. Applicant submitted, and the Judge considered, evidence of his military career \nas well as character letters which described Applicant as \u201can asset, an exemplary \nnoncommissioned officer, professional, stellar, conscientious, flexible, open-minded, efficient, \ndetailed-oriented, extremely competent, likable, knowledgeable, loyal, honest, compassionate, \ndisciplined, hardworking, trustworthy, and a person of integrity.\u201d Decision at 6. \nIn June 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault causing bodily injury/family \nmember; criminal mischief between $50 and $500; and interfering with an emergency call. He \nentered pleas of guilty to those charges and received a deferred disposition for 18 months, \ncontingent upon completion of 120 hours of community service and 18 months of probation. \nApplicant complied with these requirements, after which his pleas of guilty were amended to not \nguilty and the charges were dismissed. Tr. at 85-90; GE 4, 7, 8. Applicant addressed this matter in \nhis September 2021 security clearance application, disclosing that he \"was charged with \n[d]omestic violence to ex-girlfriend to whom we did not live together nor share children. The \ncharges were later dismissed.\" He identified the offense as a misdemeanor and that the \"[c]ase \nwent before judge and charges were dropped,\" but he did not disclose information about his guilty \npleas, deferred disposition, and probation. \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant provided an explanation of the incident, denied wrongdoing, \nand stated that \u201c[t]he charges against me were dismissed and I agreed to perform 100 hours of \ncommunity service, which I completed.\u201d When interviewed by a Government investigator in \nconjunction with his clearance investigation, Applicant addressed the incident by providing some \nadditional details while omitting others. Decision at 3; GE 3, 7. At his hearing, Applicant stated \n\u201cthe case was dismissed after completion of a class and 100 hours of community service,\u201d but that \nhe did not remember whether or not he had pleaded guilty to the offenses. Tr. at 84-85. \nln April 2020, Applicant was involved in an automobile accident in which he hit a stopped \ntruck. He left the scene of the accident and walked to a friend\u2019s house, after which he was taken to \na hospital and diagnosed with a concussion. Applicant also testified that while at the hospital he \ncontacted the police advising them that he had been involved in a vehicle accident. He was later \ncharged with felony failure to stop/accident and following too closely. He also was charged with \npossession of marijuana based upon items that were found at the scene of the accident. \nPursuant to a plea agreement, Applicant pled guilty to misdemeanor failure to stop/accident \nand the other charges were dismissed. He was sentenced to six months in jail, five and a half \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n---\nmonths of which were suspended \"for a period of five years conditions upon being of good \nbehavior, keeping the peace, obey this order, and paying fines and costs.\" He was also placed on \nprobation for five years. He remains on probation and under a suspended sentence until September \n2025. In his September 2021 security clearance application, Applicant described this event as \nhaving been charged with a misdemeanor in March 202l for failure to stop. He described his \nsentence as \"Judge sentenced me to 5 days in jail.\" (GE 1) Despite his guilty plea, at his DOHA \nhearing, Applicant denied wrongdoing because he \u201cunknowingly\u201d left the scene of the accident. \nTr. at 62. He testified that he was unaware how long the sentence suspension was for and that he \ndid not know he was on probation because it was unsupervised and his attorney did not tell him he \nwas on probation. Tr. 42-44, 51, 62 69, 81-83; GE 3, 5, 8. \nThe Judge found that Applicant was not credible, had minimized his culpability and the \ngravity of his criminal conduct, and had not taken full responsibility for his actions. Decision at 6, \n8-10. The Judge also noted that Applicant remains on probation and under a suspended jail \nsentence until September 2025. \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nBias \nApplicant argues that the Judge was biased against him, however we do not find his \nargument persuasive. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and \na party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. E.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). The issue is not whether Applicant personally \nbelieves that the Judge was biased or prejudiced against him but, rather, whether the record \n\u201ccontains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to \nquestion the fairness and impartiality of the Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. \n27, 2003). \nApplicant\u2019s initial assignment of error is that the Judge did \u201cnot appear to have much in \ncommon with [me] with respect to demographics,\u201d because Applicant is \u201ca person of color, a \nretired Army noncommissioned officer, a decorated combat veteran, a gun owner, and a single \nparent.\u201d However, Applicant\u2019s bare assertion is wholly inadequate to overcome the rebuttable \npresumptions of good faith, impartiality, and lack of bias. Absent evidence of discriminatory \nwords or conduct, the type of argument advanced by counsel in this case has no legitimate   place \nin these proceedings. It fails to raise any colorable claim of bias or the appearance of bias and goes \nbeyond the pale of permissible zealous advocacy. Claims of error should be based on arguments \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhaving a reasonable basis in the record evidence and procedural history of a case, not innuendo or \ninsinuation. See ISCR Case No. 03-14052 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2005); see also ISCR Case No. \n01-04713 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003). \nAdditionally, Applicant alleges that the Judge \u201cengaged in an excessive cross-\nexamination\u201d that \u201ccast aside her mantle of impartiality.\u201d This assertion is being raised for the first \ntime on appeal; Applicant\u2019s counsel at the hearing did not object to the Judge\u2019s questions or the \nmanner in which she conducted the hearing. Having had the opportunity to object at the hearing, \nApplicant cannot now object merely because the Judge rendered an unfavorable decision. ISCR \nCase No. 14-03569 at 3 (May 31, 2016). \nHowever, even if an objection had been timely raised, having examined the entirety of the \nrecord rather than excerpts cited out of context, we find that Applicant\u2019s concerns are insufficient \nto overcome the rebuttable presumption that the Judge acted in an impartial and unbiased manner. \nJudges in DOHA hearings are tasked with conducting the proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly \nmanner. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.10. While the Judge actively participated in the examination of Applicant \nduring both direct and cross examination, there is nothing in the record that can reasonably be seen \nas reflecting bias. The tone and focus of the Judge\u2019s questions were either administrative in nature \nor concentrated on clarifying Applicant\u2019s testimony. This is permissible under the Directive \nbecause as finder of fact, the Judge \u201cenjoys considerable latitude in conducting the proceedings, \nto include asking questions to clarify the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 11-08844 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, \n2013). \nThe transcript in this matter reflects that the Judge\u2019s questions were often pointed; \nhowever, they were targeted to the issues to be determined at hearing. Even where a Judge\u2019s \nmanner may be deemed \u201cinconsistent with the decorum normally anticipated in the courtroom,\u201d \u2013 \nwhich in this instance it was not \u2013 that alone is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge \ndecided the case on the record evidence. ISCR Case No. 03-24632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006) \n(no bias where the Judge\u2019s comments were \u201cgratuitous and at times harsh\u201d). See also ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03162 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2017) (no impartiality although the Judge \u201cquestioned \nApplicant sharply at times); ISCR Case No. 16-03451 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) (no bias \nalthough Judge \u201cconveyed a certain testiness\u201d); ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2022) (no impartiality where the Judge\u2019s \u201cquestioning and comments were occasionally sharp\u201d). \nWe find no bias or harmful error in the manner in which the Judge conducted the hearing. \nErrors in Findings of Fact and Failure to Apply Mitigating Conditions \nApplicant asserts that the Judge erred because she referred to him as being \u201cconvicted\u201d in \nthe assault case. He argues that although in other parts of the decision the Judge correctly states \nthat his pleas of guilty were amended to not guilty and the charges dismissed after meeting the \ndeferred sentencing terms, the erroneous use of the word \u201cconvicted\u201d constitutes harmful error. It \nis correct that Applicant was not convicted in the assault case. However, we do not evaluate a \nJudge's decision based on isolated words or sentences but, rather, on the decision viewed as a \nwhole. ISCR Case No. 20-00204 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2022). The security significance of this \nincident does not hinge on a conviction because even if criminal charges are reduced, dropped, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresulted in an acquittal, a Judge may still consider the underlying conduct in evaluating an \napplicant's security clearance eligibility. E.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00506 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, \n2018). Thus, the focus of a security clearance adjudication under Guidelines J and E includes \nassessing the underlying conduct and whether Applicant has been forthright and taken \nresponsibility for his actions. We agree that the Judge made a factual error, however it is clear \nfrom a reading of the entirety of the decision that the Judge understood that there was not a \nconviction in the assault case and focused only on relevant matters. The error is harmless as it does \nnot likely affect the outcome of the case. ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nApplicant also takes issue with the Judge\u2019s credibility determination and argues that the \nJudge erroneously \u201cmade this case about [Applicant\u2019s] integrity.\u201d This is an unusual and meritless \nargument inasmuch as an applicant\u2019s integrity is at the heart of a security clearance adjudication. \nAlthough the deference given a judge\u2019s credibility determination is not absolute, \u201ca party \nchallenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). In this case, the Judge had the opportunity to \npersonally observe Applicant's demeanor during his testimony and to weigh his testimony in light \nof the record evidence as a whole. The evolving nature of his explanations of the events \nsurrounding his arrests undermines the persuasiveness of his arguments and supports the Judge\u2019s \nconclusions. See ISCR Case No. 16-01645 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2018). Applicant has failed to \nestablish the Judge's conclusion as to his credibility was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. \nAn applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for \na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, there is a rebuttable \npresumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states \notherwise, and a bare assertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut \nthat presumption. E.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of \nthis case or in her decision. We have considered the entirety of Applicant\u2019s arguments. The record \nsupports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 \n(1962)). The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that \na clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d AG \u00b62(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nNovember 18, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a Decision on the written record. She was sent the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) to which she provided a response. On November 24, 2023, after \nconsidering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Charles C. \nHale concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 22 financial concerns including 20 consumer debts totaling \napproximately $200,000, a 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and a Federal tax delinquency of \napproximately $25,000 for tax years 2019 and 2021.

Applicant asserted that her delinquencies stemmed from a job-related \nmove from Virginia to Hawaii and restraints imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. She did not \nprovide, however, any evidence explaining how any of the specific debts were related to these \ncircumstances. The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to the tax delinquency (\u00b6 1.v) and five \ncredit card debts on which Applicant was an authorized user but not financially liable (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, \n1.h, 1.i, 1.q). He also found that three other debts and the bankruptcy had been mitigated. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.j. 1.m, 1.u). The remainder of the debts, totaling over $177,000, were found to be unmitigated.1 \nOn appeal, Counsel for Applicant first challenges several of the Judge\u2019s factual findings as \n\u201cwholly unsupported by the record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. As we have repeatedly explained, there \nis a difference between errors in a judge\u2019s findings of fact and errors in the conclusions drawn \ntherefrom. See ISCR Case No. 21-02121 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2023). Applicant\u2019s purported \nfactual errors are simply challenges to the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is addressed \nmore fully below. \nApplicant next contends that the Judge did not adequately consider the circumstances \nsurrounding the accrual of her delinquencies or her efforts to address her debts through a debt \nresolution firm. For example, she argues that the Judge erred in failing to apply mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 20(d), which affords mitigation when the individual initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, based on the finding that \nApplicant had not established a track record of debt payments. Appeal Brief at 16 (citing Decision \nat 9). She contends that she had established a track record of responsibly addressing her debts \ndespite the fact that they remained unpaid and were charged off. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). The scope of \nGuideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, but also extends to \nhis or her financial history. Applicant\u2019s arguments that \u201cthe Adjudicative Guidelines don\u2019t require \n[her] to demonstrate a \u2018track record,\u2019\u201d and that what constitutes a track record is \u201centirely vague\u201d \nare without merit. Appeal Brief at 16. In a Guideline F case, the Board has held that until an \napplicant has a \u201cmeaningful financial track record it cannot be said as a matter of law that he has \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). The concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily \nincludes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d Id. Payment agreements \nalone amount to promises to pay in the future, which are \u201cnot a substitute for a track record of \npaying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). Although Applicant engaged the services of a \n1 The Administrative Judge found that mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applied to the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \nand 1.l, but that the debts were ultimately not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(d) because resolution of the debts \u201coccurred \nonly because of legal action against [Applicant] by the creditor.\u201d Decision at 9. These debts are not addressed in the \nFormal Findings; however, based upon the narrative discussion, it is clear that these allegations were found against \nApplicant and that the omission in the Formal Findings is a harmless typographical error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n05-02802 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2007). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebt firm that itself went into bankruptcy and subsequently retained legal counsel to help address \nher debts, by close of the record in this matter, she had voluntarily resolved only two accounts \ntotaling approximately $2,500 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j) and was making voluntary payments on only two \nothers (\u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.v). \nThe Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances and efforts in his decision and reasonably \nconcluded she had not established a track record of repayment. In essence, Applicant is advocating \nfor an alternative weighing of the evidence. An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient \nto demonstrate the judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2007). \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence. The mere presence of some favorable or mitigating evidence does not require the \nJudge to make an overall favorable determination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as \nApplicant\u2019s. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). The Judge\u2019s conclusion \nthat Applicant had not demonstrated a track record of debt resolution sufficient to mitigate the \nconcerns arising from his financial problems is sustainable. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the personal conduct (Guideline E) and \nmisuse of information technology allegation (Guideline M) with explanations and denied the \nremaining allegations. The Judge found against Applicant on all of the SOR allegations. Consistent \nwith the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-60s, employed by a defense contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s and a \nmaster\u2019s degree. He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1980 to 1991, and in the Navy \nReserve from 1991 until retiring in 2010 as a Captain (pay grade O-6). The conduct that gave rise \nto the SOR occurred during Applicant\u2019s employment with a defense contractor and resulted in his \ninvoluntary termination in May 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s employer found that he used his company computer to view pornographic \nimages in his workspace on a recurring basis between March and April 2021, in violation of \ncompany policy. Applicant mischarged approximately 15.5 hours of time to a direct program that \nwas not actually worked because of recurrent access to pornographic websites during working \nhours, in violation of company timesheet accounting policies. Applicant\u2019s excuse for this \nmisconduct is that he intended to flag the lack of IT support and the improper blocking of military \nwebsites he needed for his work. Applicant\u2019s claim that he completed his work assignments while \nthe open pornographic sites were \u201cminimized\u201d was found not credible. Applicant continued to \nengage in this inappropriate behavior until he was caught. The Judge found that this recurring and \nrepeated searching and accessing of pornographic sites, in and of itself, raise serious concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s judgment, and showed his failure to take accountability for his actions. \nIn his whole-person assessment, the Judge acknowledged Applicant\u2019s successes, \naccomplishments, and positive character evidence, but stated: \nWhen evaluating this case, two things come to mind. Either Applicant is \ntelling the truth and exercised a severe lack of judgment over an extended period of \ntime by accessing pornographic sites during a two-month period to get the attention \nof and demonstrate to his company\u2019s IT department that his company had a problem \nwith their firewalls. Alternatively, Applicant is lying about intentionally accessing \npornographic sites during work hours on his company-issued computer and caused \nhis company to bill clients for the time when he was accessing these sites. In either \ncase, he did so in clear violation of company policy. Applicant failed to provide \nproof that he notified his supervisor or IT personnel that he was experiencing these \nfirewall problems that he claims inhibited his ability to complete his job \nassignments. The record evidence and objective assessment of his credibility \nestablish that [Applicant] lied when he provided a false narrative about his reasons \nfor going to pornographic sites during the duty day. His false statements and \nattempted justifications at his hearing show a lack a rehabilitation and weigh against \ncontinuing his national security eligibility for access to classified information. \n[Decision at 14-15.] \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. E.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s decision so much as he challenges the \nfact that the SOR was issued without consideration of his education, background, performance, \nand responsibilities. He further contests that the SOR was issued without considering the \nunderlying facts surrounding his admitted sexual conduct and argues that the allegations resulting \nfrom his conduct were not based in fact. These contentions misconstrue the nature of an SOR. The \nissuance of an SOR simply is a step along the continuum of a security clearance adjudication and \nin and of itself, does not constitute or effectuate an adverse adjudicative determination. The \nadministrative process set forth in the Directive provides applicant with the opportunity to address \nthose allegations, which he did. See Directive, Enclosure 3. The fact that allegations in an SOR \nultimately are found for or against an applicant does not impugn the issuance of the SOR. \nAlternatively, Applicant\u2019s somewhat circuitous arguments may be interpreted as alleging \nthat the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by record evidence and that the Judge similarly \noverlooked his education and background. However, Applicant has not pointed to any findings of \nfact that were unsupported by the evidence or any failure of the Judge to consider particular \nevidence in mitigation. Rather, Applicant appears to be rearguing his case in mitigation, including \nhis version of the facts in the same manner as was addressed at the hearing. \nWe have long held that a disagreement with or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Concerning the factual assertions made on \nappeal that are already part of the record, the Directive does not empower the Board to weigh the \nrecord evidence de novo and make its own findings and conclusions about the case. Rather, the \nBoard addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether the Judge has made \nfactual or legal error. Likewise, with regard to Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the issuance of the \nSOR, the Appeal Board has no jurisdiction or authority to supervise security clearance \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvestigations or pass judgment on the necessity or sufficiency of such investigations. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 01-19823 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 3, 2003). \nTo the extent that Applicant disagrees with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, none of \nhis arguments are sufficient to establish the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. Here, despite Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant lied and falsely attempted to justify his \nactions are sufficiently supported by the record. In our analysis of the Judge\u2019s decision, we find \nthat the Judge considered all aspects of the case and reasonably concluded that the disqualifying \nconcerns were of such significance that they were not mitigated by Applicant\u2019s explanations. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 25, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations, Guideline G \n(Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline (J (Criminal Conduct) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective \nJune 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On May 16, 2024, \nafter conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Charles \nC. Hale denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had criminal and alcohol related offenses, and financial \nconcerns including two Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings, a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy discharge, tax debts \nowed to Federal and state tax authorities, and a charged-off credit card debt. Additionally, the SOR \nalleged that Applicant was sued by various homeowners and condominium associations for non\u00ad\npayment of dues in at least 11 separate civil actions and that he was the subject of four foreclosure \nproceedings. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. The Judge found in \nhis favor for the Guideline G and J allegations and against him on all of the Guideline F allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not allege the Judge committed harmful error, but argues \nfor reconsideration of certain efforts he has made to resolve debts, includes additional argument \nas to the current status of some debts, and submits new and previously considered evidence. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-40s and has been employed by a defense contractor since 2022. He \nis married and has two children. Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies, including a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2010, and Chapter 13 filings in 2020 and 2021; both dismissed. \nHis bankruptcies were primarily filed because of a failed property management business venture \nthat resulted in judgments and foreclosures of rental property resulting in a discharge of about $1.6 \nmillion in debt. Applicant was also sued by various homeowners and condominium associations \nfor nonpayment of dues in at least 11 civil actions since 2009. He was the subject of four \nforeclosure actions; two in 2009 and two in 2013 and 2017, including for his current home for \nwhich he is behind about a year in mortgage payments. He is also delinquent in Federal and state \nincome taxes. The Judge found that Applicant has a history of irresponsible financial behavior that \nwas not sufficiently mitigated. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant argues for reconsideration of certain efforts he has made to \nresolve debts, includes additional argument as to the current status of some debts, and provides \nadditional evidence for consideration. \nWe have often stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ncollecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, \n2008). The scope of Guideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, \nbut also extends to his or her financial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). However, an applicant must act responsibly \ngiven his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct even if it may only provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). With regard to additional or clarifying evidence \npresented on appeal, the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal and \ndoes not review cases de novo. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

His conduct is criminal and is high-risk sexual behavior that reflects a lack \nof discretion or judgment. It also creates a vulnerability to coercion, as discussed \nbelow under Guideline E. The evidence is sufficient to raise [two] disqualifying \nconditions.1 \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 [14 to include \u00b6\u00b6 14(b)-14(e)].2 \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant is 56 years old, and the sexual behavior occurred more than two [sic] \nyears ago. It also only lasted for two months. His wife is aware of his conduct. He \nhas taken steps to correct this problem, participating in sexaholics anonymous, \nobtaining a sponsor, and attending marital therapy. Sexual Behavior is found for \nApplicant. [Id. at 4-5.] \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) Engaging in activities which, if now, could affect the personal\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n1 AG \u00b6 13: (a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted; and (c) sexual \nbehavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n2 AG \u00b6 14: (b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; (c) the \nbehavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress; (d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, \nconsensual, and discreet; and (e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of treatment, or is \ncurrently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indication the behavior is readily \ncontrollable with treatment. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant knowingly viewed child pornography.

We focus on the most dispositive below. \nFailure to Examine Relevant Evidence and to Consider Important Aspects of the Case \nThe Government argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to consider important aspects of the case\u2014 \nto include the severity and extent of Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal behavior, Applicant\u2019s failure \nto take responsibility for the extent of his behavior, the evidence indicating Applicant\u2019s ongoing \nvulnerability to coercion, and Applicant\u2019s overall lack of credibility.\u201d Appeal Brief at 13-14. We \nagree. We turn first to relevant evidence that the Judge failed to examine regarding the gravity of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and Applicant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility.4 \nLetter of Revocation: In November 2019, AGA issued a letter of revocation (LOR), \nnotifying Applicant that it had revoked his security clearance the prior month. GE 3 at 31. The \nLOR summarized Applicant\u2019s discussions with a polygraph examiner in July and August 2019, in \nwhich Applicant disclosed visiting websites during the summer of 2018 that contained pictures \nand videos of nude minor children engaging in sexual acts. In his discussion with the polygrapher, \nApplicant admitted the following: that he visited \u201csites containing sexual videos and photographs \nof children as young as babies to children as old as 17 between the summer of 2018 and September \n2018;\u201d that \u201call the children on the sites he viewed were nude and engaging in sexual activity;\u201d \nthat he visited the sites multiple times per week and approximated his viewing time as \u201croughly \nfive hours per week;\u201d that he kept going to the sites because of the \u201celement of surprise;\u201d that he \nwas \u201cnever bored and [was] interested in discovering what was new and different on these sites;\u201d \nthat law enforcement came to his home in September 2018 to execute a search warrant based on \nhis online activity; and that he advised the officers that he was the household member who \n\u201coccasionally\u201d visited the websites containing underage pornography. Id. at 31-32. \nThe LOR also stated that Applicant had a telephonic interview with a security \nrepresentative on August 28, 2019, in which he \u201cconfirmed the details provided during [his] \npolygraph examination.\u201d Id. at 32. In his findings of fact and analysis, the Judge failed to reference \nor examine the LOR \u2013 the gravamen of the Government\u2019s case. \nSubsequent Statements: The Government highlights that, since the LOR was issued in \nNovember 2019, Applicant has \u201crepeatedly minimized his offenses and tried to explain away his \nviewing of child pornography as unintentional.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. Indeed, the record reflects an \n4 The Government also raises arguments about Applicant\u2019s failure to report the interaction with law enforcement to \nAGA and the Judge\u2019s failure to address that issue more fully. We elect not to address those portions of the brief. First, \nit is unnecessary, given the gravity of the other errors identified. Second, and more important, the SOR under Guideline \nE alleged AGA\u2019s revocation of Applicant\u2019s clearance, not the underlying conduct of viewing child pornography and \nfailing to report his interactions with law enforcement. Although the Judge to some extent treated the underlying \nconduct as alleged under Guideline E, we decline to do the same. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nevolving effort by Applicant over the past three years to distance himself from his polygraph-\nprompted admissions. \nSecurity Interview: In his November 2021 DoD clearance interview, Applicant asserted \nthat he \u201ccontinued to view this kind of material more out of curiosity as he never knew that it \nexisted,\u201d that he was \u201ctrying to understand the genre,\u201d and that he had only viewed child \npornography \u201caround a dozen times.\u201d GE 3 at 7. \nResponse to Revocation: In December 2021, Applicant submitted via counsel a written \nresponse to AGA\u2019s revocation of his clearance. In his letter, Applicant requested four changes to \nthe language of the LOR, as it \u201cmischaracterize[d] the responses that he provided during his \npolygraph examination.\u201d Id. at 17. He requested to strike the phrase \u201cas young as babies to children \nas old as 17,\u201d as he claimed that \u201cthe mention of sexual activity with babies is misleading and \ninflammatory.\u201d Id. Although Applicant asserted that the \u201ccontent of underage individuals was not \nall sexual acts,\u201d he admitted that there was \u201csome sexual content across the range of ages you \nmentioned.\u201d Id. Applicant also requested that the language \u201call of the children on the sites you \nviewed were nude and were engaged in sexual activity\u201d be changed to \u201cthe children on the sites \nyou viewed were nude and sometimes were engaged in sexual activity.\u201d Id. Additionally, \nApplicant sought to establish that his estimated viewing time of five hours per week included all \npornography rather than solely child pornography and to strike the phrase \u201cnever bored.\u201d Id. at 18. \nHe requested no other corrections or edits. \nResponse to AGA Questions: In April 2022, Applicant responded in writing to follow-up \nquestions from AGA\u2019s appeal process and asserted, for the first time in the record, that he visited \nthe websites that contained child pornography because he was \u201clooking for naked images of \nmodels less than 18 years old.\u201d Id. at 65 (emphasis added). \nResponse to DOHA Interrogatories: In March 2023, Applicant responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories and included a personal statement in which he again asserted that he was looking \nfor \u201cyoung models, even just clothed for the reasons of nostalgia.\u201d GE 4 at 2. He further stated that \nhe \u201cwas upset and humiliated to be accused of such a heinous thing [child pornography] \u2013 it had \nno factual basis.\u201d Id. \nResponse to SOR: In his April 2023 Response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations \nunder Guidelines D and E, asserting that any suggestion that he took steps to view child \npornography intentionally was \u201cabsolutely incorrect.\u201d SOR Response at 3, 7. \nHearing Testimony: In his September 2023 hearing, Applicant again claimed that his \nviewing of child pornography was \u201cnot intentional\u201d but instead \u201cjust part of browsing.\u201d Tr. at 22. \nThe Judge\u2019s brief recitation of facts and briefer analysis ignored all details of the polygraph, \nthe detailed admissions that resulted, and Applicant\u2019s ongoing efforts to dilute those admissions \nand minimize his conduct. At best, the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are incomplete. In sum, our review \nof the record convinces us that the Judge failed to examine and consider relevant evidence. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nDespite Applicant\u2019s repeated denials that he intentionally viewed child pornography, the \nJudge concluded that \u201cApplicant intentionally viewed child pornography over a period of two \nmonths in 2018.\u201d Decision at 4. The Government argues that \u2013 given Applicant\u2019s denials \u2013 the \nJudge\u2019s finding that Applicant intentionally viewed child pornography is fundamentally \ninconsistent with his conclusion that Applicant mitigated his behavior. This argument has merit \nfor at least two reasons. First, we have long held that rehabilitation and reform is difficult to \nestablish if an applicant refuses to accept responsibility for his actions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n96-0360 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05351 at 8 (App. Bd. Mar. 12, \n2010) (reversing a grant in part because the judge failed to consider the applicant\u2019s refusal to accept \nresponsibility for accessing child pornography). Here, the Judge fails to identify the particular \nmitigating conditions he relied upon, but he appears to rely in part on the passage of time: \n\u201cApplicant is 56 years old, and the sexual behavior occurred more than two [sic] years ago.\u201d \nDecision at 5. As we have previously stated, \u201c[w]hatever mitigating value attaches to the passage \nof time since the conduct, it is seriously diminished by Applicant\u2019s failure to acknowledge the \nmisconduct.\u201d ISCR Case No. 08-05351 at 8. See also ISCR Case No. 17-01680 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. \n19, 2019) (\u201cApplicant\u2019s reliance on the age of the misconduct is undercut by the fact that currently \nApplicant denies that he has viewed or possessed child pornography.\u201d). \nSecond, and more significantly, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant intentionally viewed \nchild pornography over the course of two months carries with it an implicit finding that Applicant \nwas untruthful at least three times during the security clearance process \u2013 in responding to DOHA \ninterrogatories, in answering his SOR, and in testifying at the hearing. Applicant\u2019s contradictory \nversions of his child pornography viewing habits and his evolving denials raise obvious questions \nabout his honesty throughout the security clearance process that the Judge needed to acknowledge \nand weigh in assessing Applicant\u2019s candor, integrity, and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20\u00ad\n01450 at 8 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2022). The Judge erred in failing to acknowledge or address this \ncritically important aspect of the case \u2013 Applicant\u2019s credibility \u2013 and entirely failed to articulate a \nrational basis for his conclusion that Applicant had nevertheless mitigated the security concerns. \nThe Government also challenges the Judge\u2019s apparent reliance on mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6 14(c) and AG \u00b6 17(e).5 In both his Guideline D and E analyses, the Judge cites to the fact \nthat Applicant\u2019s wife is aware of his conduct. Decision at 5, 6. At hearing, Applicant admitted that \nhe told no one about the child pornography other than his wife and children, who were present at \nthe time of the search, the members of his Sexaholics Anonymous group, and an evaluating \npsychologist. Tr. at 35. He did not tell his coworkers or the supervisor who testified for him at \nhearing. An Assistant Scoutmaster at the time of the law enforcement search, Applicant did not \ntell anyone in that organization but instead simply resigned. Id. at 35-36. In focusing solely on his \nwife\u2019s awareness of Applicant\u2019s conduct, the Government argues, \u201cthe Judge erred by failing to \nanalyze the high potential risk of Applicant being exploited by one threatening to disclose his child \npornography consumption to his company, coworkers, and members or parents of his Boy Scout \ntroop.\u201d Appeal Brief at 18. We agree and find error in the Judge\u2019s failure to consider all relevant \nevidence on the issue of vulnerability to coercion. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s conclusion in his Whole\u00ad\n5 AG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress; AG \u00b6 17(e): the individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPerson analysis that \u201cApplicant is well respected in his community and in his workplace\u201d is plainly \nundermined by that fact that Applicant\u2019s community and workplace do not know about the child \npornography and the resulting law enforcement interest. \nConclusion \nAfter considering the Government\u2019s arguments in light of the entirety of the record, we \nconclude that the Judge failed to examine relevant evidence and to consider important aspects of \nthe case. Consequently, his findings are incomplete, conclusory, and not based upon consideration \nof all relevant and material evidence. Directive \u00b6 6.3. The Judge failed to articulate an explanation \nfor his conclusions and rendered a decision that runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. \nIn sum, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant mitigated the Guideline D and Guideline E security \nconcerns is arbitrary and capricious.

On \nDecember 1, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On April 16, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nPaul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged four delinquent student loans totaling approximately \n$98,300. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations, and the Judge found against \nApplicant on all allegations.

After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013, Applicant \nworked as a receptionist and benefits coordinator and subsequently as an administrative research \nassistant, and she is currently employed as a recruiting coordinator of engineers. \nThe four SOR allegations are for state-issued student loans obtained between 2008 and \n2011 for which Applicant\u2019s parents co-signed. Initially, Applicant\u2019s mother, who was employed \nas a nursery school director, was paying on the student loans. After her death in 2011, Applicant\u2019s \nfather, who is retired from state employment, fell behind on paying the loans, and they defaulted \nat some time. Applicant did not know what the monthly payments were at the time of her mother\u2019s \ndeath and could not recall when the student loans defaulted as she was living in another state and \nthe correspondence was being sent to her parents. \nApplicant stated that she called the state lender a few years after her mother\u2019s death but \nwas presented with payment and consolidation options that she could not meet. In 2020, Applicant \nagain contacted the state lender, and they offered three different repayment options for each of the \nfour loans. The proposed settlement agreement would call for a total monthly payment of $1,200 \nfor the four loans, which Applicant could not afford. \nDuring the December 2023 hearing, Applicant testified that she has been making monthly \npayments on eight student loans held by a second student loan lender since 2013. Applicant also \nprovided documentation from a third student loan lender indicating that her father is paying $283 \na month on a student loan that is only his responsibility, with an outstanding principal balance of \n$5,585. As the Judge noted: \u201cThe credit bureau reports show that Applicant pays all her bills in a \ntimely manner except for the listed student loans. She paid off her car loan and is responsible with \nher finances. Applicant is current on the eight student loans to the second student lender.\u201d Decision \nat 3 (internal cites omitted). \nOn January 4, 2024, Applicant entered into a settlement agreement with the state lender \nof the four alleged SOR loans. Under the agreement, the lender agreed to accept $120,000 without \nadditional interest, conditioned upon repayment of $500 /month for 240 months beginning on \nJanuary 15, 2024. After nine consecutive payments have been made, the loans will be considered \nrehabilitated, thereby removing the defaulted status of the loans from the Applicant\u2019s credit report. \nApplicant made the first $500 payment on January 3, 2024.In addition to her mother paying on \nthe four listed student loans, Applicant claimed that her father and brother paid on the loans over \nthe years. Regarding her father\u2019s payment contribution, Applicant was certain that he made \npayments, but she did not know how much. On the subject of Applicant\u2019s purported payments to \nthe listed student loan debts before the issuance of the SOR in December 2022, she claimed that \nshe and her father have been paying as much as they could each month. She claimed that she made \noccasional payments to the listed creditors during the pandemic (2020 to 2022). The record shows \nthat Applicant\u2019s payments on the listed student loan accounts did not begin until 2023. In that year, \nshe made 11 or 12 monthly payments totaling $600 to the collection firm representing the listed \nstate lender. Hence, her claims regarding earlier payments are unsupported and therefore not \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredible. She has presented no documentation, i.e., bank statements, receipts, or payment ledgers, \nor documentation from her father or brother to support her claims. The credit bureau reports show \nno payment activity on the listed accounts from 2018 to January 2023. [Id. at 4 (internal cites \nomitted.)] \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below. \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports confirm that the debts listed in the SOR became \ndelinquent in June 2018 and total approximately $98,300, establishing both AG \u00b6 19(a), an \ninability to satisfy debts, and AG \u00b6 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations. AG \u00b6 \n19(b), an unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so, does not apply based on \nApplicant\u2019s track record of payments on her eight other student loans. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) is not available for mitigation. The student loan accounts were \nopened between 2008 and 2011. Applicant claimed that she, her father, and her \nbrother paid on the student loans over the years and occasionally during the \npandemic between 2020 and 2022. Though the record shows payment activity until \n2018, the record shows no evidence of payments on the listed debts at any time by \nApplicant until 2023, when she began paying $50 a month on the delinquent loans. \nThe payments did not begin until after she received the SOR in December 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of evidence addressing the student loans before 2023 continues to \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay on the listed delinquent loans cannot be based \non employment issues, as she has been continuously employed since 2016. There \nis no record of any kind of unexpected event that contributed to her delinquent \nloans. In addition, there is no evidence that she acted responsibly before she \nreceived the SOR in December 2022 to address the delinquent loans. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply as Applicant has not had financial counseling. \nThough there is some evidence that she lives frugally, she did not furnish evidence \nof financial strategies, i.e., a written budget, or other accounting system, that could \ncontinuously enable her to monitor her financial obligations. \nWhile Applicant warrants some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) based on the \nJanuary 2024 settlement agreement, the mitigation due is insufficient to overcome \nthe lack of evidence of loan payments by Applicant before 2023. In addition, based \non the figures that she provided regarding her income and expenses, it will be \ndifficult for her to absorb an additional $500 a month expense for the next 240 \nmonths without running a monthly deficit. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, \nto establish her case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt reduction. While an applicant is not \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequired to show that every debt listed in the SOR is paid, the applicant must show \nthat she has a plan for debt resolution and has taken significant action to implement \nthe plan. Applicant\u2019s year-long record of payments in 2023 and January 2024 \nsettlement is insufficient to overcome the absence of student loan payments by her \nat any time before 2023, specifically after 2018. AG \u00b6 20(d) is unavailable for \nmitigation because of the absence of a meaningful track record of repayments. [Id. \nat 6 (internal cites omitted).] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant highlights that\u2014contrary to the Judge\u2019s findings\u2014the record \nestablishes payments on the alleged loans prior to issuance of the SOR. We agree and, for the \nreasons stated below, reverse the Judge\u2019s adverse decision. \nWhen an Administrative Judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine \nwhether \u201c[t]he Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as \na reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive, E3.1.32.1. The Board must consider not only whether \nthere is record evidence supporting a Judge\u2019s findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly \ndetracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge\u2019s \nfindings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n12199 at 2\u20133 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). \nA judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if it \u201cfails to examine relevant \nevidence, fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, \nfails to be based on a consideration of relevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere \ndifference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 94-0215 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor \nVehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nAs is clear from the Judge\u2019s findings and analysis summarized above, the Judge found \nadversely to Applicant because he was convinced that she failed to make any payments on the four \nalleged student loans prior to issuance of the SOR. Finding no evidence of pre-SOR payments in \nher documents, the Judge also concluded that Applicant was not credible in testifying regarding \nher efforts to repay the alleged debts. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s findings, however, Applicant\u2019s \nevidence supports her testimony that she made payments prior to the SOR, including intermittent \npayments during the COVID era. Her documents confirm 19 payments to the state lender\u2019s \ncollection agency beginning in January 2020 (prior to completing the SCA) through December \n2022 (when the SOR was issued). Most of the payment amounts were modest, but Applicant never \nrepresented otherwise. The Judge\u2019s finding that \u201cApplicant\u2019s payments on the listed student loan \naccounts did not begin until 2023\u201d is erroneous, as are his findings that \u201cher claims regarding \nearlier payments are unsupported and therefore not credible\u201d and that she \u201cpresented no \ndocumentation . . . to support her claims.\u201d Decision at 4. In summary, the Judge\u2019s findings on this \ncritical issue do not reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. ISCR \nCase No. 02-12199 at 2\u20133. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThese factual errors are inarguably harmful, as the Judge relied heavily upon them in his \nmitigation analysis. Specifically, the Judge concluded that AG \u00b6 20(a) did not apply because \u201cthe \nrecord shows no evidence of payments on the listed debts at any time by Applicant until 2023 . . . \nafter she received the SOR in December 2022\u201d; that mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) did not apply \nbecause there is \u201cno evidence that she acted responsibly before she received the SOR in December \n2022\u201d and that \u201cwhile Applicant warrants some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) based on the January \n2024 settlement agreement, the mitigation due is insufficient to overcome the lack of evidence of \nloan payments by Applicant before 2023.\u201d Decision at 6. \nIn addition to the significant factual errors highlighted above, we conclude that the Judge \nfailed to consider relevant evidence of record. In citing repeatedly to Applicant\u2019s failure to make \nany payments to the state lender between 2018 and 2023, the Judge overlooked a critical fact\u2014 \nApplicant took five loans from the state lender, not four, and she paid off the smallest one in \nDecember 2019.1 Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 14; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 10; GE 5 at 11. This fact, \nwhich the Judge never referenced, further establishes that Applicant was making payments after \n2018 to the state lender, in direct contradiction of the Judge\u2019s findings. But equally important, the \nfact that the Judge ignored a satisfied debt to the same state lender underscores a larger problem \nwith the decision\u2013that the Judge focused unduly on the four alleged debts without considering \nsignificant evidence in mitigation, to include Applicant\u2019s overall financial history and condition. \nIn doing so, the Judge failed to consider an important aspect of the case. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). The scope of \nGuideline F encompasses not only an applicant\u2019s current financial situation, but also extends to \nher financial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to develop \na plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). An applicant must, however, act responsibly given her \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct \neven if it may only provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008). What constitutes responsible behavior depends on the facts of a given \ncase and the fact that an applicant's debts will not be paid off for a long time, in and of itself, may \nbe of limited security concern. Relevant to the equation is an assessment as to whether an applicant \nacted responsibly given her limited resources. ISCR Case No. 22-00180 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, \n2024). \nApplicant is a young person who accrued significant federal and state student loan debt to \nearn her bachelor\u2019s degree and obtained relatively low-paying jobs after graduation. \nNotwithstanding, she has made regular monthly payments on her federal student loans, and all \neight are in good standing. She tried on two occasions to negotiate a payment agreement with the \nstate loan holder but was unable to meet their proposed terms. Nevertheless, she paid off one of \nfive loans, made intermittent payments on the other four since January 2020, and made consistent \n1 The credit bureau reports indicate that a balance of $1 remained on the debt after a final payment in December 2019, \nbut for the purposes of this discussion the Board is considering that debt as resolved. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments since January 2023.

Moreover, Applicant lives a frugal life, \npaying off a modest car loan entirely, and carrying no debt other than her federal and state loans. \nNothing in this record hints at irresponsible or frivolous spending. Indeed, the Judge found that \n\u201c[t]he credit bureau reports show that Applicant pays all her bills in a timely manner except for \nthe listed student loans. . . and is responsible with her finances.\u201d Decision at 3 (emphasis added). \nIn reaching his adverse decision, the Judge failed to consider the four alleged debts in the broader \ncontext of Applicant\u2019s financial history and, in doing so, failed to consider an important aspect of \nthe case. \nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision contains \nsignificant factual errors, fails to consider important aspects of the case, and runs contrary to the \nrecord evidence. \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, in his mid-30s, was married from November 2017 until his divorce in January 2019, and he has two children. He has held a security clearance since 2007. From 2010 until 2014, Applicant earned $70,000 per year. He was laid off in October 2014 and remained unemployed for about six months. In March 2015, he took a position paying $75,000 per year. In February 2016, he took a new job that paid $100,000 per year, but he left after a year because of poor performance and was unemployed from February 2017 until September 2017. Applicant started a new job with his current security clearance sponsor in September 2017 and his annual salary is currently $170,000. Per his April 2023 financial statement, his monthly net remainder after paying all other expenses was just over $6,400. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his periods of unemployment from October 2014 to March 2015 and February 2017 to September 2017 and needing the money to help with family. He acknowledged not having sufficient funds withheld for tax purposes and testified that he used the money owed to the federal and state taxing authorities to meet other obligations, such as \u201clife expenses,\u201d childcare, credit cards, and phone bills.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nJulie R. Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nCarl Anthony Marrone, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 23, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On September 5, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nCharles C. Hale granted Applicant security clearance eligibility. The Government appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged various tax concerns, including that Applicant failed to timely pay his \nfederal and state income taxes for at least tax years 2011 and 2015 through 2020 and that he carried \napproximately $73,000 in delinquent federal and state tax balances. During the March 2024 \nhearing, the SOR was amended to further allege that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and \nstate tax returns for tax years 2021 and 2022. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant, in his mid-30s, was married from November 2017 until his divorce in January \n2019, and he has two children. He has held a security clearance since 2007. \nFrom 2010 until 2014, Applicant earned $70,000 per year. He was laid off in October 2014 \nand remained unemployed for about six months. In March 2015, he took a position paying $75,000 \nper year. In February 2016, he took a new job that paid $100,000 per year, but he left after a year \nbecause of poor performance and was unemployed from February 2017 until September 2017. \nApplicant started a new job with his current security clearance sponsor in September 2017 and his \nannual salary is currently $170,000. Per his April 2023 financial statement, his monthly net \nremainder after paying all other expenses was just over $6,400. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his periods of unemployment from October \n2014 to March 2015 and February 2017 to September 2017 and needing the money to help with \nfamily. He acknowledged not having sufficient funds withheld for tax purposes and testified that \nhe used the money owed to the federal and state taxing authorities to meet other obligations, such \nas \u201clife expenses,\u201d childcare, credit cards, and phone bills. Decision at 3. \nApplicant asserted that he entered into payment plans with both the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) and state taxing authorities. He explained that he resolved the 2011 and 2018 federal \ntax delinquencies and is required to make $700 monthly payments for the remaining 2019 and \n2020 balances. He is required to make monthly payments of about $550 for his state tax balance, \nwhich was about $12,000 as of January 2024. Applicant asserted that his state plan was established \nin 2020 but failed to provide documentation supporting that start date. His installment agreements \nreflect that he makes his payments on time and makes occasional lump sum payments in addition \nto his regular payments. \nFinally, Applicant denied that he failed to timely file his 2021 and 2022 federal and state \ntax returns. He filed an extension for tax year 2021 and testified that the IRS and state had received \nbut not yet processed all of the returns. He further testified that he owes about $21,000 for the two \nadditional tax years, which are not part of his payment plans with the IRS or state. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOn appeal, the Government challenges one of the Judge\u2019s factual findings and argues that \nhis applications of the mitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept were arbitrary, capricious, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand not supported by the record evidence. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or capricious if: \u201cit \ndoes not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its \nconclusions, including a rational connection between the facts and the choice made; [it] does not \nconsider relevant factors; [it] reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important \naspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; \nor [it] is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). For the reasons stated below, we reverse \nthe Judge\u2019s decision. \n2021 and 2022 Tax Returns \nIn the second of his two-sentence favorable mitigation analysis, the Judge found that there \nwas \u201csufficient evidence that [Applicant] filed his 2021 and 2022 returns on time.\u201d Decision at 7. \nThe Government challenges this finding as \u201cunsupported and otherwise contradicted by the \nrecord,\u201d and contends that this amounts to harmful error due to the Judge\u2019s heavy reliance on the \nerroneous finding in his mitigation analysis and, in particular, his application of AG \u00b6 20(g).1 \nAppeal Brief at 11. This argument has merit. \nThe \u201csufficient evidence\u201d relied upon by the Judge in making the challenged finding \nappears to rest entirely in Applicant\u2019s 2022 prepared federal return, electronically signed by his \ntax preparer on October 15, 2023, coupled with Applicant\u2019s explanation that \u201cthe IRS and state \nhad received his tax returns but had not processed them,\u201d which he knew because \u201chis tax preparer \nhad received an acknowledgement that his 2021 and 2022 state returns had been accepted.\u201d \nDecision at 3. \nApplicant produced no documentation regarding the status of his 2021 or 2022 state tax \nreturns and declined to produce the acknowledgment purportedly received by his tax preparer. He \ndid, however, produce his 2021 and 2022 federal tax account transcripts, which reflect that as of \nMarch 14, 2024 \u2013 just six days before the hearing \u2013 neither tax return was filed. Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) Z at 6, 9.2 \nWhile Administrative Judges have responsibility for, and broad discretion in weighing \nevidence, that discretion is not unlimited. See ISCR Case No. 99-0511 at 13-14 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2000) (citations omitted). When conflicts exist within the record, a judge must weigh the evidence \nand resolve those conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the evidence\u2019s \n\u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). No such evaluation occurred in this case. Although the Judge \nacknowledged that Applicant provided IRS transcripts, he failed entirely to reference, let alone \nanalyze, the unfavorable information contained therein. \n1 AG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed \nand is in compliance with those arrangements. \n2 It is also worth noting that, while Applicant was granted an extension until October 2023 to file his 2022 federal \nreturn (see AE U at 25; AE Z at 9), he received no extension to file his 2021 federal return. The Judge found that \nApplicant \u201cfiled for an extension for tax year 2021,\u201d which is also in error, albeit likely a typographical and therefore \nharmless one. Decision at 3. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nHere, Applicant\u2019s federal tax account transcripts are the record\u2019s most recent and formal \ndocumentary evidence concerning his 2021 and 2022 returns, and they unambiguously reflect that \nthe returns are unfiled. Applicant had the opportunity to provide evidence to support his testimony \nthat his returns were filed and accepted but not yet processed, but he declined to do so. Although \nthe Judge had to consider Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony, he could not uncritically accept it in the \nface of other significant, relevant, and material conflicting evidence. See ISCR Case No. 01-07292 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 29, 2004) (citation omitted). It was therefore arbitrary and capricious for the \nJudge to find that Applicant\u2019s 2021 and 2022 tax returns have been filed. Moreover, because these \nerrors formed the basis for the Judge\u2019s mitigation of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l, the resulting favorable \nformal findings are unsustainable. \nMitigation and Whole-Person Analyses \nWith respect to the remaining SOR allegations, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s history of \ntax problems established disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f).3 He went on to \nfind that the concerns were mitigated because \u201cApplicant provided supporting documentation to \ndemonstrate his good-faith efforts to remedy his significant amount of outstanding taxes, and he \nis systematically paying his Federal and state tax debts.\u201d Decision at 6-7. The Government argues \nthat the Judge\u2019s mitigating analysis is \u201caltogether unsupported by a reasonable reading of the \nrecord as a whole.\u201d Appeal Brief at 13. \nThe Government first challenges the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 20(b), which affords \nmitigation when the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control and the individual acted responsibly under those circumstances. The Judge did \nnot specifically identify which circumstances he found met the foregoing criteria, but it appears he \nrelied on Applicant\u2019s five months of unemployment from October 2014 to March 2015 and seven \nmonths of unemployment from February to September 2017, which the Judge noted left Applicant \n\u201cunable to initially pay the amounts due upon filing.\u201d Decision at 2. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment coincided with only three of his ten years of tax deficiencies, \nthe last of which was in 2017, and he has been consistently employed since then. While the Judge \nmay have reasonably determined that the unemployment was beyond Applicant\u2019s control and \ncontributed to his financial problems for a discrete number of tax years, it is wholly unclear how \nthose circumstances contributed to Applicant\u2019s tax deficiencies prior to his unemployment or how \nthey continue to impact his tax failures to-date.4 Rather, Applicant\u2019s tax delinquencies were \npredominantly caused by his failures to have sufficient amounts withheld from his pay or to pay \nhis tax obligations on a quarterly basis as required. Such failures were, by their nature, within his \ncontrol. See ISCR Case No. 06-19154, 2008 WL 2002588 at *3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008). \n3 AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; AG \u00b6 19(f): failure \nto file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required. \n4 Applicant bore the burden of establishing a nexus between his unemployment history and tax deficiencies. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-09304, 2008 WL 4917777 at *2 (App. Bd.

In finding that Applicant acted responsibly, the Judge relied \nexclusively on his repayment efforts, noting that \u201che is systematically paying his Federal and state \ntax debts.\u201d Decision at 6-7. Those repayment efforts also formed the basis of the Judge\u2019s \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d)5 and 20(g), both of which afford mitigation when an individual has \nconsistently engaged in resolution efforts, and which are also challenged by the Government. \nIn response to the Government\u2019s appeal, Applicant contends that the record establishes he \nis \u201cdoing everything that he can to resolve his situation.\u201d Reply Brief at 4. This is simply not true. \nTo his credit, the record reflects that Applicant has participated, with varying consistency, in \nseveral IRS installment agreements since approximately 20196 and a state installment agreement \nsince approximately 2020.7 While resolution efforts are properly considered in determining if an \nindividual acted responsibly in response to financial problems and such participation may open \nthe door for consideration of the other mitigation conditions, the evaluation of a security clearance \napplicant\u2019s reliability and judgment cannot hinge solely on whether he has taken corrective \nmeasures regarding the instant problem. Instead, such evaluation must also include consideration \nof the individual\u2019s reform and rehabilitation \u2013 i.e., his actions to prevent similar problems from \nrecurring. Indeed, once an individual understands how his behavior incurs a negative consequence, \nwe expect \u201cgood judgment\u201d to include modifying that behavior when and as possible. In this case, \nApplicant has decidedly made no such modification and the record is devoid of any evidence that \nhe has reformed his conduct. \nAs the Government highlights, Applicant has repeatedly failed to honor promises to \naddress his future tax obligations. In August 2021, he explained that his delinquencies resulted \nfrom having no taxes withheld from his pay and indicated his intent to begin paying quarterly taxes \nto avoid a significant year-end tax liability. GE 2 at 6. One year later, in July 2022, Applicant again \nacknowledged \u201clearning that I need to manage the allocations of my tax payments better \nthroughout the year.\u201d GE 2 at 3. Despite his assertions, his 2022 and 2023 prepared federal returns \nreflect that Applicant declined to modify his approach, made no such advanced payments, and \nowed his full tax obligation for those years. AE Z at 7; AE DD at 5. As of his March 2024 security \nclearance hearing, Applicant had still never paid quarterly taxes, despite acknowledging his ability \nto afford them. Tr. at 98, 102-103. He again expressed that he has \u201ca different plan going forward,\u201d \nto include payment of quarterly taxes. Tr. at 102. Years of similar broken promises strip his latest \nof credibility, and whatever credit the Judge afforded Applicant\u2019s promises to change his tax \npayment approach in the future was undue. See ISCR Case No. 17-01213, 2018 WL 3413537 at \n*3 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018) (citation omitted) (\u201c[A] promise to change one\u2019s conduct in the future \ndoes not constitute evidence of reform and rehabilitation that requires a favorable security \nclearance decision.\u201d). \n5 AG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n6 Applicant\u2019s current IRS installment agreement to address his 2018, 2019, and 2020 federal tax balances was \nestablished in approximately March 2022, and he has previously participated in other IRS installment agreements to \naddress his 2016, 2017, and 2018 federal tax balances.

Jun. 8, 2000) (\u201cIt is untenable for an applicant to refuse to \naccept his or her legal obligation to comply with the federal tax laws and then insist that the federal \ngovernment must grant him or her the privilege of handling classified information.\u201d). \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be \ncorrected through remand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon \ncorrection, such as when a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified \nerrors cannot be remedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. Such is the case when, after \naddressing the identified error, the Board concludes that a contrary formal finding or overall grant \nor denial of security clearance eligibility is the clear outcome based on the record.

On February 22, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has five charged-off debts totaling \nabout $43,000. Prior to hearing, the Government withdrew a Guideline E allegation that cross-\nalleged the same debts. The Judge found against Applicant on all of the Guideline F allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts two errors of fact in the Judge\u2019s decision.

He retired from the U.S. Navy in 2011 and remained \nunemployed before obtaining his current employment. While separated from his spouse, they both \naccumulated delinquent debts alleged in the SOR as a result of financial mismanagement and \nspending beyond their means. The Judge found that Applicant failed to act on two credit-card \ndebts; stopped payments on another credit-card debt that resulted in a default judgment and \ninvoluntary garnishment; and settled and paid two additional credit-card debts after they were \ncharged off in 2018. Applicant testified that he has not sought or received financial counseling. \nWhen asked why he had not sought counseling, he responded, \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little stubborn and I \ndon\u2019t like to have help.\u201d Tr. at 45. The Judge noted that Applicant paid $22,000 for a car for his \n16th\ndaughter\u2019s \nbirthday. In post-hearing submissions, Applicant resolved one debt via an \ninvoluntary garnishment, which does not qualify as a good-faith resolution, and he took no \nsignificant action to resolve four other debts until he realized that his security clearance was in \njeopardy. \nApplicant claims in his appeal that the Judge erred by stating he had no financial \ncounseling, stating that he had received financial counseling from the Navy before he retired but \nwas never able to implement the strategies suggested. Appeal Brief (AB) at 1. In testimony, \nDepartment Counsel asked Applicant, \u201cHave you ever received financial counseling?\u201d to which \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo sir.\u201d Applicant was then asked if he ever looked into financial \nmanagement or financial counseling though the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Applicant \nanswered, \u201cNo sir.\u201d When asked if he ever thought about it, he said he had, but he has not used \nsuch a program because \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little stubborn and I don\u2019t like to have help, I guess.\u201d Tr. at \n45. We find the Judge\u2019s decision is consistent with Applicant\u2019s testimony. With regard to \nadditional or clarifying evidence presented on appeal, the Appeal Board is prohibited from \nconsidering new evidence on appeal and does not review cases de novo. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant also contends the Judge erred by stating he bought a car for his daughter. \nApplicant\u2019s statement of error is correct, but harmless. In testimony, Applicant stated that he \nbought a new car \u201ca few months ago\u201d for \u201chimself,\u201d and he gave his other car to his daughter for \nher 16th birthday. Tr. at 48. The Judge\u2019s confusion regarding the possession of any particular \nvehicle is irrelevant to the ultimate findings with regard to Applicant\u2019s failure to resolve delinquent \ndebts in a timely manner. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nOn May 23, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat her conduct raised security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline K \n(Handing Protected Information), and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines. On July 20, 2022, Applicant submitted a response to \nthe SOR.  \nOn October 4, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information, and she appealed that revocation under the \nprovisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \nand Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum that DoD civilian and military personnel \nwhose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the date of \nthat memorandum, shall be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process as \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and she elected that process. On March 16, 2023, after \nconducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nJennifer I. Goldstein denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s \ndecision. \nFindings of Facts and Conclusions \nApplicant, who is in her 40s, served as a general engineer in her most recent employment \nfrom which she medically retired in December 2022. Appeal Brief at 1. The SOR alleged that she \nhas a history of workplace misconduct spanning four separate employers. In her analysis, the Judge \nsummarized the significant facts of the case as follows: \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nFrom 2012 through 2022, Applicant\u2019s employment-related conduct \ndemonstrated a history of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. First, while \nemployed by the Navy from 2011 to 2013, she received a letter of caution for failing \nto follow her supervisor\u2019s instructions and engaging in inappropriate behavior by \nalienating customers. She also violated base rules by bringing a cell phone into an \narea where cell phones were prohibited. Additionally, while working for Employer \nThree, Applicant was terminated for violating the employer\u2019s policy, demonstrating \nnegligence, disruptiveness, unprofessionalism, and for interjecting herself into \nthings not related to her job.  \nSimilarly, Applicant displayed this same type of conduct while working for \nEmployer Five. From September 2021 through her suspension in September 2022, \nshe blatantly disregarded the instruction of her supervisor at least 13 times. She was \nfirst counseled on her inappropriate and unprofessional behavior in September \n2021. Despite counseling, she failed to bring work-related concerns to her \nsupervisor as instructed in the counseling and sent multiple inappropriate emails to \nthe entire staff. She repeatedly used her government email address to send messages \nrelated to areas outside of her employment duties, even after being explicitly \ninstructed not to do so in writing at least four times. Her conduct, unrelated to her \nallegations of discrimination and retaliation, establishes a pattern of rule violations \nand demonstrates questionable judgment.  [Decision at 20-21.] \n* * * \nApplicant\u2019s disregard of her employers\u2019 directions is well documented and has been \nreported repeatedly over her career. Further, her conduct is recent. While she \nacknowledged at least one instance of improperly using her government email to \nobtain the DTRA [Defense Threat Reduction Agency] report, she failed to take \nresponsibility for her actions. She knew it was wrong to use her government email, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nyet she chose to do so repeatedly. Instead of accepting responsibility for her \nimproper actions, she blamed others and claimed she was being retaliated against.  \nHer conduct continues to reflect poorly on her judgment.  [Decision at 21.] \nGuideline K (Handling Protected Information) \nApplicant failed to follow the guidance of her supervisors when it came to \nhandling protected information while employed by Employers Three and Five.  \nWhile employed by Employer Three, she shared three proprietary documents in \nviolation of the employer\u2019s policies. While at Employer Five, she committed a \nseries of inappropriate actions with respect to protected information, including: \ncompiling OSINT [open-source intelligence] against the direction of her \nsupervisor; disseminating that compilation over an unclassified government email \nnetwork; and not using the proper CUI [controlled unclassified information] \nmarkings on that documentation. [Decision at 22.] \nNone of the Guideline K mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s misconduct, which is \nrecent and demonstrates a recurring pattern.  Disregarding repeated attempts of her supervisors to \nprovide her guidance, Applicant failed to comply with safeguards and failed to demonstrate a \npositive attitude toward discharging her security responsibilities. \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology) \nThe evidence shows she misused her government email on multiple \noccasions including contacting DTRA, and that she disseminated OSINT that she \ncollected. Applicant did so even though her actions were not part of her official \nduties, and she continued to do so even after she had been instructed by her \nsupervisor to cease such activities. Applicant acknowledged improperly using her \ngovernment email to contact DTRA.  [Decision at 23.] \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of her government email was unrelated to her assigned tasks. This \nconduct was a deliberate violation of her supervisor\u2019s directives to not engage in such activities \nusing Government assets. Applicant made no good-faith effort to correct her conduct.   \nDiscussion \nScope of Review \nThere is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error \nwith specificity, identify how the Judge committed factual or legal error, and cite to specific \nportions of the record supporting any alleged error. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.30 and E3.1.32. See also \nISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). The Appeal Board does not review a case \nde novo. Id. Instead, our scope of review is narrow, and we may not substitute our judgment for \nthat of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-07766 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006). More \nspecifically, the Board\u2019s scope of review is limited to deciding whether: (1) the Judge\u2019s findings \nof fact are supported by substantial evidence, which is defined in the next section; (2) the Judge \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomplied with the procedures required by Executive Order 10865 and the Directive; and (3) the \nJudge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32. \nA Judge\u2019s conclusions are often subjective in nature and are sustainable if they constitute \nreasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 25, 2019). See also ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2 (setting forth the standard applied in \nanalyzing whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions are erroneous). If an appealing party demonstrates \nfactual or legal error, then the Board must consider whether the error is harmful or harmless; \nwhether the Judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds; and, if the Judge\u2019s decision \ncannot be affirmed, whether it should be remanded or reversed. Id. at 3. See also Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.32 and E3.1.33. \nChallenges to the Findings of Fact \nAt the outset, it is noted that Applicant\u2019s brief applies the wrong standard of proof in \nchallenging the legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. In the beginning of her brief, \nApplicant correctly states that a Judge\u2019s findings of fact must be supported by \u201csubstantial \nevidence,\u201d i.e., such \u201crelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support \na conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3 and 10 (citing \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). Applicant further states, \u201c\u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 is \u2018more than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u2019\u201d Appeal Brief at 10 (quoting See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). Several times, however, Applicant incorrectly \napplies the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in challenging the Judge\u2019s specific findings, \nwhich undercuts her arguments. Appeal Brief at 11, 14. At this point, it also merits noting that \nDirective \u00b6 E.1.32.1 provides the Appeal Board shall give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations in reviewing the findings of fact. In her decision, the Judge concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201ccredibility is questionable.\u201d Decision at 25. Based on our review of the record, we \nfind no reason not to defer to that credibility determination. \nThe Judge found that Applicant violated Employer Three\u2019s policy by sharing proprietary \ndocuments with the Government client. Decision at 5. Applicant contends that the Government \npresented insufficient evidence to show that she mishandled proprietary information. Appeal Brief \nat 5, 10-11, 13-14, 16. Applicant argues that proprietary information involves a property interest \nand that the Judge \u201cprovides no rationale for how the disclosures constituted a property interest of \n[Employer Three].\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. We construe Applicant\u2019s argument as asserting that the \nGovernment failed to establish that the information in question was proprietary information. We \ndo not find this argument persuasive. \nAt the hearing, Applicant offered into evidence documents that established she mishandled \nEmployer Three\u2019s proprietary information. Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1-D. This included portions \nof a DoD Report of Investigation reflecting that Employer Three reported that Applicant \u201cviolated \n[its] policy by sharing [its] proprietary documents with the government client.\u201d Id. at 5. The Judge \ncould rely on the company\u2019s representations that the information at issue was propriety information \nwithout having the company disclose the exact nature of that information or, as Applicant claims, \nprove it had a property interest in that information. As the Board has previously stated, we give \ndeference to a company\u2019s findings and conclusions in its security investigations. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018). In the classified information context, we have \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstated that, \u201cbecause of the unique position of employers as actual administrators of classified \nprograms and the degree of knowledge possessed by them in any particular case, their \ndeterminations and characterizations regarding security violations are entitled to considerable \ndeference, and should not be discounted or contradicted without a cogent explanation.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 10-07070 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2012). The same reasoning applies to a company\u2019s \ndeterminations and characterizations regarding violations of its policies on the safeguarding and \nhandling of sensitive information, such as propriety information. In this regard, the Judge was not \nrequired to accept Applicant\u2019s claim that no proprietary information was shared (SOR Response \nat 15) and instead had to weigh that claim in light of all the record evidence. \nApplicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \u201ccompil[ed] OSINT \nagainst the direction of her supervisor; disseminat[ed] that compilation over an unclassified \ngovernment email network and [failed to use] the proper CUI markings on that documentation\u201d \n(Decision at 22) is contradicted by an earlier finding that \u2013 as summarized by Applicant \u2013 she only \n\u201cpossibly transmitted protected material.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11, 13, 14. This argument, however, \nmisconstrues the relied-upon finding and conflates two issues: 1) that Applicant transmitted \ncompiled material over an unclassified network without proper CUI markings; and 2) that by virtue \nof her compiling the material, even from open sources, she was potentially altering the \nclassification status of the compilation. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s summarized finding, the Judge \nfound that Applicant\u2019s command was concerned that she was compiling and sending OSINT \ninformation over an unclassified network and that \u201cby adding her own analysis to the open-source \nintelligence, it is possible to elevate the classification level from what was unclassified open-\nsource material to something of a higher classification.\u201d Decision at 9. Applicant appears to argue \nthat, because the evidence establishes only that she possibly altered the classification status of \nvarious material through her compilation, the Government failed to establish that her transmission \nof the material over an unclassified network was improper. This conclusion does not follow. The \nJudge\u2019s finding about the possible elevation of classification status of compiled open-source \nmaterial is well supported by the record, as is that Applicant was repeatedly instructed to stop \ncompiling and transmitting such material over an unclassified network, and that she disregarded \nthose instructions. See Tr.-1 at 61-62, 86-87, 123-124; Government Exhibit (GE) 8 at 1; GE 9 at \n1; GE 10 at 1; GE 14; AE 1-A at 326. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions that \nfollowed.  \nApplicant failed to show that any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were defective. From our \nreview of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings of a security concern are based on substantial \nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-02225 at 2-3. \nChallenges to the Conclusions \nApplicant\u2019s brief claims that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in \nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all the evidence and by not properly \napplying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. These arguments amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is a matter within the Judge\u2019s \nspecial province. See, e.g., Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 \n(1982). As the trier of fact, the Judge must use commonsense in evaluating the evidence and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsider the record as a whole. Directive \u00b6 6.3 and Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(c). The Judge is responsible \nfor resolving conflicts in the evidence and has discretion in weighing the evidence, both favorable \nand unfavorable. In analyzing the evidence, a Judge is not required to accept unrebutted testimony \nor other evidence uncritically or without considering it in relation to all relevant and material \nevidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0265 at 4, n. 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 1999). \nAn appealing party\u2019s lengthy or strong disagreements with the Judge\u2019s conclusions and \nwhole-person analysis are not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate error. To establish error, an \nappealing party must demonstrate the Judge\u2019s analysis or conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nIn her brief, Applicant raises several challenges to the Judge\u2019s analysis and conclusions. \nFor example, Applicant argues that the Judge did not place appropriate weight on her character \nevidence, including individuals who stated that Applicant was not difficult to work with; that she \nwas the target of attacks by people who were much less qualified; and that she was dismissed for \ntrying to follow the regulations. She further claims that she was not provided appropriate training \non OSINT and the proper channels for disseminating that information. In essence, Applicant is \nadvocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. The existence of mitigating evidence, \nhowever, does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision. In \nweighing the evidence, the Judge must decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the \nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nBased on our review, we conclude that none of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). Furthermore, contrary to Applicant\u2019s \nassertions, we also conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis satisfies the requirements of \nDirective \u00b6 6.3, in that the Judge evaluated Applicant\u2019s security-significant circumstances in light \nof the entirety of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02806 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, \n2015). \nClaim of Reprisal for Whistleblowing \nApplicant\u2019s brief asserts that adverse actions were taken against her, including the attempt \nto revoke her security clearance, because she voiced concerns over safety hazards, violations of \nregulations, and discrimination. She further states that \u201cthe process to revoke a security clearance \nwas never meant to circumvent legitimate methods of adjudicating employment disputes.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 1. \nPresidential Policy Directive-19 and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3341(j) provide protections to cleared \nFederal Government employees who are whistleblowers. These protections are implemented in \nDoDM 5200.02, which provides: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.3. PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION BY AFFECTING ELIGIBIILLTY \nFOR ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. \na. It is strictly prohibited to take, fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to \ntake any action affecting an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation as a reprisal for a protected disclosure of fraud, waste, or abuse \npursuant to Presidential Policy Directive/PPD 19. \nb. Employees may appeal actions affecting eligibility for access to classified \ninformation allegedly taken as a reprisal for a protected disclosure of fraud, waste, \nor abuse in violation of Presidential Policy Directive/PPD 19. \nc. All personnel security adjudicators, DOHA administrative judges (AJs), \nand Personnel Security Appeals Boards (PSABs) will, as part of their adjudication \nof an individual\u2019s eligibility, consider and resolve any claims of reprisal for \nwhistleblowing.  \nPPD-19 \u00b6 F(5) defines \u201cProtected Disclosure\u201d as an employee\u2019s disclosure to a supervisor \nin his or her chain of command, an Inspector General, or certain other officials of information that \nhe or she \u201creasonably believes evidences (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or (ii) gross \nmismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger \nto public health or safety\u201d as well as other disclosures identified in that Directive. Under 50 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3341(j)(4)(C), a Federal agency shall find a retaliation violation if the protected disclosure \u201cwas \na contributing factor in the adverse security clearance or access determination taken against the \nindividual, unless the agency demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have \ntaken the same action in the absence of such disclosure, giving the utmost deference to the agency\u2019s \nassessment of the particular threat to the national security interests of the United States in the \ninstant matter.\u201d See also Security Executive Agent Directive 9, Appellate Review of Retaliation \nRegarding Security Clearance and Access Determinations.  \nIn her decision, the Judge reviewed Applicant\u2019s whistleblower-reprisal claims to determine \nwhether they may have been a contributing factor in the review of her security clearance eligibility. \nAfter first identifying Applicant\u2019s various whistleblower reprisal complaints, the Judge concluded: \n[E]ven if those complaints were true, based on the entire record, I am satisfied that \nthe DOD CAS would have acted on [Applicant\u2019s] security clearance in the absence \nof her complaints. Her failure to follow supervisory instructions at Employers One \nand Five, conduct unbecoming of a federal employee, inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace of Employers Three and Five, and unapproved volunteer activity on \ngovernment time while working for Employer Five are sufficient to establish, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that the SOR would have been issued in the absence \nof her complaints. Her protected disclosures were not contributing factors in the \nadverse security access determination.  [Decision at 26-27.] \nIn this regard, it merits noting that Applicant\u2019s transmissions of OSINT over the \ncommand\u2019s unclassified computer network was one of several key security concerns that led to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe review of her security clearance eligibility. At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was \ninvolved in \u201cgray space\u201d or \u201cgray operations,\u201d which she explained was operating \u201cin between \nlines of official versus unofficial\u201d actions. Tr.-3 at 123; AE 27; Decision at 2-3. Some of her \u201cgray \noperation\u201d activities included supplying data to military intelligence groups, helping to map flight \npaths, and assisting individuals with visas to come to the United States from a war-torn country. \nId. \nThe record evidence sets forth several instances in which Applicant transmitted OSINT \nunrelated to her official responsibilities over the command\u2019s unclassified computer network in \nviolation of supervisory instructions, directions, and orders. Some notable events regarding this \nissue are summarized below. \na. On December 20, 2021, Applicant was issued a letter of reprimand, in part, for misusing \nher Government email account by sending emails unrelated to her professional duties. These \nemails concerned container ships entering the United States. In one of those emails, Applicant \nindicated that she knew individuals who could assist in conducting reconnaissance of these ships. \nDecision at 9-11; GE 4 at 2; GE 7 at 1. \nb. On February 16, 2022, Applicant sent an email to her supervisor, an intelligence officer, \nand other senior members of Employer Five over the command\u2019s unclassified network that \ndiscussed hypersonic threats at certain locations outside the United States. Decision at 12. In a \nrelated memorandum for the record, Applicant\u2019s supervisor noted that Applicant is not assigned \nto the intelligence field, that intelligence professionals within the command expressed concerns \nabout Applicant transmitting \u201cthreat assessments\u201d over the unclassified network, and that they \nrecommended she confine such transmissions to the classified network. GE 8 at 1. The day after \nreceiving Applicant\u2019s email, her supervisor replied and instructed Applicant to refrain from \nsending such emails over the unclassified network \u201cto mitigate classification, OPSEC [operational \nsecurity], and OSINT concerns.\u201d Id. Based on her supervisor\u2019s email, Applicant should have \nunderstood that transmitting OSINT over the unclassified network with her comments or analysis \nraised issues about whether such actions elevated that information to the level of classified \ninformation and, thereby, created a security violation. Approximately five minutes after her \nsupervisor\u2019s response, Applicant replied by stating the information was gathered from open \nsources. Id. About three hours later, Applicant disobeyed her supervisor by sending an email \nregarding a country involved in a military conflict; however, she did not include her supervisor on \nthat email. Id. Shortly after receipt of this latter email, an intelligence officer replied directly to \nApplicant, noting that her email\u2019s contents should have been restricted to the classified network, \nher comments were not related to the command\u2019s mission, and, if collection of open-source \nintelligence was required, specially trained OSINT professionals would perform that function. In \nthe memorandum for the record, her supervisor indicated that Applicant\u2019s conduct was \nunacceptable and posed a potential threat to national security.  Id. at 2. \nc. On February 24, 2022, the command\u2019s Operations Director notified Applicant that her \naccess to classified information was being suspended. GE 9. Of note, the Operations Director was \nneither in Applicant\u2019s chain of command nor apparently involved in any of her protected \ndisclosures. The Operations Director\u2019s memorandum indicated that the suspension was based on \nvarious instances of Applicant\u2019s questionable conduct, including her transmission of OSINT over \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe command\u2019s unclassified network. The Operations Director also notified her that an incident \nreport must be submitted to DoD CAS, that he was taking that action in his capacity as the Security \nProgram Executive, and that DoD CAS would make a final determination concerning her security \nclearance eligibility. Id. \nd. Despite being directed by her supervisor and an intelligence officer not to transmit \nOSINT over the unclassified network and being advised by the Operations Director that her access \nto classified information was suspended, in part, for making such transmissions, Applicant again \nused the command\u2019s unclassified network for the transmission of OSINT. On March 30, 2022, \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor sent her a memorandum that directed her to cease and desist using her \n\u201cgovernment electronic mail (email) account to collect, transmit, compile, consolidate or otherwise \nredistribute open source intelligence . . . information, and tactical information.\u201d GE 10 at 1. This \nmemo advised her that she is not an intelligence officer and that her responsibilities did not require \nher to engage in open-source intelligence gathering, analysis, or transmission. It was issued after \nher supervisor became aware that Applicant sent two emails on her Government computer on \nMarch 3, 2022, that were unrelated to her official duties. These emails were apparently sent in her \nunofficial \u201cgray operation\u201d role. One of them asked a DTRA contractor to send her information \nabout a power plant fire in a country involved in a military conflict. Her supervisor\u2019s memo noted \nthat their command\u2019s mission did not involve getting DTRA intelligence products to end users and \nthat Applicant\u2019s use of her official Government email in making that request created the \nimpression that her request was part of her official duties. Id. \ne. On May 2, 2022, Applicant sent an email regarding hypersonics that contained an excel \nspreadsheet and other documents. This email resulted in Applicant\u2019s government computer, as \nwell as those of 17 other employees, being seized so that a review could be conducted to determine \nwhether her email created a spillage of classified information over the unclassified network. \nDecision at 15; AE 1-A at 326. Due to this incident, Applicant\u2019s access to DoD networks, DoD \ninformation technology assets, and common access card were suspended. Decision at 15. It also \nresulted in Applicant\u2019s supervisor and the Director of Information Production issuing her a cease\u00ad\nand-desist order on May 18, 2022, prohibiting Applicant from communicating hypersonic \ninformation in any format. AE 1-A at 326. The official review of this potential spillage incident \nlater determined that Applicant\u2019s email contained only CUI and should have been marked \naccordingly. Decision at 17; GE 14. \nf. On May 31, 2022, Applicant\u2019s supervisor issued her a directive that prohibited her from \nusing government-duty time or government resources for intelligence collection, transmission, or \nrelated activities. This directive was generated after Applicant sought contact information on \nintelligence personnel so that she could pass along a tip concerning Taliban activity. AE 1-E at \n321. Applicant violated this directive on June 23, 2022, when she approached an official within \nher division to inform him that she had intelligence information on foreign nationals and possibly \nU.S. persons that required urgent attention, showing him images of passports on her cell phone. \nDecision at 16.  \nApplicant\u2019s contention that the actions taken to revoke her security clearance were in \nretaliation for her being a whistleblower is not supported by the evidence. Besides her bare reprisal \nassertion, she failed to provide any specifics about that claim. In particular, she does not explain \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher basis for believing a reprisal occurred, does not highlight any portions of the record evidence \nthat would support her claim, and does not assert that the Judge committed any factual or legal \nerror in making findings of fact or conclusions regarding this issue.  \nWe agree with the Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding Applicant\u2019s reprisal claims. Based on our \nreview of the record, we conclude that Applicant\u2019s purported protected disclosures were not a \ncontributing factor in the initiation of the actions taken to revoke her security clearance eligibility \nor in the ultimate unfavorable security clearance determination. Furthermore, a preponderance of \nthe evidence in this case demonstrates that DoD would have taken action to revoke Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility even if her protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the \ninitiation of the review of her clearance eligibility. \nConclusion \nApplicant has a history of employment-related misconduct at four employers, including \nboth private companies and the Federal Government, between 2012 and 2022. This misconduct is \nwell documented. The record evidence sufficiently establishes that she has engaged in a pattern of \ninappropriate workplace behavior, such as failing to follow instructions, interjecting herself into \nmatters that did not involve her, making threatening or disparaging comments, engaging in \ndisruptive behavior, and exhibiting conduct unbecoming a Federal employee. For example, \nApplicant claimed a commanding officer\u2019s executive assistant had threatened her life in 2013, but \nan ensuing investigation found that Applicant\u2019s allegations were unsubstantiated and \u201cwere \nspecifically repudiated and contradicted by the collective weight of the statements of ten \nwitnesses.\u201d Decision at 4 (quoting AE 1-B at 245). Applicant\u2019s employment history also reveals \nthat she was terminated from a fifth job with a state government, although there is no SOR \nallegation pertaining to that employment. She has repeatedly claimed that corrective or disciplinary \nactions taken by employers were reprisals against her for being a whistleblower; however, she has \nnot shown that any of those claims were substantiated by appropriate investigating authorities. \nParticularly troubling is her use of Government resources to engage in intelligence gathering \nactivities for her unofficial \u201cgray operations,\u201d and her failure to follow official orders related to \nsuch unofficial activities. She mishandled proprietary information while working at Employer \nThree. Her conduct demonstrates that she was unwilling to comply with supervisory instructions, \ndirections, or orders, which raises doubts about her willingness to follow rules, regulations, and \nsupervisory orders regarding the protection of classified or sensitive information. In general, \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct is recent, frequent, and raises security concerns about her trustworthiness, \nreliability, and good judgment. The ultimate burden of persuasion was on Applicant to obtain a \nfavorable clearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. We agree with the Judge that Applicant failed \nto mitigate the alleged security concerns. In particular, she failed to show that her various types of \nworkplace misconduct are unlikely to recur. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that she should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 9, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 6, 2023, \nafter considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Marc \nE. Curry concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 15 collection accounts totaling $37,049. Twelve of the accounts are for \nFederal student loans, two are for state education loans, and one is a credit card account. Applicant \nadmitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. She acknowledged receipt of the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM on February 1, 2023, but she did not provide a substantive response.

She \nis a high-school graduate and attended college from 2015 to 2017. She is employed by a defense \ncontractor since June 2021. Applicant was unemployed from December 2019 to May 2020. The \nJudge found that Applicant did not make payments toward her delinquent debts before December \n2019 or between May 2021 and January 2023, nor did she discuss payments made or other efforts \nshe undertook to resolve her debts before May 2021. During her October 2021 personal subject \ninterview, she indicated that she had retained a credit repair agency to assist her with her student \nloan debts, but she failed to provide details of the agency agreement, status of the debts, or progress \nmade toward their resolution. \nThe Judge found that Applicant made payments on six accounts after the SOR was issued \nto bring them into a current status, but that the remaining debts were unresolved despite her claim \nin the Answer to the SOR that she was paying down debts and working with creditors to reduce \nher balances. The Judge held that, although she made payments since the SOR was issued on debts \nin which he found in her favor, there is no record evidence of how much she paid to get those loans \nout of a delinquent status, despite having $2,780 of monthly discretionary income since May 2021. \nHe held that her remaining debts have not been mitigated. \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the date listed in the decision for when she graduated from \nhigh school. This amounts to harmless error. She also stressed that she acknowledged receipt of \nthe FORM, which she believes is contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding that, \u201cApplicant did not file a \nresponse [to the FORM].\u201d Applicant appears to confuse submitting a receipt with providing a \nsubstantive response to the FORM, including any evidence in mitigation. \nApplicant now provides additional background information and argues that the Judge did \nnot adequately consider the circumstances surrounding the accrual of her delinquencies or her \nefforts to address her debts through a debt resolution firm and payments. She also argues that she \nprovided evidence to the Government investigator during her interview, but she was not asked to \nprovide her credit repair company retainer agreement. She attached it and other new evidence to \nher appeal. The Appeal Board does not review cases de novo and is prohibited from considering \nnew evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant\u2019s contention that the Judge did not adequately consider the circumstances \nsurrounding the accrual of her delinquencies or her efforts to address her debts through a debt \nresolution firm are not supported by the record. She contends that she did not make payments \nbetween May 2021 and January 2023 because Federal student loan payments were suspended \nduring that time. Although not discussed by the Judge, payments on Federal student loans were \ndeferred from March 13, 2020, until September 2023 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See \nhttps://studentaid.gov/ announcements-events/covid-19 (2024). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe length of time a debt is delinquent is a factor to consider in assessing the security \nconcerns arising from that debt. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02219 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2021), \naffirming unfavorable clearance decisions involving student loans deferred during the COVID-19 \npandemic because those loans were delinquent for significant periods before that deferment \nbecame effective. In this case, the record supports the finding that Applicant\u2019s student loans were \ndelinquent prior to the Government-wide COVID-19 deferral. GE 3-6. No evidence was submitted \nto show that state-sponsored student loans were similarly deferred. Applicant\u2019s credit reports show \nthat the last activity on her student loans generally date from 2007 to 2018, coinciding with the \ntwo periods in which she attended college. Her credit-card delinquency dated to 2019. GE 3-7. \nApplicant admitted in her 2021 interview regarding her student loans, that she \u201cdoes not \nrecall when she stopped making the payments, but she stopped because she wasn\u2019t making enough \nmoney from her employment.\u201d GE 7. She now argues that the Judge did not consider her personal \nand professional difficulties in his decision and seeks a reevaluation of her case. In a DOHA \nproceeding, it is an applicant\u2019s job to present evidence sufficient to mitigate the concerns raised in \nhis or her case, and the applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion that he or she should be \ngranted a clearance. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15; See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. \n30, 2018). \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). The scope of \nGuideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, but also extends to \nhis or her financial history. Although Applicant engaged the services of a debt relief firm, the \nresults of that engagement, if any, were not submitted to the Judge for consideration. Additionally, \nother efforts to resolve her delinquent loans before the deferment period were also not submitted \nto be included in evidence. \nWe find that the Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances and modest debt-resolution \nefforts in his decision and reasonably concluded she had not established a record of payments or \ndebt rehabilitation such that he could find that her financial problems are under control and \nunlikely to recur. Decision at 4. Applicant\u2019s advocacy for an alternative weighing of the evidence \nis not sustainable. An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an \nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the \njudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record \nevidence. The mere presence of some favorable or mitigating evidence does not require the Judge \nto make an overall favorable determination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as \nApplicant\u2019s. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). The Judge\u2019s conclusion \nthat Applicant failed to mitigate the financial security concerns is sustainable. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Our review of the Judge\u2019s decision confirms that he considered all relevant issues and \nproperly applied the mitigating conditions. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact relevant to allegations found against \nApplicant: Applicant is a 33-year-old network systems administrator employed by a federal \ncontractor since May 2022. When previously employed by a commercial bank, he was terminated \nfor repeated tardiness. His employment with an apartment rental agency was terminated for not \nfollowing the procedures for completing resident surveys, and he also was terminated from \nemployment at a call center for not meeting company goals and objectives. His current employer \nrated him as a \"solid contributor\" although he needed improvement in following directions and \narriving on time to work and meetings. Two coworkers attested to Applicant\u2019s proficiency, \nproblem-solving skills, honesty, and sincerity. \nApplicant gave \"a good friend\" access to his PayPal account so that he could purportedly \ntransfer funds to his girlfriend, although Applicant admitted that he did not know his friend's last \nname and did not know where he lived. His friend paid Applicant about $150 - $200 in exchange \nfor access to his account information and then used the account to steal between $4,000 and $5,000 \nfrom credit-card and debit-card accounts of other PayPal users. Applicant learned of the thefts \nwhen PayPal notified him of what appeared to be unauthorized use. Applicant did not notify law \nenforcement authorities about the compromise of his PayPal account or tell PayPal that he had \ngiven his friend access to the account. Applicant was not charged with any criminal conduct, and \nhe listed the PayPal fraud in his Security Clearance Application. There is no evidence that \nApplicant was directly involved in the thefts and there is no evidence showing that he was an \naccomplice in the PayPal fraud. Subsequently, Applicant was the victim of a separate scheme in \nwhich he agreed to cash a check for a stranger in return for compensation, only to discover that \nthe check was fraudulent. \nThe Judge concluded that because Applicant was not directly involved in the PayPal fraud, \nGuideline F Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 19(d) was not established. However, under Guideline E, \nthe Judge found that Applicant's na\u00efve facilitation of the PayPal fraud demonstrated a serious lack \nof good judgment that was unmitigated. He also concluded that Applicant\u2019s employment \nterminations were due to his unwillingness to follow rules. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nApplicant alleges the following specific factual errors in the decision: that the Judge \nerroneously concluded that Applicant demonstrated a second instance of poor judgment because, \nafter the PayPal incident, he fell for a check-cashing scam; that the Judge's opinion usurps his \nemployer's favorable opinion of Applicant; and that the Judge made contradictory findings when \nhe concluded under Guideline F that Applicant did not directly engage in fraud but that Applicant\u2019s \ninvolvement demonstrated poor judgment under Guideline E. AB at 7. Although Applicant frames \nhis arguments as factual errors, the challenges conflate \"facts\" with \"conclusions.\" \nApplicant\u2019s focus on the Judge\u2019s comment that Applicant did not learn from the PayPal \nevent because he subsequently engaged in a questionable check cashing scam is misplaced. AB at \n7-8. We do not evaluate a Judge's decision based on isolated words or sentences but, rather, on the \ndecision viewed as a whole. ISCR Case No. 20-00204 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2022). Applicant\u2019s \nacknowledgement that the chronology of events is unclear favors deference to the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion. But regardless of whether Applicant\u2019s involvement took place shortly before or after \nthe PayPal incident, the significance of that event is that it reflects another instance of Applicant\u2019s \nexercise of poor judgment by unquestioningly engaging in a financial transaction that, at the very \nleast, required due diligence in investigating its legitimacy and legality. A Judge may consider \nnon-alleged conduct (a) in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in considering whether the \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole-person \nconcept. E.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01038 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2013). Nothing in the record or the \nJudge\u2019s decision indicates that he considered Applicant\u2019s role in the second scam in a manner that \nis inconsistent with this analytical approach. \nIn reaching his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s employment terminations reflect an \nunwillingness to follow rules, the Judge\u2019s factual findings acknowledged the favorable comments \nby his current employer. However, Applicant\u2019s workplace conduct is more relevant to the \nadjudication of his suitability for access to classified information than are his professional skills \nor his value to his employer. The purpose of a clearance adjudication is to assess judgment and \nreliability, not workplace competency. ISCR Case No. 04-11893 at 7 (App. Bd. Apr. 25, 2006). It \nwas not unreasonable for the Judge to focus on the fact that Applicant\u2019s most recent performance \nappraisal reflects that he demonstrates a pattern of tardiness and failure to follow procedures, \nwhich is consistent with the reasons he was terminated by other employers. See ISCR Case No. \n11-06622 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012) (Guideline E analysis properly focused on Applicant's \ndisdain for complex paperwork, which evidenced a knowing and willful failure to comply with \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrules or regulations). This reflects ongoing conduct that is particularly relevant inasmuch as \nApplicant points out it has been seven years since the last adverse disciplinary action. The Judge\u2019s \nfindings are substantially supported by the evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that, because the Judge found favorably under Guideline F, he must \nfind in Applicant\u2019s favor under Guideline E is a non-sequitur and fails to recognize the alleged \nconduct raises different concerns under the two Guidelines. An SOR allegation may be included \nunder more than one Guideline and may be given independent weight under each. Furthermore, a \nfinding of mitigation under one Guideline does not compel a similar finding under another. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 08-07575 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 8, 2010). By focusing on the concepts of questionable \njudgment and irresponsibility, the Guidelines contemplate that behavior will have independent \nsecurity significance under Guideline E. ISCR Case No. 06-20964 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008); \nISCR Case No. 04-09251 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007) (holding that a favorable finding under \nGuideline M did not preclude an adverse finding under Guideline E regarding the same underlying \nconduct). \nThe Judge\u2019s analysis and conclusions under Guideline F have no bearing or relationship to \nhis Guideline E analysis because each Guideline addresses a different concern. The crux of the \nallegation under Guideline F is whether Applicant was a party to the financial fraud. Under \nGuideline E, the crux of the allegation addressed Applicant\u2019s \u201cpoor choices [that] gave another \nperson the ability to commit fraud\u201d by allowing that individual access to his PayPal account. \nDecision at 6. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was not involved in the actual commission \nof the fraud is not inconsistent with his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s involvement in the chain of \nevents nevertheless reflected poor judgment. An applicant who does not behave prudently when \nfaced with certain facts prior to participating in a facially preposterous venture cannot be said to \nhave exercised sound judgment. See ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 4 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016); ISCR \nCase No. 10-02803 at 6, Fn. 9 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. \nAn applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for \na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, there is a rebuttable \npresumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states \notherwise, and a bare assertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut \nthat presumption. E.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). The Judge is not \nrequired to discuss every aspect of the evidence in his decision. E.g. ISCR Case No. 03-07874 at \n4 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2005). \nWe have considered the entirety of Applicant\u2019s arguments. The record supports a \nconclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).

Thereafter, Applicant worked for two years as a police officer with another government agency, where he received three promotions before becoming a DCSA background investigator. In August 2021, in response to a routine re-contact letter, one of four sources that Applicant claimed to have interviewed as part of a background investigation reported that she had never spoken with Applicant. The DCSA OIG initiated an investigation and contacted the source, who reiterated that Applicant never interviewed her, and provided discrepant information from what Applicant had reported of the interview in the ROI. DCSA OIG subsequently contacted the three other sources identified in the ROI to validate their testimonies. All three confirmed with certainty that they were never interviewed by Applicant and, once again, all three provided discrepant information from what Applicant reported of their respective interviews in the ROI. Telephone records for Applicant\u2019s government cell phone did not reflect calls to the four sources.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged concerns arising from a September 2021 investigation conducted by the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Office of the Inspector General (OIG), \nwhich revealed that, while employed as a DCSA background investigator, Applicant submitted \nfalse or inaccurate entries in a Report of Investigation (ROI), reported conducting personal source \ninterviews that did not occur, and inaccurately reported other pertinent investigative information. \nAs a result of these findings, Applicant\u2019s access to classified information was suspended. \nThe Judge found against Applicant and, for the reasons stated below, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-30s. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree Summa Cum Laude in 2013 \nwith a major in criminal justice and concentration in forensic investigations. Thereafter, Applicant \nworked for two years as a police officer with another government agency, where he received three \npromotions before becoming a DCSA background investigator. \nIn August 2021, in response to a routine re-contact letter, one of four sources that Applicant \nclaimed to have interviewed as part of a background investigation reported that she had never \nspoken with Applicant. The DCSA OIG initiated an investigation and contacted the source, who \nreiterated that Applicant never interviewed her, and provided discrepant information from what \nApplicant had reported of the interview in the ROI. DCSA OIG subsequently contacted the three \nother sources identified in the ROI to validate their testimonies. All three confirmed with certainty \nthat they were never interviewed by Applicant and, once again, all three provided discrepant \ninformation from what Applicant reported of their respective interviews in the ROI. \nTelephone records for Applicant\u2019s government cell phone did not reflect calls to the four \nsources. He explained that his government phone had poor service at his residence and so he \nreceived authorization to use his personal phone to conduct interviews; however, Applicant \ndecided to use prepaid telephones for the interview calls instead of his personal phone, which made \nit impossible for him to prove that he called the four sources. Applicant also averred that his notes \nfrom the calls, which contained details such as the dates and names of individuals contacted, were \nunavailable, having been destroyed after the ROI was completed. Applicant maintained that the \nsubject ROI accurately reflected what sources told him, and that he complied with investigative \npolicies on the identification of witnesses he interviewed. He suggested that someone may have \nimpersonated the four sources, may have simply agreed with Applicant\u2019s comments to appease \nhim, or may have lied to Applicant, the OIG, or both. \nThe Judge found that Applicant is \u201can intelligent, well trained, and knowledgeable \ninvestigator\u201d who \u201cunderstands the investigative standards for reporting interviews in reports.\u201d \nDecision at 8. He concluded that Applicant \u201cknowingly and intentionally fabricated the interviews \nof [the four sources] in an ROI\u201d and that such fabrication \u201creflects untrustworthy and unreliable \nbehavior, constitutes a pattern of dishonesty, and . . . adversely affects his \u2018personal, professional, \nand community standing.\u2019\u201d Decision at 8. The Judge also found that Applicant\u2019s continued denial \nof fabricating the four interview summaries was not credible, showed a lack of rehabilitation, and \nweighed against mitigation of the personal conduct security concerns. Decision at 9-10. As a result \nof the foregoing, Applicant could not \u201cbe trusted to disclose potentially derogatory security-related \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about himself that might jeopardize security,\u201d and he \u201cdid not establish his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d Decision at 11. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s \u201clanguage in the decision . . . incorrectly \nimpl[ies] wrongdoing on [his] part,\u201d and that \u201cthis incorrect implication of wrongdoing resulted in \nunfair prejudice when rendering a decision in this case.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Specifically, Applicant \nfirst takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that he \u201cdid not make detailed notes of the contents of the \ncalls\u201d and asserts that, to the contrary, he \u201cmaintained notes of the interviews that contained all \nrequired information and they were as detailed as required by DCSA policy.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. \nApplicant testified at hearing that, per his training, he logged the date and name of the \nindividual contacted; he did not log the time he called or how long the call lasted. Tr. at 31-32. \nThe extent of his description of the substance of his calls was that he: \nwould ask two pages worth of notes, but what would be reported \nwould just be so and so had contact with so and so . . . so many days \nof the week as teacher, neighbor, whatever. And then, if there\u2019s no \nissue[,] information included that would affect that person\u2019s \nclearance, then nothing else gets reported. \nTr. at 38. The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \u201cdid not make detailed notes of the content of the \ncalls\u201d constitutes a reasonable inference from the record before him and we find no error in it. \nDecision at 5.  \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that his \u201cnotes are not available because they \nwere destroyed after the ROI was completed,\u201d and contends that he \u201cdid not personally destroy \nthe notes in [his] case file after the ROI was completed,\u201d but rather \u201cturned [his] case files, \nincluding [his] notes from these interviews, into [his] field office as required by DCSA policy, \nwhere they are maintained by the field office Investigative Assistant and the Special Agent in \nCharge until they are destroyed at a later time by one of those individuals after the case has been \nadjudicated and a required waiting period has passed.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. However, the Judge\u2019s \nfinding about the notes\u2019 disposition does not indicate, either implicitly or explicitly, that Applicant \nwas responsible for their destruction and consequential unavailability. Once again, we find no error \nin this finding. The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are \u201cbased upon substantial \nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the \nevidence,\u201d and Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings. See ISCR Case No. \n12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nFinally, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to adequately consider \u201cthat it was the \nDCSA\u2019s decision . . . to have source interviews conducted solely by telephone with no way of \npositively identifying a source being interviewed, and despite having data showing that interviews \nconducted by telephone are at much higher risk of obtaining inaccurate information.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 1. As an initial matter, the Board is unclear to which \u201cdata\u201d Applicant refers. While he testified \nat length to his opinion that telephonic interviews are inferior to those conducted in-person, we see \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnothing in the record regarding data to substantiate his opinion. Additionally, this argument \namounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, \n2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence supports that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On July 13, 2021, Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR and indicated that he would not submit a reply.  \nOn October 3, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under the provisions \nof DoD Manual (DoDM) 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense \n(Intelligence & Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum shall be provided the opportunity to pursue the DOHA hearing and \nappeal process set forth in the Directive.

Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nFindings of Facts and Conclusions \nApplicant, who is in his 50s, has been employed by DoD agencies since 2015. He served \nin the military and retired in paygrade E-7. He has held a security clearance for many years. He is \ndivorced with three children. He is entitled to receive child support payments from his ex-wife, \nwho is about $60,000 behind on those payments. His current annual salary is about $113,000, and \nhe has a net monthly remainder of about $6,000 to $7,000. Applicant \u201ctestified that he could not \npoint to anything specific that caused him to fall behind on his bills, except that he overextended \nhimself. (Tr. 32) He admitted that some of his debts had \u2018fallen off the radar\u2019 until he was notified \nthat his hearing was being scheduled. (Tr. 46)\u201d Decision at 3.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling about $29,600. In late \n2022, Applicant paid two of those debts (Debt # 6 for $194 and Debt #8 for $124). In early 2023, \nhe entered into payment agreements on five of the debts, promised to pay the balances in monthly \nincrements, but did not progress beyond making the initial payments on them. The Judge \nconcluded that Debt #5 was unresolved, and Applicant\u2019s actions regarding six of the other debts \nwere not taken until he learned his security clearance was in jeopardy. \u201cPayments in response to \nthe pressure of qualifying for a security clearance are not made in \u2018good faith\u2019 within the meaning \nof [Mitigating Condition 20(d)].\u201d Decision at 6. Applicant failed to demonstrate a track record of \nfinancial responsibility sufficient to mitigate the alleged security concerns. \nDiscussion \nBias and Impartiality \nInterspersed throughout Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is the claim that the Judge was biased \nagainst him. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party \nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. See, e. g., ISCR \nCase No. 03-07245 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 20, 2005). Bias is not demonstrated merely because a \nJudge reached adverse conclusions or found against the appealing party. Moreover, bias is not \ndemonstrated merely because a party can demonstrate a Judge committed a factual or legal error. \nThe standard is not whether a party personally believes a Judge was biased or prejudiced against \nthat party, but rather whether the record of the proceedings below contains any indication that the \nJudge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable, disinterested person to question the fairness \nand impartiality of the Judge. Id. In this case, Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion on \nthis issue.  \nAs a related matter, Applicant also contends that the adverse decision was based on the \nJudge\u2019s \u201cextreme . . . personal opinions versus the actual facts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. We find no \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmerit in this argument and, based on our review, conclude the Judge\u2019s decision was a fair and \nreasonable application of the pertinent Guideline F disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nfacts in this case. \nWeighing of the Evidence \nIn general, Applicant\u2019s appeal arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence. For example, Applicant notes that his delinquent debts \u201chappened over \n6 years ago and there is no evidence that there is a frequency nor recurring financial infractions.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1. However, an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018). Applicant further \nargues that he could not be compromised due to his financial problems, that there is no evidence \nhe poses a threat to the national interest, and that the security concerns reflected in other \nadjudicative guidelines do not apply to him. To the extent that he is arguing his financial problems \ndo not raise security concerns, we do not find that argument persuasive.  It is well established that \na history of financial problems and an inability to satisfy debts may raise security concerns under \nGuideline F. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c). For example, the Guideline F security \nconcerns encompass the risk that applicants who are financially irresponsible might also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  \nIn essence, Applicant is arguing for an alternative interpretation of the record evidence. \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable \nsecurity clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole \nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A \nparty\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). In short, we find no error in the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns \narising from the alleged debts. \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted an exception under Directive, Encl. 2, App. C. The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on \nthe record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. Applicant is in his early sixties and divorced, with two teenaged children. He served in the military from 1981 to 2001 and has held a security clearance for about 40 years. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in a technical area and has received \u201can exceptional amount of information security training over several decades.\u201d Decision at 2. The SOR alleges 13 delinquent accounts totaling about $103,000. Applicant testified that his financial problems initially arose from several factors that included his 2012 divorce, child support obligations, and medical issues in 2018. Id. at 4. Then, beginning in 2017 or 2018, Applicant became the victim of an online romance scheme. In a situation involving stolen identity, Applicant was led to believe that he was communicating with a female U.S. soldier serving in Afghanistan whom he knew as Staff Sergeant (SSG) A. Over a two-to-three-year period, SSG A encouraged Applicant to borrow approximately $100,000 and to deposit the funds in bank accounts belonging to her purported relatives. Applicant did so, believing that he and SSG A would live together upon her return from deployment.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nOn August 2, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines. On December 28, 2021, Applicant submitted a reply. \nOn October 3, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under the provisions \nof DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence & Security) \nRonald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military personnel whose \nclearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the date of that \nmemorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process set forth in \nDoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and he elected that process. Tr. at 7. On March 13, 2023, \nafter a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Mark Harvey \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. He contends that the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, \nrendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. \nApplicant is in his early sixties and divorced, with two teenaged children. He served in the \nmilitary from 1981 to 2001 and has held a security clearance for about 40 years. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in a technical area and has received \u201can exceptional amount of information \nsecurity training over several decades.\u201d Decision at 2. \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent accounts totaling about $103,000. Applicant testified that \nhis financial problems initially arose from several factors that included his 2012 divorce, child \nsupport obligations, and medical issues in 2018. Id. at 4. Then, beginning in 2017 or 2018, \nApplicant became the victim of an online romance scheme. In a situation involving stolen identity, \nApplicant was led to believe that he was communicating with a female U.S. soldier serving in \nAfghanistan whom he knew as Staff Sergeant (SSG) A. Over a two-to-three-year period, SSG A \nencouraged Applicant to borrow approximately $100,000 and to deposit the funds in bank accounts \nbelonging to her purported relatives. Applicant did so, believing that he and SSG A would live \ntogether upon her return from deployment. When SSG A\u2019s return to the United States was \nrepeatedly delayed, Applicant became suspicious, made inquiries to the military unit, and \nultimately discovered that SSG A did not exist. Applicant acknowledged that he was the victim of \na scam known as \u201ccatfishing.\u201d Id. He was unaware that his funds were being sent to Ghana until \nhe saw the report of investigation for his security clearance. \nIn his April 2021 background interview for his clearance investigation, Applicant stated \nhis intent to file for bankruptcy. Upon his subsequent discovery that he did not qualify for Chapter \n7 bankruptcy, Applicant stated his intent to file under Chapter 13 instead. After losing his federal \nemployment in February 2022, Applicant is again pursuing Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted in pertinent part. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant did not provide proof either that \nhe made any payments on the 13 delinquent SOR debts or that he established payment plans. \nAlthough it was \u201cprudent and reasonable\u201d for Applicant to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy in late 2021 \nor early 2022, he did not exercise due diligence in establishing a bankruptcy payment plan. Id. at \n12. Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2023 was \u201ctoo little too late.\u201d Id. \n[Applicant] indicated most of his delinquent debts were due to him being the victim \nof an Internet scam where SSG A\u2019s identity was used in a scheme over a two-year \nperiod to steal about $100,000 from him. He never talked to SSG A.

Applicant is a 60-year-old expert in information technology with decades of \nexperience. He has security training. SSG A had access to a computer and the \nInternet and was stationed in a major Afghan city, Kabul. Her claims that she was \nunable to call him on the telephone, access her accounts for two years, and was \nunable to return to the United States for two years were transparently false. Her \nsuggested method of transferring funds from Applicant to her by using multiple \naccounts under different names should also have raised a red flag. [Id. at 11.] \n\u201cBeing a victim of a crime is a circumstance beyond an Applicant\u2019s control when an \nApplicant shows reasonable judgment.\u201d Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. July \n7, 2016)). The Appeal Board has held that an applicant who is defrauded \u201cby means of a facially \npreposterous real estate scheme cannot fairly claim that [his] debts arose from circumstances \noutside [his] control or that [he] otherwise exhibited sound judgment in the handling of [his] \nfinances.\u201d Id. at 12, quoting ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3\u20134. In this case, Applicant did not act \nreasonably or exhibit sound judgment in his payments to SSG A. Id. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by mis-weighing the evidence, and by not \nproperly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. \nMost notably, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cclearly misweighed [Applicant\u2019s] \ntestimony and reasoning for his involvement in the \u2018catfish\u2019 scam which led to his financial \ndetriment.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. Applicant contends that the Judge failed to give proper weight to \nthe fact that he was \u201cmisled\u201d in the scam, which resulted in his financial delinquencies. Id. at 15, \n16. Applicant argues that his situation is distinguishable from the cases involving real estate \nschemes, as he \u201cdeveloped a trusting, romantic relationship\u201d with SSG A that did not involve \n\u201ccreative financing\u201d or some other \u201cget rich quick\u201d scheme. Id. at 7. The Judge, however, clearly \narticulated the basis for his conclusion that the online scam was not a mitigating factor. He \nhighlights that\u2014by training and experience\u2014Applicant should have recognized that SSG A\u2019s \nstory was transparently false. Nevertheless, Applicant engaged in an online relationship for \napproximately two years and gave SSG A approximately $100,000 without ever meeting or talking \nto her, raising serious questions about his judgment. The Judge\u2019s determination that these \ncircumstances were not beyond Applicant\u2019s control and that Applicant did not act reasonably is \nwell-supported by the record. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the \nrequirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record \nin reaching his decision.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 29, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On September 29, 2023, after the hearing, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent consumer debts totaling approximately $67,200, two \nmortgage accounts that are alleged to be past due, and an unpaid civil judgment in the approximate \namount of $1,511,000. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the ten allegations, \nand the Judge found adversely to him on all allegations. On appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge \n\u201cfailed to instruct [Applicant] on the necessity of documentation to support mitigation factors\u201d and \nfailed to conduct a proper analysis of the mitigating conditions and whole person.

They \nhave no children. Applicant served in the military from approximately 1986 to 1993 and was \nhonorably discharged. Following military service, he completed an electrical apprenticeship \nprogram and, a few years later, started his own company with his stepfather. Their business was \nsuccessful for approximately 20 years\u2014until 2017\u2014at which time Applicant was forced to close \nthe company. The consumer debts arise primarily from Applicant\u2019s use of credit cards as he closed \nhis business and transitioned to new employment. The judgment of approximately $1.5 million \narises from a successful lawsuit brought by his stepfather alleging a breach of fiduciary duty in \ntheir partnership. \nAt hearing, Applicant denied any wrongdoing in how he handled his company\u2019s affairs and \nstated that he has no intent to pay the judgment to his stepfather. Regarding the seven alleged \nconsumer debts, Applicant confirmed that they remain outstanding. Regarding his delinquent \nmortgage accounts, however, Applicant testified that he had made payments and progress. For a \nmortgage account on his primary residence that was past due in the approximate amount of \n$30,600, Applicant testified that he is in compliance with a repayment agreement established in \nAugust 2022. Regarding the delinquent mortgage account on his second home with a balance of \napproximately $2,000, Applicant testified that he had completely paid the account; however, the \nJudge noted, \u201che has provided no documentary evidence to substantiate his testimony.\u201d Decision \nat 6. In fact, she noted, \u201cApplicant has submitted no documentary evidence at all.\u201d Id. \nOn appeal, Applicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nInstead, his Counsel raises what he characterizes as a due process concern. AB at 10. Throughout \nhis brief, Counsel repeatedly argues that Applicant \u2013 who was pro se at the hearing \u2013 did not \nunderstand his evidentiary burden prior to the hearing, that the Judge failed to explain it to him \nuntil the end of the hearing, and that she then \u201cchose to close the record at the end of the hearing . \n. . without ever informing [Applicant] that the record could remain open, an option open to all \napplicants.\u201d Id. at 7. For the reasons detailed below, we find this argument to be entirely without \nmerit. \nFirst, the record confirms that Applicant received a copy of both the Directive and the \nDOHA Hearing Office\u2019s prehearing guidance on May 24, 2023, a full three months prior to his \nhearing. The Directive places the burden for presenting evidence in mitigation squarely on the \napplicant: \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant . . . and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Counsel argues \nthat Applicant \u201cdid not know or understand how to prepare evidence for his case or the legal \nburdens that he would have to overcome.\u201d AB at 9. Even pro se applicants are expected to take \nreasonable steps in protecting their rights. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01997 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n14, 2022). Moreover, contrary to Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge \u201cfailed to instruct [Applicant] \non the necessity of documentation to support mitigation factors,\u201d a judge is not obligated to advise \nan applicant on how to exercise his rights or make his case in mitigation.

Because \nApplicant admitted to making no payments on his judgment or delinquent consumer debts, \nCounsel\u2019s argument pertains exclusively to Applicant\u2019s testimony that he had made payments on \nthe two delinquent mortgage accounts and had paid one mortgage off entirely. At the end of \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, the Judge inquired whether he had any documents with him at hearing that \nhe wanted to place into evidence. Applicant replied: \u201cNo. There\u2019s no documents.\u201d Tr. at 65. Later, \nthe Judge asked specifically whether Applicant had any documentation to support his testimony \nregarding either mortgage account, to which Applicant replied, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not on my Credit Report \nanymore.\u201d Id. at 68. Having been advised by Applicant that he had no corroborating documents, \nthe Judge closed the hearing shortly thereafter without offering to hold the record open. Given his \ntestimony that he had no documents, Applicant is ill-positioned now to argue that he was somehow \ndeprived of his right to submit documents. Applicant may be dissatisfied with the outcome of his \nhearing, but we find no reason to conclude that this outcome resulted from a deprivation of \nApplicant\u2019s due process rights or that Applicant did not have adequate notice of those rights.  \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence in conducting her mitigation and whole-person analyses. None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered \nall of the record evidence or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the requirements \nof the Directive in her whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record in reaching her \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons \n(SOR) pursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising \nApplicant that his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nof the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. On February 27, 2022, Applicant submitted a \nreply. \nOn November 7, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under \nthe provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and he elected that process. Hearing Exhibit 1D. On March \n6, 2023, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Mark \nHarvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-thirties and has served in the military since 2010. Married and \ndivorced twice, he has three children. His first wife is deceased, and their two children receive \n$800 per month in survivor benefits. His second wife has custody of all three children, and \nApplicant is current on his $1,000 per month child support obligations. \nApplicant and his second wife married in 2015 and accumulated debt while she was in \ngraduate school. After their separation in October 2018, Applicant could not afford the payments \non their debts, and multiple debts became delinquent. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR reflects eight delinquent accounts totaling about $53,200. In his February \n2021 subject interview, Applicant stated that he was not making payments on those debts on advice \nof counsel, in anticipation that some of them would be assigned to his wife in their pending divorce. \nIn the November 2021 divorce, all but one of the marital debts were assigned to Applicant. From \nFebruary 2021 to the present, Applicant made no payments to the SOR creditors. \nIn his February 2022 response to the SOR, Applicant said that he planned to resolve the \ndebts through bankruptcy, and he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 2022. Applicant \ndelayed filing for bankruptcy because he could not get clear answers on how filing would affect \nhis career and his security clearance. In February 2023, the bankruptcy court confirmed a payment \nplan that includes all of the alleged debts. His bankruptcy records indicate about $160,000 in debt, \nand his monthly payment to the trustee will be $3,000. \nIn August 2021, Applicant borrowed $9,000 from a non-SOR creditor, but stopped making \npayments in March 2022. A $10,000 debt to this creditor is included in his bankruptcy. Applicant \ndeployed to Iraq from October 2021 to May 2022 and saved about $8,000. Applicant has an \noutstanding service record, strong support from military officers, and numerous individual and \ncampaign awards. \nIn the past two years, Applicant did not make any payments on the eight delinquent debts \nalleged on the SOR. Although he borrowed $9,000 from a non-SOR creditor in August 2021 and \nsaved $8,000 during his recent deployment to Iraq, he failed to show how he used these funds to \naddress his SOR debt. \nBased on his track record of debt payments, I am not confident that Applicant will \nmake the required payments under his bankruptcy plan. He did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances, and he did not make a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis delinquent debts occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to \nbe resolved under his bankruptcy plan. His delinquent debts continue to \u201ccast doubt \non [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and ability to \nprotect classified information.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nKristin D. Figueroa-Contreras, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 9, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On November 15, 2023, Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana once in the spring of \n2020 after being granted access to classified information in March 2018. The SOR further alleged \nunder Guideline E that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the foregoing marijuana use, \nincluding her use while holding a security clearance, on her July 2022 security clearance \napplication (SCA). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the single use of marijuana in 2020, \nexplaining that it was a one-time, isolated occurrence. She denied intentionally omitting the \ninformation from the SCA and explained that she self-reported the use during her subsequent \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance interview in September 2022. The Judge found against Applicant on all \nallegations. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her early 30s. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013 and has been married \nsince 2017. Applicant was previously employed by a government contractor from 2017 to 2021 \nand was granted a Secret security clearance in 2018. In about the spring of 2020, while holding \nher clearance, she used marijuana on one occasion. At the time, Applicant resided in a state where \nmarijuana was legal under state law. \nIn February 2021, Applicant was hired by her current government contractor employer. In \nconjunction with her new position and requirement for a Top Secret security clearance, she \ncompleted a new SCA on July 29, 2022, wherein she disclosed no illegal drug use. When Applicant \nrealized she had incorrectly answered the drug-related questions, she discussed the matter with a \nfriend and decided she would correct her mistake during her upcoming security clearance \ninterview. On September 20, 2022, Applicant disclosed the omitted drug information to the \ninvestigator, explaining that she took \u201cabout two puffs\u201d from her husband\u2019s joint. She further \nexplained that she did not report her drug use to her employer because she was not aware that she \nwas required to do so, and she clarified that she had overlooked the drug questions on her 2022 \nSCA because the questionnaire populated answers from her previous SCA and she only briefly \nlooked over the updated SCA before submitting it. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that she never used marijuana or any other illegal drug \nbefore or after the single incident in 2020. She explained that she had consumed two alcoholic \nbeverages before her 2020 marijuana use, which she described as a minor lapse in judgment. \nApplicant was aware that marijuana use was illegal under Federal law and incompatible with \nholding a security clearance. She denied knowing that she was supposed to report any illegal drug \nuse to her employer while possessing a security clearance; however, she acknowledged receiving \nannual security briefings during which this topic was likely discussed. Applicant testified that she \nfailed to disclose the 2020 marijuana use on her 2022 SCA because it slipped her mind. She did \nnot immediately report her omission to her facility security officer (FSO) because, at the time, she \nwas not aware of one. Applicant also did not report her omissions to her program manager, despite \ntheir prior communications about Applicant needing to complete the new SCA. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use casts doubt on her suitability to hold \na clearance. The Judge further concluded that Applicant deliberately falsified her 2022 SCA. \nCiting Applicant\u2019s \u201ctestimony and other record statements replete with inconsistencies,\u201d the Judge \ndetermined that Applicant was not a credible, reliable, or trustworthy source, and that she failed to \nmitigate the Guideline H and Guideline E security concerns. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nA judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if it \u201cfails to examine relevant \nevidence, fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, \nfails to be based on a consideration of relevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere \ndifference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 94-0215 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor \nVehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). On appeal, Applicant \nargues that the Judge\u2019s treatment of the Guideline H and E mitigating conditions was not supported \nby the totality of the record evidence. We find this argument persuasive and, for the reasons stated \nbelow, reverse the Judge\u2019s adverse decision. \nGuideline H \nThe Judge found mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b) potentially applicable, but \nultimately held that neither fully applied. Applicant argues that the Judge failed to properly apply \nthe Guideline H mitigating conditions, noting that Applicant \u201ctook responsibility for her one-time \nmarijuana use, which consisted of nothing more than a puff of a joint over 3.5 years ago, in a state \nwhere recreational marijuana use was legal at the state level.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. Applicant\u2019s \nargument in this regard has merit. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) affords mitigation where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The Directive is silent \non what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation. That silence, however, does \nnot relieve a judge of the obligation to construe and apply pertinent provisions of the Directive in \na reasonable, common-sense way. See ISCR Case No. 02-08032, 2004 WL 1434394 at *5 (App. \nBd. May 14, 2004). The Board has repeatedly held that, if the record reflects a significant period \nof time has passed without misconduct by an applicant, then the judge must articulate a rational \nbasis for concluding why that time does not demonstrate changed circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. Id. \nHere, Applicant\u2019s only marijuana use occurred in mid-2020, more than two years before \nshe submitted her latest SCA and over three years prior to her security clearance hearing. \nMoreover, other than never having used the drug and thereby obviating a Guideline H discussion \nentirely, it would be impossible for Applicant\u2019s marijuana use to be any more infrequent than the \nsingle occurrence. Despite the foregoing, after finding AG \u00b6 26(a) potentially applicable, the Judge \nsummarily concluded that the condition was not fully applicable without providing any analysis. \nThe Judge\u2019s failure to articulate a sustainable rationale for discounting the mitigative effect of AG \n\u00b6 26(a) constitutes harmful error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09239, 2006 WL 4078449 at *3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nConsidering the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s Guideline H decision is \narbitrary and capricious because it fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the choice made and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. The Guideline H \ndecision is not sustainable. \nGuideline E \nFalsification of a security clearance application raises serious questions about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness and is clearly relevant to assessing an applicant\u2019s security \neligibility. See ISCR Case No. 03-06016, 2005 WL 1382029 at *3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2005). The \nmore complicated issues on appeal stem from the Guideline E case, including questions of whether \nthe falsification allegations were established and, if so, were they mitigated. \nIntentional Omissions \nThroughout her security clearance investigation and hearing, Applicant consistently denied \nthat she intentionally omitted her 2020 drug use from her 2022 SCA, and therefore the Government \nhad the burden of proving falsification. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Although it is clear that Applicant did \nnot disclose the drug use on her SCA, proof of an omission alone does not establish an applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind when the omission occurred. See ISCR Case No. 02-23133, 2004 WL \n2152744 at *4 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). See also ISCR Case No. 14-05005, 2017 WL 4476434 at \n*4, n.3 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017) (to establish a falsification, an applicant\u2019s answers must have \nbeen deliberately false, not simply untrue). Rather, a judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s \u201ctestimony and other record statements [were] replete \nwith inconsistencies\u201d and therefore concluded that she \u201cis not a credible, reliable, or trustworthy \nsource.\u201d Decision at 9. As a result of these perceived inconsistencies, the Judge largely discounted \nApplicant\u2019s case in mitigation under Guidelines E and H. On appeal, Applicant argues that \u201c[t]he \nstatements which [the Judge] perceived to be inconsistent were not truly inconsistencies, but rather \na conflation of [Applicant\u2019s] testimony with her witness.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. This argument is of \nmixed merit. \nBased on our review of the record and in particular the hearing transcript, we agree that \nsome of the purported inconsistencies more accurately reflect an unclear record than actual \ndiscrepancies. For example, the Judge found that \u201c[a]lthough [Applicant] admitted she had \nthoroughly reviewed the [SCA] online for accuracy and completeness,\u201d it was not until she \nsubmitted it and printed a hard copy that she realized she had incorrectly answered two of the \nillegal drug questions. Decision at 2. The first part of this finding is incorrect. Applicant testified \nthat it was after she submitted the SCA and later printed it that she reviewed her responses \nthoroughly and thereby discovered the inaccuracies. Tr. at 18-19. The incorrect finding is not \nobviously harmless because the idea that Applicant thoroughly reviewed her SCA, including the \nincorrect drug use responses, prior to submitting it suggests that she would have noticed an \ninaccuracy at that time were it unintentional. This is not, however, what the record reflects \noccurred. The Judge also found inconsistent that Applicant told the investigator she only briefly \nreviewed the 2022 SCA before submitting it, but later testified that she had taken a week to prepare \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe questionnaire. Decision at 4. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding, these facts are not necessarily \ninconsistent. It is possible, and indeed appears throughout the record, that Applicant spent about a \nweek completing her SCA (see, e.g., Tr. at 17, 44-45) and only briefly reviewed her responses \nonline before submitting it. See, e.g., Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 5; Tr. at 35. \nThe Judge also found inconsistent, however, Applicant\u2019s explanation for why she failed to \ndisclose her 2020 marijuana use on the 2022 SCA. Decision at 4, 7. Specifically, the Judge found \nthat Applicant explained during her interview that the \u201cinformation was omitted from the [SCA] \nbecause [she] overlooked the question\u201d and \u201cclarified that the information populated from her \nprevious investigation and that she briefly looked over the questionnaire prior to submitting it.\u201d \nGE 2 at 5. At hearing, Applicant testified that the one-time use \u201cslipped [her] mind\u201d because she \ndoes not use drugs and had not used them in the past. Tr. at 19-20, 35-36. She also testified, albeit \nwith some apparent confusion, that the drug use questions did not automatically populate on her \n2022 SCA and she had to specifically answer them (id. at 45-46), which she acknowledged doing \nin the negative. Id. at 17-18. \nBased largely on this perceived inconsistency, the Judge concluded that \u201cApplicant \ndeliberately falsified her July 2022 SCA by intentionally failing to disclose her 2020 use of \nmarijuana while holding a DOD security clearance.\u201d Decision at 8. Between her interview \nsummary and responses provided at hearing to questions from three different sources, Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation for her SCA omission is not a picture of clarity; however, Applicant bore the burden \nof persuasion as to mitigation and had multiple opportunities at hearing to clarify what she now \ncontends are misinterpretations of her own evidence. We therefore find \u2013 somewhat reluctantly \u2013 \nthat the Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the intentionality of Applicant having omitted her drug use \nfrom the SCA was reasonable, and we will not disturb that conclusion on appeal. \nPrompt, Good-Faith Effort to Correct Omission \nFollowing a conclusion that Applicant intentionally falsified her 2022 SCA, the question \nremains whether her subsequent disclosure during the security clearance interview was sufficient \nto mitigate the concern via application of AG \u00b6 17(a).1 Here, the Judge found that \u201cApplicant\u2019s \nfailure to immediately report her omissions to her FSO or program manager and deciding to wait \nuntil she was interviewed by a DOD authorized investigator does not demonstrate a prompt, good-\nfaith effort to correct her previous omissions.\u201d Decision at 8. This conclusion is problematic for \nseveral reasons. \nThe words \u201cprompt\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d are not defined in the Guidelines, and the Board has \ndeclined to establish a bright line definition of either term as they relate to Guideline E. See ISCR \nCase No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). We have, however, \ninterpreted \u201cprompt\u201d to mean acting within a reasonable time. Id. A reasonable time does not mean \n\u201cimmediate.\u201d \n1 AG \u00b6 17(a) \u2013 \u201cthe individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTurning to the second element of the mitigating condition, the concept of \u201cgood faith\u201d \nrequires a showing that a person acts in a way that reflects reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation. See ISCR Case No. 99-0201 at *3. Just as with the term \u201cprompt,\u201d \nwhat constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort will depend on the particular facts of the case. \nApplicants have a duty to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material \nquestions during a security clearance investigation. Directive \u00b6 6.2. It is preferable that applicants \nself-report any omission, falsification, or concealment of requested information through the \nappropriate channel sooner versus later. We are aware of no DoD rule, however, that imposes an \nobligation or duty on an applicant to self-disclose an SCA omission at a particular time or through \na particular channel outside of the investigation and adjudication processes. Absent evidence that \nan applicant had such a formal duty, his or her correction of the omission at the initial security \nclearance interview, done prior to being confronted with the information, should be afforded \nsignificant weight in mitigation. \nHere, Applicant submitted her SCA in July and participated in her interview in September, \nabout seven weeks later. GE 1; GE 2. With respect to why she failed to report her omission to \nanyone prior to the interview, her unrebutted testimony was that a program manager directed her \nvia email to complete a new SCA, that she was unaware of having an FSO, and that upon realizing \nthe error of her SCA, she was unsure of what to do and decided the best course of action was to \nreport the omission during her upcoming interview. Tr. at 21, 38-39, 47-48. As an initial matter, \nthere is no evidence to suggest that her program manager was an appropriate person to receive \ninformation concerning security incidents. Rather, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency advises contractor employees to self-report certain life events and security incidents to \ntheir FSO.2 Any negative inference drawn from Applicant\u2019s failure to report her omission sooner \nto her program manager is baseless. \nAdditionally, while Applicant could have reported the omission sooner to her FSO, she \nwas not obligated to and, again, appears to have been unaware of having such a resource. Simply \nput, there is no evidence that Applicant knew of an opportunity to correct her omission prior to her \ninterview. Considering the foregoing, the record does not support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \nApplicant should have corrected her omission prior to her interview. Applicant\u2019s decision to wait \nwhat was ultimately seven weeks to report the omission during her interview was not in conflict \nwith any known duty to self-report, was reasonable considering the circumstances, and amounts \nto a prompt, good-faith correction that should have been afforded mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a). \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious as it runs contrary to the \nweight of the record evidence. Based on the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s conduct is mitigated \ndue to the isolated and dated nature of her marijuana use and her prompt, good faith effort to \ncorrect omitting said use from her SCA. The adverse clearance decision is not sustainable. \n2 See, e.g., Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Report A Security Change, Concern, Or Threat, \nwww.dcsa.mil/mc/pv/mbi/self_reporting (last visited Feb. 15, 2024). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 15, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On August 8, 2023, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn October 12, 2023, the Appeal Board determined that the Judge erred in finding that \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after applying for a security clearance. The Board also found \nthe Judge\u2019s decision unclear as to what disqualifying conditions she applied and, in particular, \nwhether she applied AG \u00b6 25(f). We remanded the case for correction of the foregoing errors. On \nOctober 26, 2023, the Judge again denied Applicant\u2019s request for security clearance eligibility and \nApplicant appealed that decision.

Seeking to obtain an initial \nsecurity clearance, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2022, \nwherein he disclosed his history of illegal drug involvement. Based on those disclosures, the SOR \nalleged that Applicant used marijuana from 2015 to March 2022, cocaine from 2015 to 2021, \nhallucinogenic mushrooms from 2016 to 2021, and LSD in 2017. The SOR further alleged that \nApplicant sold marijuana in 2017, and that he purchased and used various prescription medications \nnot prescribed to him, including Adderall and Vyvanse from 2016 to 2018, Tramadol in 2017, \nVicodin in 2018, and Xanax in 2015. In response to the SOR, Applicant denied selling marijuana \nbut admitted the other allegations with explanation. \nThe Judge found that Applicant used the illegal and prescription drugs as alleged in the \nSOR. She noted that Applicant knew he was violating state and Federal laws when he used \nmarijuana, cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms, and that he continued to use marijuana \nfrom July 2021 through March 2022 while holding a sensitive position. Moreover, although he did \nnot receive any money for his participation, Applicant acted as a middleman in a transaction \ninvolving the sale of marijuana in 2017. The Judge further found that Applicant failed to \ndemonstrate a willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, and concluded that doubts \nremain about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for security clearance. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges two of the Judge\u2019s factual findings as unsupported by the \nrecord and argues that those errors impacted the Judge\u2019s analysis of the case. These arguments \nhave merit. \nRecommendation Letters \nApplicant first argues that the Judge improperly weighed his recommendation letters \nbecause she found that they did not reference his illegal drug use and therefore it appeared that the \nreferences did not know the specifics of the allegations against him. Appeal Brief at 15. The Judge \nacknowledged the favorable information expressed about Applicant in his various \nrecommendation letters, including his \u201cgood character, work ethic, and commitment to the \nprinciples of integrity and confidentiality.\u201d Decision at 3. The Judge noted that, per Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, he did not provide the SOR to any of the references, but only \u201cverbally discussed the \nallegations\u201d with them. Id. at 4; Tr. at 60-61. Applicant further testified that none of the letters \ncontain details about his alleged drug use because \u201cthe statement that I wanted them to use was \nthey were aware of the allegations for brevity in the letter.\u201d Tr. at 61-62. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge went on to find that only one of the letters \u201cmakes any reference to being aware \nof Applicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use, and characterizes it as occurring prior to his employment \nwith the company, which is not accurate.\u201d Id. at 3-4. On appeal, Applicant argues that \u201cthere is not \neven a scintilla of evidence to support this finding\u201d because the \u201cletters of recommendation do \nreference [Applicant\u2019s] drug use.\u201d Appeal Brief at 15. Applicant\u2019s argument, while somewhat \nhyperbolic, has merit as the Judge\u2019s finding is not technically correct. \nOf the six letters provided in support of Applicant, not one, but two reference \u2013 in very \ngeneral terms \u2013 an awareness that the SOR alleged concerns about drug use. See Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) I at 4 (\u201cAlthough he has had a history of drug use prior to starting work at [the company], I \nknow those days are fully behind him.\u201d) (emphasis added); id. at 5 (\u201cI would like to address the \nallegations of former drug use that have surfaced during [Applicant\u2019s] clearance process. I know \nthose days are fully behind him.\u201d). The other four letters reference, without any specificity, \n\u201callegations\u201d made against Applicant or challenges during his security clearance process. See AE \nE; AE I at 1-3. To the extent that the Judge did not consider in her decision the second letter that \nreferences Applicant\u2019s drug use, she should remedy that error on remand. \nSensitive Positions \nMore significantly, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he began working in a \n\u201csensitive position\u201d in July 2021 and argues that this erroneous finding is unsupported by any \nrecord evidence and was harmful as it afforded application of disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(f).1 \nThe Judge found that \u201c[i]n July 2021, Applicant began working for a defense contractor in \na sensitive position.\u201d Decision at 2. She then referenced this finding throughout her analysis. See \nid. at 6 (finding disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 26(f)2 applicable because \u201cfrom July 2021 through \nMarch 2022, Applicant continued to use marijuana . . . while holding a sensitive position\u201d); id. at \n6-7 (Applicant\u2019s \u201cextensive history of illegal drug use . . . coupled with his continued use of \nmarijuana after being hired by a defense contractor and while holding a sensitive position, support \na finding that he fails to show the requisite character and judgment required to meet the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified information.\u201d); id. at 7 (Applicant \u201ccompletely disregarded \nDoD policies\u201d when he \u201ccontinued to use marijuana after being hired by a defense contractor and \nwhile holding a sensitive position.\u201d). The Judge appears to equate Applicant beginning \nemployment with a defense contractor with his holding a sensitive position. This interpretation is \nincorrect and, contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding, the record is devoid of evidence that Applicant held \na sensitive position during the period in question. \nFor purposes of national security eligibility determinations, the Directive defines \u201csensitive \nposition\u201d as: \n1 In making this argument, Applicant relies on Executive Order No. 10,450 (see 18 Fed. Reg. 2489 (Apr. 27, 1953)); \nhowever, that Order was repealed in 2017 by Executive Order No. 13,764 (see 82 Fed. Reg. 8115 (Jan. 17, 2017)). \n2 AG \u00b6 25(f) provides disqualification for \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAny position within or in support of an agency in which the \noccupant could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, \na material adverse effect on the national security regardless of \nwhether the occupant has access to classified information, and \nregardless of whether the occupant is an employee, military service \nmember, or contractor. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 D.8. We have previously held that this broad language is \u201cdesigned to be inclusive and \nencompass a wide range of positions, including those that require eligibility for access to classified \ninformation (i.e., a security clearance).\u201d ISCR Case No. 22-01661 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2023). \nThe term \u201csensitive position\u201d is not so broad, however, to encompass any and all employment with \na defense contractor. \nTo the contrary, an individual cannot hold a national security position, to include a sensitive \nposition, until they are found eligible to do so, which either requires favorable completion of the \ninvestigative and adjudicative processes or, in exceptional circumstances, may be granted on a \ntemporary basis while the investigation is underway.3 It follows, then, that an individual cannot \nhold an initial sensitive position prior to commencing the associated background investigation. In \nthis case, Applicant\u2019s background investigation began with submission of his SCA in May 2022 \nand it was erroneous to find that he held a sensitive position prior to that date. The Judge\u2019s reliance \non this finding is inextricable from the rest of her disqualification analysis, and we are therefore \nunable to conclude that it was harmless error. \nIn light of the errors identified, above, the best resolution of this case is to remand it to the \nJudge to correct the errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive. Upon remand, \na judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no jurisdiction \nover a remanded decision. However, a judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may be appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nOn February 1, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons \n(SOR) pursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising \nApplicant that his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines in Appendix A \nof Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017 (AG). On May 9, 2022, Applicant \nsubmitted a reply. \nOn October 31, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under \nthe provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and he elected that process. On March 14, 2023, after close \nof the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. He contends that the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence \nand misapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Consistent with the following, we remand. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized and quoted in \npertinent part below. \nApplicant is in his late forties. He earned his high school equivalency in the 1990s and \nserved on active duty from 1996 through 2000 and in the Reserve force until 2004. Married since \n1996, Applicant has one daughter in her early twenties. His son died in 2013 at the age of 14. \nApplicant\u2019s wife also served in the military and retired in 2015. \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged the following alcohol-related incidents: a 1994 arrest \nfor Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) that resulted in conviction; a 1996 traffic stop in which \nApplicant\u2019s BAC was under the legal limit; a 1996 arrest for DWI that resulted in conviction; a \n2005 verbal altercation with his wife in military family housing that resulted in a guilty plea to \nPublic Intoxication; a 2008 verbal altercation with his wife in military family housing that resulted \nin Applicant\u2019s arrest for assault against a police officer and resisting a police officer but no \nconvictions; a 2014 arrest for DWI that resulted in conviction; and a May 2019 arrest for DWI that \nresulted in a suspended sentence of one year jail time, a fine, a class for repeat offenders, and two \nyears of community supervision, which ended in April 2023. In addition to these incidents, the \nSOR also alleged that Applicant attended a substance abuse course after his 2014 arrest for DWI \nand it alleged his history of alcohol consumption as related by him during his 2017 security \nclearance interview. Under Guideline J, all the alcohol-related incidents were cross-alleged, with \nthe exception of the 1996 traffic stop that did not result in conviction.  \nAlthough Applicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for about 18 months \nfollowing his 1994 DWI, he did not attend meetings or alcohol-related counseling from 1996 \nthrough 2014. After his 2014 DWI, Applicant attended a brief court-ordered counseling. He \ntestified that he was diagnosed as having an alcohol abuse disorder and cautioned to monitor his \nalcohol consumption, but that he was not told to abstain. Applicant did not attend any alcohol-\nrelated counseling between 2015 and 2020. \nIn February 2020, Applicant attended in-patient alcohol counseling for a \nweek at a recovery center. During this in-patient treatment, he was again diagnosed \nwith an alcohol use disorder and was advised to abstain from alcohol. After his in\u00ad\npatient counseling, he attended about four out-patient substance abuse and \nbehavioral counseling sessions until about June 2020. In March 2022, he began \nattending out-patient counseling sessions with a licensed substance abuse counselor \n(SA counselor). He initially attended these sessions once a week, but based on his \nprogress, he began attending them bi-weekly. His SA counselor notes that he is \nmaking progress with PTSD [Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder] and alcohol abuse. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nShe diagnosed him as having \u201calcohol abuse disorder-in remission\u201d and stated he \nis working on abstaining from alcohol consumption. [Decision at 5\u20136.] \nApplicant consumed two alcoholic beverages in the year prior to the hearing\u2014a shot of \nalcohol on his son\u2019s birthday in March 2022 and a glass of wine with Thanksgiving dinner in \nNovember 2022. In April 2022, his spouse acknowledged that Applicant had modified his alcohol \nconsumption. In May 2022, Applicant asserted that he would never drink and drive again, that he \nwould modify his alcohol consumption, and that if he drinks in the future, he will do so responsibly. \nAt the hearing, he stated that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t really drink anymore\u201d and that he decided to stop drinking \nafter November 2022 because he does not miss it. Id. at 6. Applicant acknowledged that, according \nto his understanding of the principles of AA, the two drinks in 2022 are considered relapses. Id. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below in pertinent part. \nGuideline G \nApplicant has four DWI convictions. He engaged in multiple verbal \naltercations with his spouse while he was drinking that involved the police or MPs.  \nOn one of those occasions, he had a physical altercation with police. He was \ndiagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. In 2020, while he was receiving inpatient \nalcohol counseling, he was told that he should abstain from alcohol consumption. \nAs evidenced by the two drinks he has consumed in 2022 and his spouse\u2019s March \n2022 statement that he drinks in a responsible manner, he has not followed that \ntreatment recommendation. [AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (d), (e), and (f)] are established.1 \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant had a pattern of alcohol-related incidents that lasted over 20 years. \nGiven the number of convictions for DWI and verbal or physical altercations where \nalcohol was involved, he has not shown that his behavior is infrequent or happened \nunder unusual circumstances. His last DWI occurred recently enough that he is still \non probation. Despite his many problems with alcohol, he consumed it as recently \nas November 2022. . . . AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply.2 \nWhile Applicant has taken steps to acknowledge and correct his problem \nwith alcohol, he consumed alcohol as recently as November 2022, well after it was \nrecommended that he abstain. He has not provided sufficient evidence of a clear \n1 AG \u00b6 22(a), alcohol-related incidents away from work; AG \u00b6 22(d), diagnosis of alcohol use disorder by duly \nqualified professional; AG \u00b6 22(e), the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and AG \u00b6 22(f), alcohol \nconsumption, which is not in accordance with treatment recommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n2 AG \u00b6 23(a), so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nand established pattern of abstinence. AG \u00b6 23(b) does not apply.3 \nApplicant provided evidence that he is participating in alcohol and \nbehavioral therapy and making satisfactory progress. However, in 2020, while \nattending inpatient counseling, he was told that he should abstain from alcohol. He \nhas not abstained from alcohol and therefore has a history of relapse. AG \u00b6 23(c) \ndoes not apply.4 \nApplicant provided evidence that he successfully completed an alcohol \ntreatment program in 2020. However, as he has not abstained from consuming \nalcohol, he has not demonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence in \naccordance with the treatment program\u2019s treatment recommendations. AG \u00b6 23(d) \ndoes not apply.5 [Decision at 8\u20139.] \nGuideline J \nApplicant had a pattern of DWI offenses that has extended for over 20 years. \nHe has been convicted of four DWIs. He is still on probation for his last DWI in \n2019. Despite a 2020 treatment recommendation that he should abstain from \nalcohol, he has not shown that he is able to do so for any extended period of time. \nGiven these considerations, I cannot find that he has shown that his criminal \nbehavior happened under unusual circumstances or that it is unlikely to recur. \n[Decision at 10.] \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0184 at 5, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, \n1998) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. \n29, 43 (1983)). \n3 AG \u00b6 23(b), the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of actions \ntaken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n4 AG \u00b6 23(c), the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no previous history of treatment \nand relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a treatment program. \n5 AG \u00b6 23(d), the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, the gravamen of Applicant\u2019s argument is that the Judge made improper findings \nregarding Applicant\u2019s failure to follow treatment recommendations and that he relied upon those \nimproper findings in applying the mitigating conditions, rendering his decision arbitrary and \ncapricious. We agree. The Judge\u2019s repeated adverse determinations regarding Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnoses, treatment recommendations, and failure to follow treatment recommendations raise two \nclosely-related issues. These matters were not alleged in the SOR, raising due-process concerns, \nand the Judge failed to explain a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions given the ambiguous \nstate of the evidence. \nThe SOR does not allege either a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder or a failure to follow \ntreatment recommendations. Instead, the SOR under Guideline G alleges Applicant\u2019s numerous \nalcohol-related incidents, his drinking history as reported by him to the background investigator, \nand the fact that Applicant attended a substance abuse class following his 2014 DWI. \nIn arriving at his findings regarding diagnoses, treatment recommendations, and \nApplicant\u2019s purported failure to follow those recommendations, the Judge appears to rely on the \nfollowing testimony elicited during Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Applicant: \nDC: And what were your takeaways from that three-day course [in April \n2015 following conviction for the 2014 DWI]? Did . . . anyone sit down with you \nand examine your record of alcohol abuse and come to a recommendation for you? \nAPP: To the best of my knowledge, I believe so. I want to say that they \nfound that I was alcohol abusive, and . . . basically told me to watch the amount of \nalcohol I consumed. \nDC: So . . . what they identified you as is alcohol abusive? Was that a \nprognosis (sic) of alcohol abuse disorder? \nAPP: I don\u2019t know. \n[Tr. at 79.] \n. \n. \n. \nDC: [Regarding Applicant\u2019s 2020 inpatient treatment] Do you recall if there \nwas a diagnosis of what your issues may be [when you checked in]? \nAPP: Well, they don\u2019t really diagnose you at the beginning because they \ndon\u2019t . . . know enough about you. At conclusion, that was when they diagnosed \nme with post-traumatic stress as well as alcohol abuse. \nDC: So they confirmed the alcohol abuse disorder that was first diagnosed \nformally when you were in treatment in April of 2015. Is that correct? \nAPP: Yes. \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDC: And when you left there at the end of your seven-day stay, what was \ntheir recommendation and professional advice to you with regard to future \ndrinking? \nAPP: Pretty much to abstain. \nDC: Okay. \nAPP: Well, I believe that\u2019s correct. I\u2019m not a hundred percent on that. I\u2019d \nhave to look at the paperwork they issued to . . . be exactly sure. [Id. at 87\u201388.] \nApplicant also testified that his current SA counselor has not recommended abstinence, \nthat he reported his two drinks in 2022 to her, and that she cautioned him to \u201cbe careful with \ndrinking anything.\u201d Id. at 91\u201392. The SA counselor submitted a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf in \nwhich she referenced his current diagnoses of Alcohol Use Disorder in Remission and PTSD and \ncited his \u201csignificant progress.\u201d AE K.  \nThe Judge appears to have concluded that Applicant\u2019s testimony alone established AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n22(d), (e), and (f)\u2014i.e., that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in 2015 and 2020, \nthat he failed to follow treatment advice once diagnosed, and that he consumed alcohol in violation \nof treatment recommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Decision at 7\u20138. In \nrendering his unfavorable clearance decision, the Judge relied heavily on his conclusion that \nApplicant drank alcohol in violation of treatment recommendations, citing that fact as dispositive \nin his analysis of three of the four mitigating conditions under Guideline G and again as a factor \nin his analysis under Guideline J. Id. at 9, 10. \nWe note that it was Applicant who introduced the subject of his 2020 inpatient treatment \nin his SOR response. Although a failure to follow treatment recommendations was not alleged in \nthe SOR, it was not necessarily improper for the Judge to have considered a failure to adhere to \nthe treatment recommendations from that program, insofar as non-alleged conduct can be relevant \non, inter alia, issues of mitigation, rehabilitation, and the whole-person analysis. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). However, our review of the decision and of the \nrecord as a whole persuades us that the Judge did not consider this evidence in its proper context. \nCf. ISCR Case No. 17-01193 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2019). \nFirst, the Judge erred in that he failed to explain how he reached his conclusion that \nApplicant was advised to abstain from alcohol and that he consumed it in violation of that \nrecommendation, given the equivocal nature of Applicant\u2019s testimony, the lack of any medical \nrecords or evaluations substantiating that recommendation, and the current counselor\u2019s diagnosis \nof alcohol use disorder in remission. The Judge did not recognize and resolve the obvious \nambiguities, but instead simply stated his finding in a conclusory manner. Second, the Judge erred \nin that he did not consider the purported failure to follow treatment recommendations for limited \npurposes, as permitted, but instead repeatedly cited Applicant\u2019s failure to abstain as the \ndeterminative factor in his analysis.

Jun. 17, 2016). Based on our review of the \nJudge\u2019s decision, we conclude that his heavy reliance on AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and (f)\u2014Applicant\u2019s \nnoncompliance with purported treatment recommendations\u2014violated Applicant\u2019s due process \nrights under the Directive. In the absence of an amendment to the SOR, an Administrative Judge \ncannot find against an applicant based on a matter not encompassed by the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 99-0500 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2000). \nConclusion \nThe errors identified above warrant a remand. Directive \u00b6 4.3 provides that an unfavorable \nclearance decision shall not be made without first providing an applicant with notice of the specific \nreasons for the proposed action and an opportunity to respond to those reasons. In this case, the \nSOR alleged that Applicant attended alcohol treatment. This consisted of a DWI education course \nfollowing his first DWI conviction in 1995 and a group education class following his third DWI \nconviction in 2015. The SOR makes no reference to Applicant being diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder, a failure to follow advice once diagnosed, or alcohol consumption not in with \naccordance treatment recommendations. The Judge applied disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), \n(e), and (f), when there are no SOR allegations that fairly raise those security concerns. A fair \nreading of the Judge\u2019s decision shows that it is based significantly on unalleged conduct and \ncircumstances. Such a due process violation is not harmless error. Although the Judge did not \nexplicitly make a credibility determination regarding Applicant, his findings implicitly call \nApplicant\u2019s credibility into question. This would cause a reasonable person to question the \nimpartiality of the Judge on remand. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-03974 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2006). Given these circumstances, we conclude that the best resolution is to remand this case to a \ndifferent judge for a new hearing. Under Directive E3.1.35, the Judge assigned the case is required \nto issue a new clearance decision. The Board retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision. \nHowever, the Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

The Majority Opinion identifies no harmful error, and \nits chosen remedy serves no valid juridical purpose. I respectfully dissent. \nRemand is Unnecessary \nAs an initial matter, I disagree that remand is appropriate in this case. The majority \nconcludes that the Judge\u2019s handling of the Guideline G concern was arbitrary and capricious for \ntwo reasons. First, they find that he failed to satisfactorily explain his conclusions regarding \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis and failure to follow treatment recommendations \u201cgiven the ambiguous state \nof the evidence.\u201d Majority Opinion at 5. The majority also fault the Judge\u2019s analysis of these two \nthings under the disqualifying conditions because the \u201cSOR does not allege either a diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder or a failure to follow treatment recommendations.\u201d Id. \nI agree that it would have been preferable for the Judge to explain how he reconciled \nambiguities in the record regarding Applicant\u2019s diagnosis and treatment recommendations. I do \nnot agree, however, that either his failure to do so or his application of disqualifying conditions \n22(d), (e), and (f) constitutes harmful error. \nAnalysis of Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations Not Error \nThe majority finds that Applicant was denied due process because the Judge analyzed \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis and failure to follow treatment recommendations under the Guideline G \ndisqualifying conditions, even though the SOR alleged neither concern explicitly. \nGenerally, a judge is \u201cprecluded from raising security concerns outside the scope of the \nSOR . . . and conduct not alleged or otherwise fairly embraced by the SOR\u201d may only be \nconsidered for limited purposes, including evaluating an applicant\u2019s credibility, rehabilitation, or \ncase in mitigation. ISCR Case No. 14-03475 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). \nThe purpose of an SOR is to put an applicant on notice of the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns and to enable him to present his case for mitigation. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 4, 2014). It is an administrative pleading and should not be held to the \u201cstrict requirements \nof a criminal indictment.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0430 at 6 n.3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2001). Variances \nbetween an SOR allegation and a judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are expected, and they are \nmaterial only when so great that the SOR fails to provide an applicant with reasonable notice of \nthe concerns against him, thereby subjecting him to unfair surprise at hearing. See ISCR Case No. \n12-01266 at 3. As long as an applicant receives reasonable notice about the matters at issue in his \ncase and has a meaningful opportunity to respond, a security clearance case should be decided on \nthe merits of the relevant issues and should not be overly concerned with pleading niceties. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001). \nApplicant\u2019s February 2020 alcohol treatment, which was initiated in response to his 2019 \narrest for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), was fairly embraced by the SOR\u2019s Guideline G \nallegations concerning the 2019 DWI and Applicant\u2019s 25-year history of other alcohol-related \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nincidents. Applicant himself appears to have understood that the 2020 treatment was encompassed \nby the SOR as he alerted the Government to this information in his SOR response. See SOR \nResponse at 5-6, 8, 12. Applicant also raised the subject of his 2020 alcohol treatment first at \nhearing, during his direct examination. See Tr. at 60-61. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s 2020 alcohol \ntreatment and all that flowed from it cannot plausibly have caused him unfair surprise. \nMoreover, even though the subject matter was not formally added to the SOR, Applicant \nrequested and was granted an opportunity to specifically obtain and present treatment records, \nwhich certainly could have included \u201cthe paperwork they issued to [him],\u201d as referenced during \nquestioning about the treating provider\u2019s recommendations. See Tr. at 9, 63-64, 87-88; SOR \nResponse at 8, 19. Therefore, the purpose of a notice requirement \u2013 to afford an individual an \nopportunity to prepare and respond \u2013 was satisfied in this case, and Applicant suffered no \nprejudice. \nThe majority insists that any conduct not explicitly alleged in the SOR may be used for \nonly limited purposes, even if the conduct fell under the same adjudicative concern and even if the \napplicant had a meaningful opportunity to address the conduct prior to the close of the record. This \nstrict position is difficult to reconcile with prior pronouncements that an SOR, an administrative \npleading, should not be held to the same rigid standards as a criminal indictment or overly \nconcerned with pleading niceties. Exploration of the evolution of this policy would require more \nin-depth analysis, to include examining whether a judge is precluded from considering only new \nadjudicative concerns (i.e., Guidelines) or from considering any conduct not explicitly alleged \nunder those concerns, and what conduct is \u201cfairly embraced\u201d or \u201cencompassed\u201d by, but not \nexplicitly stated in an SOR. This is ultimately unnecessary at this time, however, because the \nJudge\u2019s decision in this matter is sustainable on other grounds. \nDenial is Sustainable on Other Grounds \nRemand in this case is also unnecessary because the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse decision was \nbased on other, sustainable grounds beyond the Guideline G analysis with which the majority takes \nissue, rendering that purported error harmless. \nAn error is harmless, and remand is therefore inappropriate, \u201cwhen a clearance denial is \nbased on multiple security concerns, some of which are sustainable and not affected by the error.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007).6 Here, the SOR cross-alleged the following \nsummarized concerns under Guidelines G and J, all of which the Judge found adversely: Applicant \nwas charged with DWI in 1994, 1996, 2014, and 2019; he remained on probation for the 2019 \nDWI at the time of the hearing; military police responded to Applicant\u2019s residence in 2005 due to \nreports of domestic dispute and observed him to have a strong odor of alcohol; and military police \n6 See also, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-11181 at 2 (App. Bd.

If remand were warranted, \nthe matter should be returned to the original Judge to correct the purported errors. \nThe majority concludes sua sponte that reassignment is necessary because, \u201c[a]lthough the \nJudge did not explicitly make a credibility determination regarding Applicant, his findings \nimplicitly call Applicant\u2019s credibility into question.\u201d Majority Opinion at 7. In reaching this \nconclusion, the majority points to no specific portion of the Judge\u2019s decision, but it appears they \nare relying on the Judge\u2019s discussion reconciling conflicting evidence of the events precipitating \nthe 2019 DWI, as presented in Applicant\u2019s version and the police report. Decision at 5.7 \nReassignment of a case on remand is appropriate only when the lower court judge\u2019s \nconduct is \u201cso extreme as to display clear inability to render fair judgment\u2019\u201d Liteky v. United States, \n510 U.S. 540, 551 (1994). It should be exercised only in extraordinary cases. Cobell v. \nKempthorne, 455 F.3d 317, 331 (D.C. Cir. 2006). A judge\u2019s opinions about the facts of a case do \nnot raise concerns about bias or partiality \u201cunless they display a deep-seated favoritism or \nantagonism that would make fair judgment impossible\u201d and \u201cjudicial rulings alone almost never \nconstitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.\u201d Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555. \nA practice has evolved that sometimes8 \u2013 but not always9 \u2013 the Board will reassign a case \non remand if the original judge rendered something amounting to a credibility determination. This \n7 The Judge made the following findings: \n\u201cThe result of the blood test was that [Applicant] had a .141% BAC. Applicant claimed that he was \nnot intoxicated when he drove to the crash scene. He claimed that, as he was hot, he drank two 12\u00ad\nounce beers between about 10:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. while waiting for the police to complete their \ncrash investigation. . . . He claimed that he was not intoxicated until after he had the two beers late \nthat morning, but also acknowledged that he must have been intoxicated before that, but he did not \n\u2018feel it.\u2019 The police report does not reference him drinking these two beers and it reflects that his \nspouse did not believe he drank these two beers. \nApplicant was over the legal limit of .08 BAC. I find it highly unlikely that the two beers he drank \nover two hours before his blood draw cause his BAC to go over the legal limit of .08 BAC. Instead, \nI find that he was driving while intoxicated when he drove to the accident scene that morning.\u201d \nDecision at 5 (internal citations omitted). \n8 See, e.g., ADP Case No. 20-02075 at 7 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nOn February 1, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons \n(SOR) pursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising \nApplicant that his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in \nAppendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017). \nOn October 31, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under \nthe provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). As a result of Secretary \nMoultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive the process set forth in the \nDirective, and he elected that process. On March 14, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn his initial appeal, Applicant contended that the Judge failed to properly consider all \navailable evidence and misapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. On May 31, 2023, the Appeal Board determined that the \nrecord raised due process concerns and remanded the decision for assignment to a different judge \nand for a new hearing. On July 14, 2023, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran again denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for security clearance eligibility and Applicant appealed that decision. \nNow on his second appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all \navailable evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and \nfailed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person analysis. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in his late forties, served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1996 through \nhis honorable discharge in 2000, and served for the next four years in the Reserve force. He married \nhis wife during his military service, but they recently separated. They have one adult daughter and \nlost their son to suicide in 2013. Applicant has been a civilian employee of the military since 2016. \nUnder Guidelines G and J, the SOR alleged concerns arising from the following conduct. \nIn 1994, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) after consuming between two \nand eight drinks. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 180 days of probation, and subsequently \nattended Alcoholics Anonymous for a period and abstained from alcohol for over a year. \nIn March 1996, Applicant was arrested for suspicion of DWI after consuming about three \ndrinks; however, his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was below the legal limit and he was not \ncharged. Later that same year, Applicant was arrested for DWI after drinking and driving following \na Fourth of July barbeque. He informed his command about the July 1996 arrest and believed the \nmilitary coordinated his punishment with the state. Applicant later learned this was incorrect and \nrealized in about 2003 that he had an outstanding warrant. He pled nolo contendere to the DWI \ncharge and was sentenced to three days in jail and 90 days\u2019 suspended license. \nOn Thanksgiving 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife contacted military police (MP) and reported a \nverbal altercation with Applicant over his having pointed a rifle at his head in front of their seven\u00ad\nyear-old son the prior week. The son reported that Applicant asked him if he would like to see \nApplicant blow his brains out, then retrieved a rifle from the closet, loaded it, and pointed it at \nApplicant\u2019s own head. The MPs noted a strong odor of alcohol coming from Applicant, who \ncorroborated his son\u2019s story. Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct, to which he later pled \nguilty. At his security clearance hearing, he denied loading or pointing the shotgun at his head. \nIn December 2008, Applicant\u2019s wife again contacted the MPs to report a domestic \ndisturbance after she overheard Applicant express that he was going to end her career and she \nresponded by locking herself and the children in a bedroom. Applicant became angry and beat on \nthe door, causing minor damage. The MPs reported that Applicant appeared to be extremely \nintoxicated. He refused to comply with their directions, pushed one officer, resisted apprehension, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand was subsequently pepper-sprayed, which made him more aggressive and combative. Applicant \nwas transported to the hospital for treatment and issued citations for battery on a peace officer, \nresisting arrest, and assault against a peace officer, which were later dismissed. At his security \nclearance hearing, Applicant denied becoming physical during the incident, and asserted that the \nMPs tackled, kicked, and beat him without provocation. He believes the charges were dismissed \nbecause of the injuries he sustained from the MPs. \nIn November 2014, Applicant was again arrested for DWI (BAC .15%) and open container. \nHe pled guilty to the former charge and was sentenced to twelve months of probation and \ncompletion of an alcohol assessment and treatment, which he attended for five days in April 2015 \nand consisted of group education about drinking and driving. \nOn a morning in May 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife crashed her car into a fence after swerving to \navoid hitting a deer. She walked a few miles home to inform Applicant, who had been drinking \nthe night before. Applicant drove his truck with his wife to the scene of the accident, stating that \nhe planned to repair the fence to prevent any livestock from entering the road. He also stated that \nhe packed some beer in a cooler to drink while he repaired the fence. Deputies were already at the \nscene when Applicant and his wife returned, and state highway patrol officers arrived later. An \nofficer reported a strong odor of alcohol from Applicant, who informed the officer that he had \nabout nine or ten beers the night before. Applicant initially participated in a field sobriety test, but \nstopped partway through, and later refused breathalyzer and blood tests. He was arrested and \ntransported to a hospital, where his blood was drawn pursuant to a warrant and his BAC was \n.141%. Applicant was charged with DWI (3rd or more), a felony. In April 2021, he pled nolo \ncontendere to DWI (2nd), a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to two years of probation. He later \ntestified that he accepted the plea because security personnel informed him that a felony conviction \nwould affect his security clearance, while a misdemeanor conviction likely would not. \nAt his security clearance hearing, Applicant expressed that he waited at the scene of the \naccident for about two and a half hours and passed the time by drinking two of the beers he brought. \nApplicant later moved his truck at the request of law enforcement and, when he walked back to \nthe scene, the officer requested to conduct a field sobriety test. Applicant believed that the request \nto move his truck was a set-up so the investigator could have evidence of Applicant driving, and \nhe refused to consent to any of the procedures until the court ordered a blood test. Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s recollection, the police report stated neither that Applicant drank at the scene nor that \nhe moved his truck. Regarding this conflicting evidence, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s account \nwas not credible, and that the police report was the more accurate description of what occurred. \nApplicant received inpatient alcohol treatment for seven days in February 2020 and had \nreceived outpatient treatment since April 2022. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and alcohol use disorder, in remission. Applicant drank a shot in March 2022 for his late \nson\u2019s birthday and a glass of wine in November 2022 for Thanksgiving but has otherwise abstained \nfrom alcohol since 2020. Applicant testified that he is committed to remaining sober and his \ntherapist reported that Applicant has made significant progress in his treatment goals related to his \ngrieving process and alcohol abuse. Applicant submitted numerous documents attesting to his \nexcellent job performance and strong moral character, and the Judge noted that Applicant is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cpraised for his trustworthiness, dependability, work ethic, leadership, professionalism, expertise, \ndedication, and loyalty to the United States.\u201d Decision at 8. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]our DWI convictions are not to be taken lightly, and \n[did] not accept [Applicant\u2019s] versions of some of the incidents.\u201d Id. at 10. While \u201cApplicant may \nsomeday reach the point where he can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns, . . . it will \ntake full acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, complete candor, and a longer period without \nmisconduct.\u201d Id. The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s alcohol use and criminal conduct continue \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, and the mitigating conditions, \neither individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns. Id. at 10, 11. \nDiscussion \nOn his second appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in failing to comply with \nthe provisions in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all the evidence, by \napplying facts that were not supported by the record evidence, and by not properly applying the \nmitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. \nChallenge to Findings of Fact \nApplicant first asserts that \u201cseveral of the Administrative Judge\u2019s factual findings are \nwholly unsupported by the record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. As we have explained before, there is a \ndifference between errors in a judge\u2019s findings of fact and errors in the conclusions drawn \ntherefrom. See ISCR Case No. 22-00822 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2023). Findings of fact must be \nsupported by substantial evidence, while conclusions are reasonable inferences drawn from the \nevidence. See ISCR Case No. 18-00496 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019), citing Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.1 \nand E3.1.32.3. Applicant\u2019s purported factual errors are simply challenges to the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence and are therefore addressed along with his other arguments. \nChallenge to Judge\u2019s Credibility Determination \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence regarding the 2019 \nDWI arrest, namely the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant\u2019s account of the incident was not \ncredible and that the police report was the more accurate description of what occurred. Appeal \nBrief at 10-12.1 As set forth below, Applicant\u2019s challenge is unpersuasive. \nApplicant first argues that \u201cin deciding to resolve the apparent conflict in favor of the police \nreport, the Administrative Judge does not address a statement signed by [Applicant] four days after \nthe incident which is exactly the same as [Applicant\u2019s] testimony at two administrative hearings.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 11.2 Applicant\u2019s focus on this statement as the basis for any assignment of error is \n1 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 provides that \u201cthe Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d With respect to this conflicting evidence, we note that the Judge on remand, without having \nreviewed the original decision, reached the same unfavorable conclusion about the credibility of Applicant\u2019s account \nof the 2019 incident. \n2 In support of this statement, Applicant points to a statement entered into the record as Government Exhibit (GE) 9; \nhowever, the statement actually appears at GE 10. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nmisplaced for several reasons, not the least of which is that there is a rebuttable presumption that \nthe Judge considered all of the record evidence, and that presumption is not rebutted merely \nbecause the appealing party can point to information in the record that was not mentioned in the \nJudge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09781 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2002). \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s counsel asserts that this statement was \u201csigned by [Applicant] \nfour days after the incident.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. We interpret counsel\u2019s inclusion of this assertion \nas an attempt to show that the close temporal proximity between the event and the statement lends \nto the latter\u2019s credibility; however, counsel\u2019s assertion is inaccurate. The incident occurred on the \nmorning of May 11, 2019, and Applicant signed the referenced statement on May 15, 2020 \u2013 one \nyear and four days after the incident. GE 10 at 4-5. It bears noting that, from our examination of \nthis evidence, Applicant did not self-report his 2019 arrest to his security officer. Rather, the 2019 \narrest was identified in March 2020 as part of the Continuous Evaluation Program, following \nwhich DoD issued Applicant a Request for Further Information (RFI)3 in April 2020, and he \nthereafter responded with the referenced statement. GE 6; GE 10 at 5. The timing and involuntary \nnature of Applicant\u2019s disclosure weigh against his overall candor about the incident. \nApplicant\u2019s claim that his statement is \u201cexactly the same\u201d as his testimony across two \nadministrative hearings is also inaccurate. In the statement, Applicant details the events of the \nmorning, beginning when his wife arrived home, through his arrest. Applicant asserted in the \nstatement that he \u201chad brought a couple of beers with [him] to drink while [he] worked on the \nfence\u201d and \u201cdrank two beers while we waited for the investigator.\u201d GE 10 at 4. Applicant went on \nto explain his interaction with the police wherein, after complying with an officer\u2019s instruction to \nmove his truck, the officer requested that Applicant perform a field sobriety test. In response to \nthe officer saying that he smelled alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath, Applicant asserted that he \u201chad \ndrank two sixteen ounce beers on the side of the road while waiting for him and to fix the fence.\u201d \nId. The foregoing information indeed mirrors Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony; however, and quite \nnotably, nowhere in the statement did Applicant acknowledge having had anything else to drink \nprior to arriving at the scene. That significant detail was omitted from Applicant\u2019s very first \nreporting of the incident to DoD, which further weighs against his candor. \nIt is well-established that \u201c[d]etermining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the \nspecial province of the trier of fact.\u201d Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 \n(1982). In addition to the evidence discussed above that reflects on Applicant\u2019s candor, the record \ncontains numerous conflicts between Applicant\u2019s account and other evidence. For example, \ncontrary to Applicant\u2019s explanation that he drank two beers at the accident scene, the reporting \nofficer noted that no open containers were found during an inventory of the vehicle. GE 8 at 3. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s wife reported that she saw him with his last drink, which he left at their \nhouse and did not bring with him in the car before returning to the scene, and which was still on \nthe table when she returned home. Applicant\u2019s wife also reported that she checked the vehicle \nherself and found no open containers. Id. When conflicts exist within the record, a judge must \nweigh the evidence and resolve conflicts \u201cbased upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the \ncomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of evidence.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). Here, the Judge\u2019s resolution of conflicts \n3 The RFI was issued \u201cto aid in the determination of [Applicant\u2019s] eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d GE \n10 at 6. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbetween Applicant\u2019s account and the police report was reasonable and sustainable. We find no \nreason not to give deference to the Judge\u2019s negative credibility determination regarding Applicant. \nChallenge to Application of Mitigating Conditions and Whole-Person Analysis \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal is that the Judge failed to duly consider \nand give adequate weight to his favorable evidence in terms of possible mitigation and application \nof the Whole-Person Concept. For example, Applicant repeatedly challenges the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that he has yet to accept responsibility and accountability for his conduct. See Appeal \nBrief at 3, 10, 12, 14, 15 (referring to Decision at 10). Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s finding \nthat AG 23 \u00b6\u00b6 (a) and (b) did not apply was in error and relied on \u201cthe improper finding that \n[Applicant] failed to accept responsibility for his actions.\u201d Appeal Brief at 14. He asserts that the \nrecord reflected, and the Judge ignored, \u201csignificant evidence that [Applicant] has made significant \nlifestyle changes since the 2019 incident which is indicative that [he] has acknowledged a change \nwas necessary.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). \nApplicant also argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to give any consideration in his analysis to \nfavorable evidence offered by [Applicant] through testimony and exhibits and instead substituted \nhis own impression of [Applicant] contrary to favorable record evidence.\u201d Appeal Brief at 14. The \ndecision reflects that the Judge considered the evidence favorable to Applicant, including his \nefforts to remain sober; his therapist\u2019s report of treatment progress and characterization of the two \ndrinks in 2022 being \u201clapses,\u201d not \u201crelapses;\u201d and his honorable military service and his favorable \ncharacter evidence. Decision at 10, 12. When weighed against a lengthy and significant history of \nalcohol-involved personal and criminal incidents, however, the Judge had \u201clingering concerns \nabout [Applicant\u2019s] drinking and the extremely poor judgment he exhibited while drinking,\u201d and \nultimately concluded that the record left questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Id. Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s application of \nmitigating and whole-person factors amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence supports that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nNicholas T. Temple, Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nOn August 1, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline \nI (Psychological Conditions) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix \nA of Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017. \nOn November 15, 2022, the DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, and Applicant appealed that revocation \nunder the provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense \n(Intelligence & Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or \nmilitary personnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, \nand the date of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal \nprocess set forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and he elected that process.

Loughran \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. The Government appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, the Government contends that the Judge failed to properly consider all available \nevidence, misapplied the Guideline G mitigating conditions, and misapplied Guideline I \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a), rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Consistent with the following, we remand the decision to address errors in the \nJudge\u2019s Guideline I analysis. Other issues raised by the Government are not ripe for discussion at \nthis time. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nThe Judge\u2019s findings and analysis are summarized and quoted in pertinent part below. \nApplicant is in his early thirties and is a non-commissioned officer in the military. He has \nserved since 2011. He had a series of mental health, disciplinary, and criminal incidents, some of \nwhich involved alcohol. In 2014, he had a \u201cpanic attack\u201d and stabbed himself repeatedly in the \nthigh with a pen and was treated in an emergency room. In 2017, 2019, and 2021, Applicant was \ninvolved in alcohol-related incidents for which he was directed to attend military-sponsored \nalcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs. \nA DoD psychologist evaluated Applicant in March 2022. She reported that Applicant had \nremained sober since July 2021. The psychologist concluded that Applicant did \u201cnot meet criteria \nfor any current mental health disorders but has a history of mental health diagnoses including \nadjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression\u201d dating back to 2014 or earlier. \nDecision at 3. Although the psychologist did not diagnose Applicant with an alcohol use disorder, \nshe noted that he met the criteria for mild alcohol use disorder in 2017, that ranged to severe in \n2019 and 2021. His past repeated alcohol use issues along with emotional and self-harming \nbehaviors are evidence of a material deficit in judgment, reliability, and stability. She said that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cminimization of alcohol use and the severity of alcohol related incidents and his \navoidance of discussing self-harm behaviors until asked . . . indicate a material defect in \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Id. at 4. \nUnder Guideline I, the Judge analyzed potentially disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), \n(b), (c), and (d). In particular, he found disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a) applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cpanic attack\u201d in 2014 and stabbing himself in the thigh with a pen; however, he found \nthe remaining alcohol-related conduct was covered under Guideline G and, \u201cby definition, cannot \nbe \u2018behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, \nnot covered under any other guideline.\u2019\u201d Id. at 10 (emphasis in original). The Judge also found \nthat Applicant\u2019s suicidal ideations, with no actual attempts, are not contemplated by AG \u00b6 28(a) \nbecause \u201c[t]houghts are not behavior.\u201d Id. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge noted that \u201cApplicant has mental-health issues in addition to his alcohol abuse \ndisorder,\u201d but ultimately held that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (d), and (e) were \u201cpartially \nor completely applicable and sufficient to alleviate any psychological conditions security \nconcerns.\u201d Id. at 12. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, we consider the Government\u2019s contention that the Judge erred by not applying \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a) to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct and suicidal ideations. \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the decision \nto determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0184 at 5, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle \nMfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nApplicant\u2019s psychological concerns long predate his alcohol consumption concerns. He \nbegan having suicidal ideations in approximately 2007 and last had such thoughts as recently as \nSeptember 2021. Tr. at 31-33. In 2014, with no apparent alcohol consumption, Applicant \nexperienced a \u201cpanic attack\u201d after receiving a Letter of Reprimand issued for smoking during \ntraining and repeatedly stabbed himself in the thigh with a pen, requiring emergency room \ntreatment. Decision at 2; Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 2. In 2019, after consuming an unknown \namount alcohol, Applicant had an incident wherein he, feeling dissatisfied with his personal \nprogress in his career and life, became aggressive, broke a table, punched a wall, head-butted a \nsteel structure, and made suicidal comments. Decision at 2; GE 3 at 2; Tr. at 23-24. In 2021, after \nreportedly consuming two beers, Applicant\u2019s military superior realized that Applicant was under \nthe influence and indicated that he was going to take the rest of Applicant\u2019s alcohol away. Tr. at \n41-42. When the two arrived at Applicant\u2019s residence, Applicant responded by smashing the \nalcohol bottles, slamming his head into the wall, punching the wall, and repeatedly stating that his \n\u201clife was over.\u201d Decision at 3; GE 2 at 1. At hearing, the Judge appeared to acknowledge that this \nlatest incident, which occurred after Applicant purportedly consumed only two beers, presented \nmore of a mental health concern than an alcohol consumption concern: \nJUDGE: Do you think that was an alcohol-related incident or a \nmental health incident, because clearly something went wrong? \n. . . \nAPPLICANT: Your Honor, the [military] quantifies any related \nincident that a member has consumed alcohol as an alcohol-related \nincident. So, in the eyes of the [military], it was an alcohol-related \nincident. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJUDGE: I\u2019m asking in your eyes. Do you think it was caused by \nyour drinking, or by your mental health issues? Or both? Because if \nit wasn\u2019t drinking, then something\u2019s wrong. Right? Because it \nwasn\u2019t normal behavior for somebody who\u2019s not drinking. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. Excuse me. Yes, Your Honor. Alcohol at the \ntime brought out negative feelings that I had internally, that I had \nunresolved trauma that I had not worked through, and the meeting I \nhad with my supervisor at the time . . . triggered an emotional \nresponse, as I felt that he was shaming me for something that I \nthought had been accepted by those around me in my leadership \nchain structure, Your Honor. [Tr. at 42-43.] \nIn March 2022, a Government-approved psychologist opined that Applicant\u2019s \u201cemotional \nlability and self-harming behavior in particular demonstrates problems with stability and \njudgment.\u201d GE 3 at 2. The psychologist noted that Applicant has previously been diagnosed with \nadjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression, but did \u201cnot appear to meet \ncriteria for any current mental health disorders.\u201d GE 3 at 1. Still, the psychologist determined that \nApplicant\u2019s prognosis is guarded and concluded that, \u201c[w]hile alcohol contributes to [Applicant\u2019s] \npoor decision-making, he also has demonstrated self-harm with no indications of alcohol use,\u201d \nand that \u201c[t]here is a high possibility that outside of treatment, [Applicant] could decompensate \nsignificantly.\u201d GE 3 at 3 (emphasis added). Aside from medications to address anxiety and \ninsomnia, which are prescribed by his general practitioner, Applicant does not participate in mental \nhealth treatment. Tr. at 53-54. \nDespite the foregoing and as a result of his interpretation of disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 \n28(a), the Judge\u2019s analysis focused primarily on the alcohol-related elements of Applicant\u2019s \nconduct without fully addressing the significance of Applicant\u2019s mental health history. AG \u00b6 28(a) \ncontemplates disqualification for \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, \nself-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or \nbizarre behaviors.\u201d For the following reasons, the Judge\u2019s failure to analyze Applicant\u2019s 2019 and \n2021 incidents and suicidal ideations under AG \u00b6 28(a) was in error.1 \n1 In arguing that the Judge erred by failing to apply AG \u00b6 28(a), the Government contends that this condition is a \n\u201ccatch-all\u201d provision for Guideline I and should be construed similarly to AG \u00b6 16(d), the Guideline E catch-all \nprovision. Appeal Brief at 15. We decline to adopt this interpretation. The language of these two disqualifying \nconditions is not only tailored to their specific Guideline but is also linguistically distinct \u2013 AG \u00b6 28(a) considers \nbehavior \u201cnot covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality disorder,\u201d \nwhile AG \u00b6 16(d) considers information \u201cnot explicitly covered under any other guideline.\u201d (Emphasis added). \nMoreover, the language of AG \u00b6 16(d) is inclusive in nature and provides a basis to allege information that \u201cmay not \nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination.\u201d As discussed further herein, the language of AG \u00b6 28(a) is \ndesigned to exclude allegations of conduct, which are otherwise fully addressed elsewhere in the Guidelines, and \nprevent unnecessary duplication. \nThe Government also argues that if AG \u00b6 28(a) was \u201climited to conduct that could not be alleged under any other \nguideline, it would effectively cease to exist.\u201d Appeal Brief at 17.

This narrow interpretation \nis problematic. \nThe Judge\u2019s interpretation of AG \u00b6 28(a) effectively prohibits the condition\u2019s application \nwhen an element of certain conduct can be analyzed under another Guideline, in this case \nGuideline G. There are certainly some types of conduct that fall squarely under Guideline G \nanalysis, such as plain Driving Under the Influence. But other types of conduct are multifaceted \nand not fully covered under other Guidelines, such as when an individual consumes alcohol and \nalso exhibits \u201cviolent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, \ndeceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors.\u201d \nTo highlight its potential impact, the Judge\u2019s narrow interpretation of AG \u00b6 28(a) would \nbar application of the disqualifying condition to the following incidents simply because the \nindividual had consumed alcohol beforehand: self-mutilating; attempting suicide; seeing \napparitions; running in the streets and entering the homes of strangers without permission; having \na reciprocated conversation with an inanimate object. To withhold application of AG \u00b6 28(a) to \nsuch multifaceted behaviors simply because there was an alcohol component (or some other \nelement covered by another Guideline) could result in a judge overlooking significant \npsychological concerns. Such an interpretation and related potential result would undermine the \neffectiveness of the industrial security program in protecting the national security, which the Board \nwill not abide. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-24356 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 26, 2003) (citation \nomitted). See also DISCR Case No. 87-2107 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 1990) (In construing the \nDirective, the Board will give \u201cbroad and liberal construction in order to effectuate [its] essential \npurpose vis-\u00e0-vis protecting and safeguarding classified information.\u201d). \nTo be \u201ccovered\u201d by another Guideline, the security concerns arising from the behavior at \nissue must be fully addressed by that other Guideline. If not, then psychological security concerns \nmay go unexamined when Guideline I is not applied to that behavior, which would undermine the \neffectiveness of the industrial security program.  \nHere, Applicant\u2019s violent, self-harming, and bizarre behaviors during the 2019 and 2021 \nincidents raised security concerns about his mental stability that go beyond the concerns arising \nfrom his alcohol consumption. In her evaluation, the psychologist also raised concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s mental stability based on his mental health history. An analysis of Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior during the 2019 and 2021 incidents solely under Guideline G did not \u201ccover\u201d the \nGuideline I mental stability security concerns arising from those incidents. Those mental stability \nsecurity concerns should not go unaddressed. Based on the facts of this case, we conclude the \nJudge erred in not applying AG \u00b6 28(a) to Applicant\u2019s 2019 and 2021 incidents. \napplication of AG \u00b6 28(a) to the 2014 incident, and by our analysis of AG \u00b6 28(a) herein, this argument is without \nmerit. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to Apply AG \u00b6 28(a) to Suicidal Ideations \nThe Judge also held that Applicant\u2019s history of suicidal ideations is not disqualifying under \nAG \u00b6 28(a) because \u201cthoughts are not behaviors.\u201d Decision at 10. Without making a ruling directly \nregarding this statement, we note it is potentially problematic. Such a restrictive reading would \nrender a host of thoughts \u2013 such as homicidal ideations, delusions (hearing voices to turn over \nclassified information to a foreign adversary), bizarre beliefs (thinking one can control the weather \nwith his mind), etc. \u2013 immune from Guideline I disqualification. The potential to overlook security \nconcerns of that nature simply because they are thoughts undercuts such a narrow interpretation of \nAG \u00b6 28(a). \nHere, Applicant experienced suicidal ideations for about 14 years and also repeatedly \nengaged in self-harming behavior, which, when viewed in totality, elevated his ideations beyond \nmere \u201cthoughts.\u201d The Judge\u2019s decision to withhold application of AG \u00b6 28(a) to Applicant\u2019s history \nof recurrent suicidal ideations simply because \u201cthoughts are not behaviors\u201d resulted in him \noverlooking behaviors of potential significant psychological concern and was in error. \nConclusion \nThe Government has demonstrated error that warrants remand. Pursuant to Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.33.2, the Board remands the case to the Judge with instruction to issue a new decision, \nconsistent with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35, after correction of the errors identified, \nabove, and reconsideration of the record as a whole. \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s finding are summarized and quoted below. In his early thirties, Applicant is single and has served in the military since 2011. He has a history of mental health, disciplinary, and criminal incidents, primarily alcohol related. After his mother\u2019s death in 2007, Applicant began having suicidal ideations. In 2014, after receiving a letter of reprimand for smoking during training, Applicant had a \u201cpanic attack\u201d in which he stabbed himself repeatedly in the thigh with a pen, requiring treatment at the emergency room. In 2017, Applicant was drinking when he had an argument with his girlfriend, and base security responded to a noise complaint. He was not arrested, but his command directed him to attend an alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment program (ADAPT), in which he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, mild. While enrolled in the program, he drank on one occasion a few hours after his ADAPT appointment and was treated at the hospital for alcohol consumption. He successfully completed the program in 2018 and remained abstinent from alcohol for about ten months. In 2019, Applicant was drinking and broke a table, punched a wall, and head-butted a steel structure.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nNicholas T. Temple, Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nOn August 1, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline \nI (Psychological Conditions) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix \nA of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017). \nOn November 15, 2022, the DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, and Applicant appealed that revocation \nunder the provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense \n(Intelligence & Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or \nmilitary personnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, \nand the date of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal \nprocess set forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). As a result of \nSecretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive the process set forth \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin the Directive, and he elected that process. On June 13, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance. The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn its initial appeal, the Government contended that the Judge failed to properly consider \nall available evidence, misapplied the Guideline G mitigating conditions, and misapplied \nGuideline I disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a), rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. On August 31, 2023, the Appeal Board determined that the Judge \nerred in his failure to apply AG \u00b6 28(a) to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct and suicidal \nideations and remanded the case for correction of those errors. On September 14, 2023, Judge \nLoughran again granted Applicant\u2019s request for security clearance eligibility, and the Government \nappealed that decision. \nNow on its second appeal, the Government asserts that the Judge failed to properly apply \nGuideline I disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(b) and that his mitigation analysis under both \nGuidelines G and I and under the Whole-Person Concept failed to properly consider all available \nevidence. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s finding are summarized and quoted below. \nIn his early thirties, Applicant is single and has served in the military since 2011. He has a \nhistory of mental health, disciplinary, and criminal incidents, primarily alcohol related. After his \nmother\u2019s death in 2007, Applicant began having suicidal ideations. In 2014, after receiving a letter \nof reprimand for smoking during training, Applicant had a \u201cpanic attack\u201d in which he stabbed \nhimself repeatedly in the thigh with a pen, requiring treatment at the emergency room. \nIn 2017, Applicant was drinking when he had an argument with his girlfriend, and base \nsecurity responded to a noise complaint. He was not arrested, but his command directed him to \nattend an alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment program (ADAPT), in which he was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, mild. While enrolled in the program, he drank on one \noccasion a few hours after his ADAPT appointment and was treated at the hospital for alcohol \nconsumption. He successfully completed the program in 2018 and remained abstinent from alcohol \nfor about ten months. \nIn 2019, Applicant was drinking and broke a table, punched a wall, and head-butted a steel \nstructure. After security personnel responded, he expressed suicidal ideations and was taken to the \nhospital and held overnight. No criminal charges or nonjudicial punishment resulted, but Applicant \nreceived a letter of admonition and was directed to return to ADAPT. While in ADAPT, Applicant \nwas diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe, and his treatment recommendations included \nabstinence. \nApplicant remained sober from completion of ADAPT until 2021 when he reported to \nSaudi Arabia. Although alcohol is banned in Saudi Arabia, Applicant started drinking again to fit \nin. Over coffee, a senior enlisted member realized that Applicant was intoxicated, and the two \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreturned to Applicant\u2019s apartment to retrieve the alcohol. Upon arrival, Applicant smashed all the \nbottles, slammed his head into the wall, and punched the wall, injuring his hand. As a result of the \nincident, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice, to include suspended forfeitures and a suspended reduction in rank. \nApplicant again attended ADAPT from 2021 to 2022, and he received inpatient treatment \nfor about 29 days. Applicant successfully completed ADAPT, at which he was again diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder, severe, with a recommendation that he abstain from alcohol. \nIn March 2022, while still in ADAPT, Applicant was evaluated at DoD\u2019s request by a \npsychologist, who concluded: \u201c[Applicant] does not appear to meet criteria for any current mental \nhealth disorders but has a history of mental health diagnoses including adjustment disorder, \ngeneralized anxiety disorder, and depression dating back as early as 2014 and which the service \nmember indicated could have begun as early as 2012.\u201d Decision at 3, quoting Government Exhibit \n(GE) 3 at 3. Although the psychologist did not diagnose Applicant with alcohol use disorder, she \nnoted that he met the criteria for alcohol use disorder, mild, in 2017, and alcohol use disorder, \nsevere, in 2019 and 2021. Concerning Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption, the psychologist \nconcluded: \nBased upon [Applicant\u2019s] repeated alcohol use resulting in alcohol related incidents \neven after fully completing ADAPT twice, his pattern of emotional lability, self-\nharming behaviors in response to perceived criticism both with and without the use \nof alcohol, and his continued tendency to blame others, at least in part, for his \ndistress and alcohol use suggest there is evidence of a material deficit in judgment, \nreliability, and stability. [Applicant\u2019s] minimization of alcohol use and the severity \nof alcohol related incidents and his avoidance of discussing self-harming behaviors \nuntil asked by this provider indicate a material defect in trustworthiness. [Id. at 4, \nquoting GE 3 at 3.] \nApplicant did not start drinking alcohol until he was 21, but \u201cit eventually took control of \nhim.\u201d Id. at 4. Following the incident in Saudi Arabia in July 2021, Applicant began participating \nin Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and acknowledged his alcoholism. He remained sober from July \n2021 until May 2022, when he had one beer. He realized that the beer was a mistake, contacted \nhis sponsor, and has not had a drink since. Applicant credits AA for his continued sobriety. He \ntalks to his sponsor daily and attends meetings three to four times a week. \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his character. A lieutenant colonel who knows \nApplicant through AA wrote: \nDuring this period, I regularly maintain in-person and telephonic contact with \n[Applicant] to discuss sobriety issues through [AA]. I am providing this statement \nto attest to [Applicant\u2019s] character as I observed it during our time participating in \nAA meetings and meeting with him roughly every month for lunch at [military \nbase] to further discuss sobriety related issues. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nI have many years of experience as a member of AA and [Applicant] has taken our \nProgram seriously and he diligently follows our recommendations. He regularly \nattends meetings, maintains his accountability, and he is now running his own AA \nMeetings as a part of his service. [Id. at 4\u20135, quoting Applicant Exhibit (AE) C.] \nApplicant submitted numerous other letters attesting to his \u201cexcellent performance of \nduties and strong moral character,\u201d from people who are familiar with his history, believe him to \nbe rehabilitated, and recommend him for a security clearance. Id at 5. Included in the letters is one \nfrom the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) at Applicant\u2019s command, who is aware of Applicant\u2019s history \nas he advised the commander on the nonjudicial punishment. The SJA spoke to Applicant\u2019s \n\u201ccommitment to his continued sobriety\u201d and his \u201cprofessionalism, work ethic, drive, and \nrehabilitation\u201d before concluding that Applicant \u201cearned his second chance and has done \nadmirably.\u201d Id. at 5, quoting AE B. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nDisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 are established by Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \nincidents in 2017, 2019, and 2021; his diagnoses of alcohol use disorder, mild, in 2017 and alcohol \nuse disorder, severe, in 2019 and 2021; and his consumption of alcohol after recommendations of \nabstinence in 2019 and 2021. \nThe Judge concluded, however, that the alcohol consumption security concerns were \nmitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b).1 \nApplicant is an admitted alcoholic who went through the ADAPT program \nthree times, but still drank afterwards. Everything does not always work on the first \ntry, and this is particularly true with alcoholics. He was sober from July 2021 until \nMay 27, 2022, when he had one beer. He realized it was a mistake, contacted his \nsponsor, and has not had a drink since. \nApplicant credits AA for his continued sobriety, and he treats that as his \ntherapy. He has a sponsor that he talks to daily, and he attends meetings three to \nfour times a week. He plans on remaining sober one day at a time for the rest of this \nlife. He is proud of his military service and hopes to continue to serve until he can \nretire. He realizes that a return to drinking can jeopardize that opportunity. \n1 AG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; AG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption \nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation. I nonetheless believe \nthat he warrants another chance. I considered the length of his sobriety, and I also \nconsidered the strong support of those at his command. I found the character letters, \nand particularly the letters of the SJA and the lieutenant colonel who attends AA \nwith Applicant, to be helpful. I find that Applicant established a pattern of \nabstinence, and alcohol consumption no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. [Id. at 9.] \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe Judge found that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a)2 is applicable to Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cpanic attack\u201d in 2014, during which he stabbed himself in the thigh with a pen, and to Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of suicidal ideations and self-harming behavior, including in 2019 and 2021. The Judge \nalso determined that Applicant\u2019s past diagnosis of major depressive disorder established a \ndisqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 28(b),3 but he declined to apply AG \u00b6 28(b) to prior diagnoses \nof generalized anxiety disorder and adjustment disorder. Additionally, the Judge declined to \nconsider the DoD psychologist\u2019s opinion regarding Applicant\u2019s judgment and stability as rising to \na condition within the meaning of AG \u00b6 28(b). \nThe Judge noted that Applicant\u2014in addition to his alcohol abuse disorder\u2014has mental \nhealth issues that include suicidal ideations for about 14 years and repeated self-harming behavior. \nHowever, the Judge highlighted, the DoD psychologist found that Applicant does not meet the \ncriteria for any current mental health disorders, his credible testimony that he is doing better is \nsupported by numerous character letters, and there have been no additional incidents \u201csince \nApplicant got a grip on his alcohol problem in July 2021.\u201d Id. at 12. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s mental health conditions are under control and have a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; that he no longer shows indication of emotional \ninstability; and that there is no indication of a current problem. He determined that mitigating \nconditions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (d), and (e)4 \u201care partially or completely applicable and sufficient to \n2 AG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not \ncovered under any other guideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors. \n3 AG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition that may \nimpair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \n4 AG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan; AG \u00b6 29(d): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental \nhealth professional employed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s previous \ncondition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; AG \u00b6 29(e): there \nis no indication of a current problem. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalleviate any psychological conditions security concerns.\u201d Id. \nDiscussion \nThere is no presumption of error below. The appealing party has the burden of raising and \nestablishing that the Judge committed factual or legal error that is prejudicial. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo.19-01689 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2020). In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions \nare erroneous, we will review the decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant \nevidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it \nreflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an \nexplanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it \ncannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jul. 14, 1998).  \nOn appeal, Department Counsel raise four issues: that the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis under \nGuideline G was arbitrary and capricious as it failed to address Applicant\u2019s history of treatment \nand relapse; that his mitigation analysis under Guideline I was arbitrary and capricious as it ran \ncontrary to the weight of the evidence; that his whole person analysis was arbitrary, capricious, \nand contrary to law; and that he \u201cerred as a matter of law in failing to apply [AG \u00b6 28(b)] to \nApplicant\u2019s adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and materially-defective judgment \nand stability.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 12. We find none of Department Counsel\u2019s arguments \npersuasive. \nFailure to Apply AG \u00b6 28(b) \nWe turn first to Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge erred as a matter of law in \ndeclining to find that Applicant\u2019s adjustment disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were \n\u201cconditions\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6 28(b), which requires \u201can opinion by a duly qualified \nmental health professional that the individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d Department Counsel\u2019s arguments on this issue are perplexing at \nbest. \nFirst, the plain language of AG \u00b6 28(b) requires an opinion by a duly qualified mental \nhealth professional that an applicant has such a condition. Although the DoD psychologist noted \n\u201ca history of mental health diagnoses including adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety, and \ndepression dating back as early as 2014,\u201d GE 3 at 1, the psychologist does not provide any of the \nfollowing fundamental details: the identity of the mental health professional who rendered the \ndiagnoses; the qualifications of the mental health professional; the dates of any such diagnoses; \nand whether she gleaned this diagnostic history from medical records or from Applicant himself. \nMost importantly, the DoD psychologist herself found in March 2022 that Applicant \u201cdoes not \nappear to meet criteria for any current mental health disorder[.]\u201d Id. Put simply, the record does \nnot establish the bare minimum requirements of AG \u00b6 28(b) for generalized anxiety disorder and \nadjustment disorder\u2014an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nhas either disorder. In advocating for application of AG \u00b6 28(b), Department Counsel fail to \nacknowledge or address these fundamental deficiencies in the Government\u2019s position.5 \nSecond, Department Counsel\u2019s argument regarding psychological diagnoses of security \nconcern runs contrary to controlling policy established by the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI). Department Counsel argue at length (AB at 17\u201322) that the Judge erred when he held that \ngeneralized anxiety disorder and adjustment disorder do not present a per se security concern and \nthat he would not apply AG \u00b6 28(b) to those diagnoses without a particularized showing \u201cas to \nhow the condition may impair the individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Decision at 10. Advocating the contrary position, Department Counsel argue that \n\u201ctheir symptomology is such that each presents a Guideline I concern per se.\u201d AB at 18. After a \ndiscourse on the \u201csymptomology\u201d of each disorder as described in the DSM-5, Department \nCounsel unilaterally conclude that both disorders are of security concern per se because the \n\u201cdifferential diagnoses\u201d are so serious. Id. at 19\u201320. As an example, Department Counsel argues: \n\u201cNo reasonable factfinder could opine that \u2018bipolar and psychotic disorders\u2019 are unlikely to impair \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, which often \nresembles those disorders, should be treated the same.\u201d Id. at 20. \nThis sweeping and surprising argument is inconsistent with current Federal policy. There \nis an established list of the seven psychological diagnoses that raise security concerns per se. \nContrary to Department Counsel\u2019s argument, neither generalized anxiety disorder nor adjustment \ndisorder is on that list. In November 2016, DNI issued a memorandum revising the mental health \nquestions in Section 21 of Standard Form 86, the security clearance application (SCA). See DNI \nMemorandum on Revisions to the Psychological and Emotional Health Questions on the Standard \nForm 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, dated November 16, 2016. See also ISCR \nCase No 20-01838 at 6, n. 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2022). As revised, the SCA lists the psychological \ndisorders that are considered by their very nature to raise security concerns: Psychotic Disorder, \nSchizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Bipolar Mood Disorder, Borderline \nPersonality Disorder, and Antisocial Personality Disorder. The Judge plainly did not err in his \ndecision that AG \u00b6 28(b) is inapplicable to generalized anxiety disorder and adjustment disorder \nwithout further elaboration from a psychologist. Department Counsel fail to acknowledge or \naddress the fact that they are urging the Appeal Board to adopt a position contrary to current \nFederal policy regarding psychological diagnoses. \nPutting aside the diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder and adjustment disorder, we \nturn next to Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge erred in declining to apply AG \u00b6 28(b) \nto the DoD psychologist\u2019s opinion in her concluding paragraph that \u201cthere is evidence of a material \ndeficit in judgment, reliability, and stability\u201d and \u201ca material defect in trustworthiness.\u201d GE 3 at 3. \nAlthough the DoD psychologist concluded that Applicant does not meet the criteria for any current \nmental health disorders, Department Counsel nevertheless argue that her opinion about his \njudgment and stability rises to the level of a \u201ccondition\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6 28(b).

The \nJudge, however, made explicit findings on this issue, and there is nothing in his decision to suggest \nthat he conflated \u201cpsychological conditions\u201d with \u201cpsychological disorders.\u201d The Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that the psychologist\u2019s opinion fell short of a \u201ccondition\u201d is firmly grounded in the \npsychologist\u2019s own report, in which she specifically finds no current mental disorders and instead \nin her concluding paragraph provides a general opinion as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and \ntrustworthiness based on his history. Department Counsel\u2019s attempts to convert this opinion on \njudgment and trustworthiness into a psychological condition within the meaning of AG \u00b6 28(b) are \noverreaching and provide no reason for us to disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion to the contrary. \nIn summary, Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge erred as a matter of law in \nfailing to apply AG \u00b6 28(b) to Applicant\u2019s adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and \npurported \u201cmaterially defective judgment\u201d is without merit. \nArbitrary and Capricious Mitigation and Whole-Person Analyses \nDepartment Counsel argue that the Judge\u2019s mitigation analyses under Guideline I and \nGuideline G do not consider important aspects of the record and that his whole person analysis is \nsimilarly arbitrary and capricious. Here again, we do not find Department Counsel\u2019s arguments \npersuasive. \nRegarding Guideline I, Department Counsel argues that the Judge failed to articulate a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made in mitigation and that he arguably \nrendered a decision so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. AB \nat 23\u201324. To the extent that we understand Department Counsel\u2019s argument in this section, they \nappear to be again combing through the DSM-5 to assess the severity and amenability to treatment \nof various disorders that were not established under AG \u00b6 28(b) and arguing attenuated issues that \nwere neither alleged in the SOR nor inquired into at hearing (e.g., Applicant\u2019s failure \u201cto establish \nwhether his present pharmaceutical regimen is a viable long-term solution for his treatable \nconditions.\u201d AB at 24). The Judge entered robust findings on the Guideline I issues and thoroughly \ndetailed his reasoning and analysis. Department Counsel\u2019s arguments generally amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. A party\u2019s ability to argue for an \nalternative interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate error. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nRegarding Guideline G, Department Counsel argues that the Judge erred in his mitigation \nanalysis in that he failed to adequately address Applicant\u2019s history of treatment and relapse. \nSpecifically, Department Counsel argues that the Judge failed \u201cto explain convincingly why \nApplicant\u2019s latest period of abstinence\u201d is different from his prior periods of abstinence that ended \nin relapse.

The Majority focuses much of its discussion on what \nit considers to be several unsupported arguments made by the Government. In doing so, however, \nit overlooks legitimate errors in the Judge\u2019s analysis and the very serious and insurmountable \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s security clearance worthiness. For the following reasons, I respectfully \ndissent. \nGuideline G Analysis \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents in 2017, 2019, and 2021, his diagnoses \nof mild alcohol use disorder in 2017 and severe alcohol use disorder in 2019 and 2021, and his \ndisregard of recommendations to abstain from alcohol following his multiple ADAPT enrollments, \nthe Judge found five of the seven Guideline G disqualifying conditions applicable. He concluded, \nhowever, that concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption were mitigated through \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) due to Applicant\u2019s most recent length of sobriety, his \nparticipation in AA, and favorable character evidence provided by his command. On appeal, the \nGovernment contends that the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis failed to adequately address Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of alcohol treatment and relapse. \nThe extent to which security concerns are mitigated through the passage of time is a \nquestion that must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18\u00ad\n01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2019). Here, the record reflects the following: during and after his \n2017 enrollment in ADAPT, Applicant abstained from alcohol for about ten months before \nrelapsing (Tr. at 38); while participating in ADAPT a second time in 2019, Applicant failed to \ncomply with his plan for abstinence when he drank a few hours after an ADAPT appointment and \nwas hospitalized for alcohol consumption (GE 3 at 2-3); Applicant was advised to abstain from \nalcohol following his 2019 ADAPT enrollment and remained sober for nearly two years before \nrelapsing (Tr. at 39-40); Applicant was again advised to abstain from alcohol following his third \nADAPT enrollment in 2021 and remained sober for about one year before having a drink in May \n2022 (Tr. at 48). As of his June 2023 hearing, Applicant was sober for about 13 months. \nThe Judge did not address Applicant\u2019s prior periods of sobriety and multiple relapses in his \nanalysis other than to comment that \u201c[e]verything does not always work on the first try, and this \nis particularly true with alcoholics.\u201d Decision at 9. This analysis was deficient considering the \nrecord as a whole and, in particular, that Applicant is well beyond his \u201cfirst\u201d try. The Judge\u2019s \nfailure to convincingly explain why Applicant\u2019s current period of sobriety is long enough or \notherwise demonstrates a clear and established pattern of abstinence in light of his multiple prior \n\u2013 and sometimes lengthier \u2013 unsuccessful periods of sobriety was in error. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-01926 at 4; ISCR Case No. 18-02526 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2019). \n\u201cThe Board must consider not only whether there is evidence supporting a Judge\u2019s findings, \nbut also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting \nthose findings.\u201d ISCR Case No. 97-0727 at 3 (App. Bd.

Still, she opined that, \nBased upon [Applicant\u2019s] repeated alcohol use resulting in alcohol \nrelated incidents even after fully completing ADAPT twice, his \npattern of emotional lability, self-harming behaviors in response to \nperceived criticism both with and without the use of alcohol, and his \ncontinued tendency to blame others, at least in part, for his distress \nand alcohol use suggest there is evidence of a material deficit in \njudgement, reliability, and stability.

Due to Applicant\u2019s \u201creported lack of gaining any significant benefit from therapy and his \ncontinued tendency to blame others for distress, these potential material defects remain constant.\u201d \nId. at 2 (emphasis added). Despite the foregoing, the Judge found AG \u00b6 28(b) inapplicable to the \npsychologist\u2019s opinion, noting \u201cI do not find that the opinion by the psychologist that Applicant \nhas poor judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness equates to an opinion by the \npsychologist that he has \u2018a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness,\u2019 as many people have poor judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness, \n7 Applicant began attending AA in September 2021.

The Government argues that the Judge\u2019s failure to \napply AG \u00b6 28(b) to the psychologist\u2019s opinion was in error. \nIn his AG \u00b6 28(b) analysis, the Judge appears to equate the term \u201ccondition\u201d with \n\u201cdiagnosis.\u201d The Majority follows suit. This narrow interpretation is contrary to the plain language \nof the Directive, which distinguishes between diagnoses and conditions throughout the Guidelines \nand makes clear that a \u201cformal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for there to be a concern \nunder [Guideline I].\u201d See AG \u00b6 27. Where the Directive contemplates the necessity of a diagnosis \nfor a disqualifying condition to apply, it states so explicitly. Indeed, a diagnosis is specifically \nrequired under multiple disqualifying conditions throughout the Directive, including elsewhere in \nGuideline I.8 Conversely, AG \u00b6 28(b) requires \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional that the individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Exclusion of the word \u201cdiagnosis\u201d from AG \u00b6 28(b) is \ninstructive that \u201ccondition\u201d is not intended to be synonymous with \u201cdiagnosis,\u201d and instead \ncontemplates something broader. \nThe word \u201ccondition\u201d is defined as a \u201cstate of being\u201d or, more specifically, \u201ca usually \ndefective state of health.\u201d9 Under its plain language, AG \u00b6 28(b) does not require a diagnosed \ncondition, but rather contemplates an applicant\u2019s state of psychological health. When a qualified \nmental health professional opines that an applicant\u2019s current state is such that his judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness may be impaired, that is sufficient to invoke AG \u00b6 28(b), \neven absent a formal diagnosis.10 \nHere, the DoD psychologist affirmatively opined that Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol use \nissues, pattern of emotional lability and self-harming behaviors, tendency to blame others for his \ndistress and alcohol use, minimization of his alcohol use and the severity of related incidents, and \navoidance of discussing his self-harming behaviors all evidence material deficits or defects in \njudgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness. GE 3 at 3. This opinion was sufficient to \ninvoke application of AG \u00b6 28(b), and the Judge erred in declining that analysis. \nFailure to Fully Consider Psychologist\u2019s Opinion \nThe Government also argues that it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to reject the \npsychologist\u2019s adverse opinion as a security concern under Guideline I because, in doing so, he \n8 See AG \u00b6 22(d) (\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional . . . of alcohol use disorder\u201d); \nAG \u00b6 22(f) (\u201calcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment recommendations, after a diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder\u201d); AG \u00b6 25(d) (\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional . . . of \nsubstance use disorder\u201d); AG \u00b6 28(d) (\u201cfailure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness\u201d). \n9 Condition, MERRIAM-WEBSTER\u2019S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019). \n10 The Judge\u2019s discretion does not extend to ignoring the plain language of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99\u00ad\n0557, 2000 WL 1247736 at *2 (App. Bd.

The Majority does not address this argument; however, it has merit. \nThe Judge discounted the DoD psychologist\u2019s concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, stability, and trustworthiness, and instead relied upon her evaluation as evidence in \nfavor of Applicant\u2019s suitability for security clearance eligibility. Specifically, the Judge found \u201cthe \nmost persuasive evidence\u201d in his Guideline I analysis \u201cto be the evaluating psychologist\u2019s opinion \nthat \u2018[Applicant] does not appear to meet criteria for any current mental health disorders\u2019 and the \nabsence of any security significant behavior since Applicant embraced AA and his sobriety.\u201d \nDecision at 12 (quoting GE 3 at 1). This analysis is problematic for several reasons. First, it \nemphasizes Applicant\u2019s remedial alcohol conduct as mitigating of his mental health concerns and \nthereby conflates the two issues despite that they are \u2013 as the Board made clear in its previous \ndecision \u2013 separate and distinct. See USAF-M No. 23-00056-R at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2023). \nMoreover, in reaching the foregoing conclusion, the Judge failed to explain his reliance on \none passage of the psychologist\u2019s evaluation as \u201cthe most persuasive evidence,\u201d while \nsimultaneously disregarding that same psychologist\u2019s multiple and weighty concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s current trustworthiness and stability. A judge\u2019s decision must be a commonsense \ndetermination based on consideration of the evidence as a whole, not just those pieces of evidence \nthat support his final decision. See AG \u00b6 2(c); ISCR Case No. 94-0964, 1996 WL 648762 at *3 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996). Even if it was appropriate for the Judge to decline to apply AG \u00b6 28(b) to \nthe opinion about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness, that opinion \nremains substantial evidence about the characteristics expected of those entrusted with access to \nclassified information. \nCuriously, the Judge does not challenge the psychologist\u2019s opinion about Applicant\u2019s \nmaterial defects, but rather embraces it in his analysis for why AG \u00b6 28(b) should not apply, despite \nthat \u201cApplicant has poor judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness.\u201d Decision at 11. By \nnot analyzing this opinion, even independently from AG \u00b6 28(b), the Judge is essentially \nconcluding that, as long as there is no diagnosis associated, it is acceptable for security clearance \nholders to have poor judgment, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness. Such a conclusion is \ncontrary to the purpose of DOHA adjudications and undermines the Directive\u2019s essential purpose \nof protecting classified information. See ISCR Case No. 16-02592 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, 2018); \nISCR Case No. 01-24356, 2003 WL 21430899 at *3 (App. Bd. Feb. 26, 2003). \nAdditionally, the psychologist \u2013 the only mental health professional to offer an opinion in \nthis case \u2013 provided detailed concerns about Applicant\u2019s mental health status, which also \nwarranted evaluation in the Judge\u2019s decision. Although a judge is not required to discuss each and \nevery piece of record evidence, his failure to discuss important aspects of a case is error. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 03-07874 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2005). Here, the Judge failed to mention, let alone \ndiscuss those legitimate concerns, which include that: Applicant has had numerous overseas \ndeployments and assignments cancelled as a result of his self-harming behavior; alcohol use \ndisorder, which was diagnosed as recently as about eight months prior to the March 2022 \nevaluation, is \u201coften a lifetime illness prone to relapse;\u201d while alcohol contributes to Applicant\u2019s \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npoor decision-making, he has also demonstrated self-harm with no indications of alcohol use; and \nthere is a high possibility that Applicant could decompensate significantly without treatment. GE \n3 at 1-3. By not acknowledging these concerns, the Judge failed to sufficiently analyze how \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy history of mental health issues \u2013 including serious manifestations thereof in \n2014, 2017, 2019, and 2021, some of which occurred with little or no alcohol consumption \u2013 are \nmitigated other than through the mere and relatively brief passage of time without incident and \nrelatively recent cessation of drinking. \nMisapplication of Guideline I Mitigating Conditions \nThe Government next argues that the Judge\u2019s Guideline I mitigation analysis is arbitrary, \ncapricious, and incomplete. Other than to note that the Judge \u201centered robust findings on the \nGuideline I issues and thoroughly detailed his reasoning and analysis,\u201d the Majority summarily \nconcludes that the Government\u2019s argument amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence. This conclusory rejection leaves the Government\u2019s legitimate argument \nsubstantively unaddressed. \nThe Judge found three mitigating conditions \u201cpartially or completely applicable,\u201d \nincluding AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (d), and (e). Decision at 11-12. He subsequently failed, however, to \nsufficiently analyze those factors in light of relevant evidence that contradicts their application. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) affords mitigation when both \u201cthe identified condition is readily controllable \nwith treatment, and the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan.\u201d During the March 2022 evaluation, the DoD psychologist referred Applicant for \ncontinued mental health treatment, including medication management. GE 3 at 3. This \nrecommendation was made separately and distinctly from Applicant\u2019s express intention to \ncontinue attending AA six or seven times per week. Id. As of the hearing, Applicant was engaged \nonly in medication management with his general practitioner, participated in no other mental \nhealth treatment, and had reduced his AA participation by half. Tr. at 50-51, 53-54. The Judge \nappears to have credited Applicant\u2019s AA participation as mental health treatment, noting that \nApplicant \u201ctreats that as his therapy.\u201d Decision at 9. This credit, however, is inexplicable and \nunsupported by anything in the record or Appeal Board caselaw. Applicant\u2019s failure to engage in \nmental health treatment \u2013 something expressly recommended by the psychologist as part of \nApplicant\u2019s treatment plan \u2013 renders mitigating condition AG \u00b6 29(a) inapplicable. \nAG \u00b6 29(d) is a three-prong condition that affords mitigation when \u201cthe past \npsychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation has been resolved, and the \nindividual no longer shows indications of emotional instability.\u201d Here, the analysis fails at the first \nprong because the record is devoid of evidence that Applicant\u2019s conditions of security concern \nwere temporary. To the contrary, Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of mental health issues and diagnoses \nis well-evidenced, including suicidal ideations continuing from 2007 to as recently as September \n2021, and repeated violent self-harming behaviors from at least 2014 to as recently as June 2021. \nMoreover, the DoD psychologist opined explicitly about the current and ongoing nature of those \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues if left untreated. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s mental health concerns were \n\u201ctemporary\u201d is unsupported by the record and therefore application of AG \u00b6 29(d) was erroneous. \nFinally, AG \u00b6 29(e) affords mitigation when \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem.\u201d \nThe Judge appears to rely on the passage of less than two years without a reported incident and the \nsupport of Applicant\u2019s command to conclude that Applicant\u2019s mental health concerns are not \ncurrently a problem. In doing so, however, the Judge disregarded unfavorable record evidence, \nincluding the psychologist\u2019s concerns about material defects in Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nstability, and trustworthiness, and her opinions that those material defects remain constant and \nthere is a high possibility that Applicant could decompensate significantly without ongoing \ntreatment. Judges have considerable latitude when applying disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under the Directive; however, that discretion is not unlimited. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n98-0611, 1999 WL 33127159 at *1 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 1999). In light of the record, less than two \nyears without incident is insufficient to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 29(e). \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe Judge\u2019s whole person analysis failed to consider significant contrary evidence. He \nobserved that Applicant \u201cwas sober from July 2021 until May 26, 2022, when he had one beer[,] . \n. . realized it was a mistake, contacted his sponsor, and has not had a drink since,\u201d that he \u201cplans \non remaining sober one day at a time for the rest of his life,\u201d and that \u201cthere have been no additional \n[mental health] incidents since Applicant got a grip on his alcohol problem in July 2021.\u201d Decision \nat 12. Generally speaking, promises of future good behavior carry less weight than \u201ca track record \nof reform and rehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008). This is \nespecially so in light of Applicant\u2019s multiple prior attempts to abstain, followed by resumed \ndrinking. \nThe remainder of the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis was based on favorable character \nreferences, which the Judge acknowledges as \u201clay evidence.\u201d11 \u201cThere is some point at which \nevidence, though it exists, becomes so slight and so thoroughly outweighed by contrary evidence, \nthat it would be an abuse of discretion to base a decision upon it.\u201d Lauvik v. I.N.S., 910 F.2d 658, \n660 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons already addressed, such is the case here. In total, Applicant \nhas had four significant incidents of concern since 2014, two of which occurred with admitted \nalcohol interaction, one of which occurred after having consumed only two beers, and one of which \noccurred without any known alcohol consumption; has completed mandatory ADAPT three times; \nand has unsuccessfully attempted abstinence three times for periods ranging from 10 months to \ntwo years. The favorable evidence relied upon by the Judge is too scant to overcome the concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s longstanding, and currently largely unaddressed, mental health concerns. \n11 The Judge highlighted two letters as particularly helpful. See Decision at 9 (citing AE B; AE C). It bears noting that \nthe authors of those letters met Applicant after he returned to the U.S. following the incident overseas in July 2021, \nand therefore had each known Applicant for less than two years as of their letters of support. \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). A favorable \nclearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. See AG \u00b6 2(b). In the instant case, the record \ndiscloses many reasons to doubt Applicant\u2019s current judgment and reliability and to conclude that \nhe has failed to meet his burden of persuasion regarding mitigation. The Judge\u2019s analysis failed to \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, failed to consider important aspects of the \ncase, and ran contrary to the weight of the record evidence. Furthermore, the record evidence \nviewed as a whole is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Egan \nstandard. Accordingly, I would reverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n16 \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nOn January 2, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat her behavior and circumstances raised security concerns under Guideline I (Psychological \nConditions) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017). In an undated document, Applicant \nsubmitted a reply to the SOR. \nOn November 16, 2022, the DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services revoked Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information, and she appealed that revocation under the \nprovisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and she elected that process. On March 31, 2023, after \nconducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nLeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge improperly applied factual findings that were \nunsupported by the record and that he failed to properly consider all available evidence and \nmisapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant serves on active duty in the military. Married and divorced twice, she has two \nminor children. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2018 and is working on a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nShe has submitted letters from current and former military personnel supporting reinstatement of \nher security clearance. \nApplicant has experienced trauma and difficult circumstances. These include sexual \nmolestation as a child by a relative, sexual exploitation as an adolescent, two abusive marriages, \nseparation from her children while serving in the military, a suspected sexual assault while serving \noverseas, and insensitive racial comments by a military superior.  \nWhile serving overseas in November 2018, Applicant voluntarily sought treatment for \ndepression and anxiety and was treated with psychotropic drugs. In the summer of 2019, she \nreceived nonjudicial punishment for a six-hour unauthorized absence. About that time, she was \nvoluntarily admitted for three days to a psychiatric hospital for depression. During that treatment, \nshe admitted to tying a stocking around her neck, denied it was a suicide attempt, but rather claimed \nit was a cry for help.  \n[Applicant] also disclosed . . . that she had thoughts of hanging her children so that \nshe could \u201cstop the cycle of pain.\u201d (Tr. 55-60) She attributed her depression to \nbeing away from her children for two years of overseas duty and sea duty. She was \ndiagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and major depressive \ndisorder (MDD), single episode, moderate, by history. (GX [Government Exhibit] \n5) [Decision at 3.] \nShortly thereafter, Applicant was transferred to a military medical facility in the United \nStates where she was diagnosed with MDD and placed on limited duty. In November 2019, she \nreturned to full duty and was later reassigned to another installation.  \nIn October 2020, Applicant had a confrontation with her division officer. She interpreted \nhis reference to her as the \u201celephant in the room\u201d as being racial in nature. Decision at 4, citing \nApplicant Exhibit (AX) N. During that month, Applicant was evaluated and determined to be not \npsychologically fit for duty.

She submitted a complaint with the Inspector \nGeneral that a mental health provider abused her position by retaliating against her for seeking \nassistance regarding her divorce. A month later, Applicant\u2019s squadron reported to the DoD \nConsolidation Adjudication Facility (CAF) that her security clearance was suspended.  DoD CAF \nrequested Applicant undergo a medical evaluation. \n[On July 16, 2021,] Applicant was evaluated as having MDD and suspected trauma \ndisorder secondary to childhood abuse. She was found to have a borderline \npersonality disorder that requires a substantial amount of psychotherapy and \nwillingness to commit to treatment. The evaluator observed that she does not have \ngood insight into her behaviors, indicating a poor prognosis and high likelihood \nthat she will continue to experience psychological decompensation in response to \nstressors. The evaluator concluded that her psychological condition suggested an \nimpairment in her ability to properly safeguard classified information and perform \nsensitive duties. [Decision at 4, citing GX 5, emphasis added.] \nIn September 2021, Applicant was assigned to sea duty. About a month later, her \ncommanding officer requested that she be evaluated. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD), found not to be psychiatrically fit for full duty, and recommended for continued \noutpatient treatment.  In January 2022, she was referred to a physical evaluation board (PEB).  \nFollowing a physical confrontation with her sister in February 2022, Applicant locked \nherself in a bathroom and used a razor blade to make three horizontal lacerations on her wrist. The \npolice had to remove the bathroom doorknob to reach her. She was hospitalized but determined \nto be at a low risk for suicide.  \n[Applicant\u2019s] long-term risk was determined to be elevated because of her chronic \ninability to cope with psychosocial stressors. The evaluator noted, \u201csuicide risk \nlevel is not static and can change based on changes in psychosocial variables.\u201d \nApplicant was diagnosed with Other Personality Disorder (mixed narcissistic and \nborderline features), with PTSD and MDD by history. Medical personnel found no \nevidence of other clinical depression, mania, anxiety, psychosis, or other major \npsychiatric disorders.  [Decision at 5, citing GX 6 at 4, 6.] \nIn October 2022, a psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant with PTSD, MDD, and borderline \npersonality disorder. In March 2023, the PEB entered an informal finding that Applicant was unfit \nfor duty because of PTSD. She did not accept the informal finding and requested a formal PEB \nhearing.  \nSince her hospitalization in February 2022, Applicant has been compliant with her \ntreatment regimen, but her medical records do not reflect a favorable prognosis. While she has \nnot engaged recently in any violent or self-destructive behavior, she has been in a controlled \nenvironment and has not been confronted with the type of stressors that contributed to her \npsychological problems. \u201cShe presented evidence of her progress in overcoming her psychological \nconditions, but not enough to overcome the security concerns.\u201d  Decision at 10. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s Most Recent Psychiatric Evaluation \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his analysis of her most recent psychiatric \nevaluation. This evaluation was conducted by Dr. C in February 2023. \nFirst, Applicant notes the Judge erred in finding that this evaluation was conducted in \nFebruary 2022.  This error, however, was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of \nthe case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020).  \nSecond, Applicant repeatedly highlights in her brief that Dr. C rated her low on the scales \nfor depression, anxiety, and PTSD. \nDr. C\u2019s evaluation contains the following chart and \ninformation: \nRATING SCALES: \nDATE \nPHQ-9 (Depression) \nGAD7 (anxiety) \nPCL-5 (PTSD) \n10/20/21 \n4 \n15 \n69 \n12/14/21 \n27 \n21 \n76 \n1/12/22 \n14 \n-\n-\n2/8/22 \n17 \n19 \n72 \n2/24/22 \n17 \n11 \n47 \n3/17/22 \n11 \n11 \n41 \n4/29/22 \n15 \n13 \n48 \n5/13/22 \n6 \n5 \n16 \n6/14/22 \n12 \n19 \n-\n2/21/23 \n0 \n1 \n3 \nKey \n5 = Mild \n10 = Moderate \n15 = Moderate to \nSevere \n20 = Severe \n5 = Mild \n10 = Moderate \n15 = Severe \n38 + = Significant \n2/21/23 C-SSRS [Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale] = 0 [AX F at 1-2.] \nDr. C\u2019s evaluation further states that the rating scales \u201cwere all in the subclinical range which was \nconsistent with [Applicant\u2019s] conditions being resolved or in full remission.\u201d Id. at 2. However, \nthe long-term significance of these ratings was not explained. Given the fluctuation of her ratings \nover the 16-month period reported, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s reluctance to rely on that data. \nThird, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider Dr. C\u2019s favorable prognosis in \napplying certain mitigating conditions. Specifically, she asserts: \n[T]he month prior to her evaluation, her \u201ctherapist transitioned her to follow-up \nonly as needed.\u201d  This prognosis was never even considered by the Administrative \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge.

Dr. [C] opined that [Applicant\u2019s] \u201crisk to harm \nself or others in the near future is low\u201d and that \u201cshe has the capacity to make \nmedical decisions and to seek help if her condition worsens.\u201d The Administrative \nJudge inexplicably leaves this favorable recent prognosis from his analysis.  \n[Appeal Brief at 12, underlined emphasis added.] \nWe note that Dr. C\u2019s evaluation does not contain any section or statement designated as a \n\u201cprognosis.\u201d While the Directive does not define the term \u201cprognosis,\u201d it is generally defined as \n\u201cthe prospect of recovery as anticipated from the usual course of disease or peculiarities of the \ncase.\u201d See https://merrian-webster.com/dictionary/prognosis. In other words, a prognosis is a \nprediction or forecast of the likely outcome of a medical condition by a medical professional and \noften uses descriptive terms such as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cguarded,\u201d \u201cpoor,\u201d or \u201cgrave.\u201d We do not \ninterpret the portions of Dr. C\u2019s evaluation that Applicant cites as a prognosis of the likely outcome \nof her diagnosed conditions. Said differently, Applicant has not established that the Judge erred \nin concluding that her medical records do not reflect a favorable prognosis. \nFinally, regarding Dr. C\u2019s evaluation, we note the Judge correctly found that: \n[Applicant] was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD, both in remission. \nThe \npsychiatrist opined that she was fit for duty in a shore-based environment where \nshe has close support from family and access to mental health care, but that she \nwould be a risk for recurrence of symptoms if placed in a high-stress environment \nwith limited social support. The psychiatrist recommended that she not be assigned \nto sea duty or unaccompanied overseas duty due to the risk of symptom recurrence. \n[Decision at 5.] \nThese findings support the Judge\u2019s key conclusion that, while Applicant has shown progress in \novercoming her psychological conditions, this progress is not enough to overcome the alleged \nsecurity concerns. \nAdjudicative Desk Reference (ADR) \nApplicant\u2019s brief relies upon provisions in the ADR to support her arguments. These \narguments are not persuasive. DOHA judges are required to decide cases by using the Directive \nand Adjudicative Guidelines, not the ADR. The ADR itself states that \u201cit is not U.S. Government \npolicy and may not be cited as authority for denial or revocation of access\u201d to classified \ninformation.

Relying on AG \u00b6 27, which provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o negative \ninference concerning the standards in [Guideline I] may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling\u201d (emphasis added), Applicant also argues the Judge drew an impermissible, \nnegative inference that she is \u201cstill a \u2018current problem\u2019\u201d because she is \u201cstill using counseling.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 13. These arguments are frivolous. The Judge found that, based on Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and other evidence, three disqualifying conditions were established. These are AG \u00b6 \n28(a) \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness . . . that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited, to irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal . . . behaviors;\u201d AG \u00b6 28(b) \u201can opinion \nby a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition that may impair \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness;\u201d and AG \u00b6 28(c) \u201cvoluntary or involuntary \ninpatient hospitalization[.]\u201d \nThe evidence established that Applicant engaged in suicidal gestures or attempts; that she \nhad homicidal thoughts; that her commanding officer referred her for a mental health evaluation; \nthat a licensed psychologist diagnosed her in mid-2021 with mental health conditions that suggest \nan impairment of her ability to properly safeguard classified information and opined her prognosis \nwas poor; that she was hospitalized more than once for mental health conditions; that she \napparently is not currently deployable due to her mental health conditions; and that she is going \nthrough the PEB process to determine whether she is fit to remain on active duty in the military. \nSuch evidence raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s stability, reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness.  \nThe Judge did not draw a negative inference solely because Applicant sought mental health \ncounseling. From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a \nsecurity concern are based on substantial evidence. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, setting forth the \nsubstantial evidence standard. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence. As the Board has noted in the past, an ability to argue for a different interpretation \nof the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016). In short, none of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the \nJudge\u2019s analysis of the evidence contravened the requirements of the Directive. We find no reason \nto disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the alleged \nsecurity concerns.  \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that she should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On December 5, \n2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W. \nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had three delinquent consumer debts; that he filed for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 2014 that was discharged in 2015; and that he filed for Chapter 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbankruptcies in 2019 and 2021 that were dismissed. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted \neach allegation with explanations. The Judge found against him on all of the allegations. In \nsummarizing the decision, the Judge acknowledged that Applicant was supporting a large family \nwith inconsistent income and employment, has health issues, but paid some debts and received \nfinancial counseling. However, after getting a fresh start from a 2015 bankruptcy, he financially \noverextended himself. Applicant still owes a number of debts, including three alleged in the SOR. \nHis intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. He does not have a track record that would enable \nthe Judge to trust that he will pay the remaining SOR debts, and he failed to act responsibly under \nthe circumstances or make a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal reargues the case that was raised in response to the Government\u2019s File \nof Relevant Material and discusses new evidence. He does not assert that the Judge committed any \nharmful error, but that the Judge was not \u201cprivy to the ongoing efforts by myself to correct past \ncircumstances and behavior which led to this my financial circumstances.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at \n1.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nS. Marshall Griffin, Jr., Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 30, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nAugust 5, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Charles C. Hale \ndenied Applicant security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant carried delinquent debt totaling approximately $33,000 \nacross 18 consumer accounts. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations, \nexplaining that the debts were incurred by his now-estranged wife without his knowledge, and \nasserted that no payments had yet been made for any of the debts.

He is a high school \ngraduate and attended community college. He has been married three times and pays child support \nand insurance premiums for children from those marriages. A credit report obtained the day before \nthe hearing showed Applicant\u2019s debt had increased from the amount alleged in the SOR to over \n$45,000. The majority of the debts became delinquent in mid-2022. Applicant testified that his \nwife, who has filed for divorce, was responsible for paying bills and that he did not know how to \npay the bills when she became ill. Applicant contacted various debt relief companies and, on the \nday after the record closed, he enrolled with one and made an initial payment of $299.50. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence established an \ninability to satisfy debts and a history of not meeting financial obligations under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) of Guideline F. He further concluded that, although Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties may have been impacted by circumstances beyond his control, he had not \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. \nDiscussion \nDue Process \nApplicant alleges that he was denied due process with respect to his pro se status at the \nhearing. He does not claim that he was denied the opportunity to obtain counsel, but rather \ncomplains that the Judge \u201cfailed to ensure [Applicant] understood the process in which he was \nrepresenting himself.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 3. However, on at least four occasions, Applicant \nreceived notice of his right to retain counsel and his responsibilities at the hearing, giving him \nample opportunity to seek clarification of any concerns he might have had. \nFirst, he received a copy of the Directive along with the Statement of Reasons and was \nthereby informed of the \u201copportunity to present evidence on his or her own behalf, or to be \nrepresented by counsel or personal representative.\u201d Directive \u00b6 4.3.4. Second, when the \nGovernment provided Applicant with copies of its proposed hearing exhibits, Applicant was \ninformed that, \u201c[a]t the hearing, you may represent yourself, retain an attorney, or be assisted by a \npersonal representative, such as a friend, family member, or union representative.\u201d Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) II. That letter also provided Applicant with another copy of the Directive and specifically \nidentified the Adjudicative Guidelines and the Additional Procedural Guidance that addressed the \nhearing process. Third, along with the Notice of Hearing, Applicant received a copy of the Chief \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s Prehearing Guidance Memorandum which informed Applicant of his right \nto counsel and, again, explained the hearing process. HE I. Fourth, a May 8, 2024, e-mail from the \nJudge provided Applicant with additional guidance, a link to DOHA\u2019s Industrial Security \nClearance web page, and another copy of the Directive. Finally, at the beginning of the hearing \nthe Judge addressed many of the hearing\u2019s procedural aspects. Transcript (Tr.) at 4-10. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brief cites as an overarching shortcoming the Judge\u2019s statement to Applicant \nat the beginning of the hearing that he \u201c\u2018assumed\u2019 that [Applicant] understood what was happening \nat the hearing\u201d AB at 3, citing Tr. at 8. He asserts that this assumption was error and that the Judge \nshould have conducted a detailed inquiry into Applicant\u2019s understanding of all matters of law and \nprocedure pertinent to the hearing. However, such an inquiry is neither practical nor necessary. \nViewing the record in its entirety, rather than only the excerpt selected by Applicant, it is clear that \nthere was no error in the manner in which the Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s self-representation. \nApplicant\u2019s citation to a single sentence ignores both the pre-hearing information that had been \nprovided and the next sentence in the partially cited colloquy which elaborates: \u201cIf you are \nconfused or uncertain about anything, please request a moment.\u201d Tr. at 8. It also ignores the \nensuing dialog in which the Judge explains various aspects of the hearing to which Applicant \nresponds that he understands. Tr. at 8-9. Additionally, the Judge specifically asked if either party \nhad any procedural matters to be addressed and Applicant answered, \u201cNo, your Honor.\u201d Tr. at 10. \nThroughout the hearing the Judge took additional steps to explain various aspects of the hearing. \nTr. at 13-15 (addressing Government Exhibit 3); Tr. at 15 (explaining options regarding presenting \ntestimony and documentary evidence); Tr. at 16-18 (focusing Applicant\u2019s attention on the specific \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions); Tr. at 41 (offering Applicant a final opportunity to \naugment his case). \nAlthough applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take \ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights and interests under the Directive. E.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 00-0593 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001). There is a rebuttable presumption that applicants, as \nadults, are legally competent and capable of making rational decisions concerning their hearings. \nISCR Case No. 01-20579 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004). This would include, at a minimum, the \ncapacity to inform the Judge of any concerns or confusion. Nothing in either the record or \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief indicates that he lacked the basic mental competence to represent himself \nor make independent choices during the hearing. \nThis allegation of error does not invoke new evidence or facts that were not available at \nthe hearing or suggest any impediment to Applicant raising concerns during the hearing. An \napplicant\u2019s failure to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights does not constitute a denial \nof rights. As such, because Applicant did not raise his concerns with the Judge during the hearing \nor otherwise object to proceeding, he was not denied due process. ISCR Case No. 03-21262 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 10, 2007). Furthermore, we conclude that having not raised any concerns at the \nhearing, Applicant has waived this issue for purposes of appeal. See ISCR Case No. 08-08085 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 21, 2010). \nEven if this had not been waived, the assertion lacks merit. This case is factually dissimilar \nto and distinguishable from the case relied upon by Applicant. AB at 2-5 (citing ISCR Case No. \n03-08257 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2007)). In that case there were numerous identifiable events reflecting \nthe applicant\u2019s lack of understanding of parts of the proceeding. Unlike in that case, there is no \nindication in this record that Applicant \u201cdemonstrated considerable confusion.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n03-08257 at 3. At no time before or during the hearing did Applicant object to proceeding pro se \nor raise a lack of understanding of the proceedings. Nor was there anything in Applicant\u2019s conduct \nduring the hearing that would give rise to an inference that he was confused.

See ISCR Case No. 20-02999 at 2 (App. \nBd. May 12, 2022). Any concerns Applicant may have had regarding the exercise of his rights and \nresponsibilities cannot fairly be placed on the Judge. See ISCR Case No. 19-02819 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 21, 2020). While a judge is responsible for ascertaining an applicant\u2019s basic ability to \nparticipate in the hearing, judges cannot act as a surrogate advocate for applicants. ISCR Case No. \n20-01622 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2022). Merely because Applicant now has decided that he might \nhave presented a better case, it does not follow that he was denied the opportunity to prepare and \npresent his case. ISCR Case No. 00-0250 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2001) (\u201cApplicants are not \nentitled to be relieved of the consequences of decisions and choices they make on how to proceed \nwith their case if they are not satisfied with the results.\u201d). \nBias \nApplicant argues that the Judge \u201cdemonstrated implicit bias\u201d against him and cites as an \nexample that the Judge did not sua sponte intervene when the Government stated that Applicant \nwas going to lose his job. AB at 5\u20136 (citing Tr. at 34). He extrapolates from this that the Judge \nwas \u201cpredisposed to revoke [Applicant\u2019s] security clearance and already decided against \n[Applicant]\u201d AB at 6. He also asserts that the Judge should have kept the record open for a longer \nperiod of time so that he could address his delinquent debts. We do not find his arguments \npersuasive. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking \nto overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. E.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes that the Judge \nwas biased or prejudiced against him but, rather, whether the record \u201ccontains any indication that \nthe Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness and \nimpartiality of the Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003). Claims of \nerror should be based on arguments having a reasonable basis in the record evidence and \nprocedural history of a case, not innuendo or insinuation. See ISCR Case No. 03-14052 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 28, 2005). While the Government\u2019s gratuitous comment was unnecessary, there is no \nindication that it in any way impacted the proceedings or the decision, nor was it something that \nrequired the Judge\u2019s intervention. \nApplicant\u2019s allegation that the Judge was biased because he did not leave the record open \nfor a longer period of time also is meritless. His explanation for this assertion focuses on a \ntheoretical potential mitigation case he might have built by addressing his debts after the hearing \nwas completed. However, DOHA proceedings are not aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s debts. \nRather, a security clearance adjudication is designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness so that a sound decision is rendered. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07\u00ad\n08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). An applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy \nbefore resolving debts might be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 15-01070 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016).

ISCR Case No. 20\u00ad\n03548 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2022). \nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated that, \u201cIf you can give me [a] couple weeks and I \ncan give you paperwork,\u201d documenting his past efforts to address his debts. Tr. at 16. At the \nconclusion of hearing, the Judge noted the Applicant had inferred that there might be documents \nsupporting his testimony. He explained the importance of providing \u201cdocumentary evidence of \nany debt payments, contacts with creditors, and efforts to resolve or otherwise address delinquent \ndebts or evidence of extended deployments in Florida to establish the mitigating factors under the \nDirective.\u201d Tr. at 44-45. In furtherance of this, he kept the record open for two weeks to allow \nApplicant the opportunity to provide additional evidence. Applicant concurred and thanked the \nJudge for doing so. Tr. at 16, 45. At no time during or after the hearing did he ask the Judge to \nkeep the record open for a longer period of time. The Judge was not required to provide Applicant \nwith any post-hearing opportunity to present additional evidence, and it is beyond cavil and \ncommon sense to claim that providing Applicant with exactly what he requested reflected negative \nbias. \nWe find that Applicant\u2019s concerns are insufficient to overcome the rebuttable presumption \nthat the Judge acted in an impartial and unbiased manner. There was no bias or harmful error in \nthe manner in which the Judge conducted the hearing. \nWhole Person Analysis \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief asserting that the Judge erred in his whole-person \nanalysis merely advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that the \nJudge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise, and a bare \nassertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut that presumption. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). \nIn conclusion, we have considered the entirety of Applicant\u2019s arguments and he has not \nidentified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of this case or in his decision. The record \nsupports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 2, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nof the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On March 14, 2024, after a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Eric H. Borgstrom denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom about 2016 to March 2023; that he used prescription stimulants such as Adderall or Vyvanse, \nwhich were not prescribed to him, between April 2017 to April 2023; and that he used cocaine \napproximately 10 times between January 2018 and May 2020, and once in late 2021. Applicant \nadmitted, with clarifications, all of the SOR allegations. The Judge found against him on all \nallegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge failed to consider all relevant evidence submitted \nby Applicant rendering the decision as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-twenties and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2021. He has been \nemployed by a Department of Defense (DoD) contractor since June 2021. He is unmarried and has \nno children. In his 2021 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant reported his use of \nmarijuana, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, Ecstasy, and cocaine. He also admitted to using \nprescription amphetamines (Adderall and Vyvanse) without a prescription. \nIn his SCA, Applicant stated he used marijuana between January 2016 and May 2021, and \nhe intended to continue to use it in the future, although he said he did not intend to use illegal drugs \nwhile employed by a DoD contractor. He also admitted using LSD twice and psilocybin \nmushrooms once between March 2017 and July 2019; prescription amphetamines approximately \nsix times between April 2017 and May 2021; Ecstasy once in September 2019; and cocaine \napproximately 10 times between January 2018 and May 2020. He further admitted to purchasing \nmarijuana from classmates or licensed dispensaries every other month between May 2017 and \n2019, and approximately twice a year between 2019 and May 2021. He purchased cocaine from \nclassmates on two or three occasions between August 2019 and May 2020, and he purchased \nprescription drugs without a prescription on multiple occasions between April 2017 and May 2021. \nHe stated that he did not intend to use LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, Ecstasy, Adderall, and cocaine \nin the future and that he did not intend to use illegal drugs while employed by a DoD contractor, \nbut that he enjoyed experimenting with various drugs and his use had little impact on his mental \nor physical health. \nAt the hearing, Applicant confirmed his responses in his SCA as to frequency and span of \nillegal drug use at that time, and in his statements made during a January 2022 security interview \nand his response to interrogatories about his subsequent use of illegal drugs, Delta-8 \ntetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8) and prescription drugs. In response to interrogatories, Applicant \nadmitted that he used marijuana once or twice between August 2021 and August or September \n2022. He reported his last use of marijuana on March 18, 2023, his last use of Delta-8 on April 1, \n2023, and his last use of Adderall on April 2, 2023. He further admitted that he obtained Adderall \nin March 2023 from his girlfriend who had a prescription. He included a statement of intent to \nabstain from illegal drugs and substance misuse in the future. \nIn contrast, in Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all three allegations with no \ncorrections or revisions as to the drugs identified or the span and frequency of drug use, and he did \nnot claim that his recent \u201cmarijuana\u201d use was in fact Delta-8 or a legal hemp derivative. He stressed \nthat he recently reassessed his priorities and no longer intended to use illegal drugs or misuse \nprescription drugs. On July 5th and 6th 2023, Applicant tested negative for illegal drugs. \nApplicant testified that he is aware that his employer has a drug-free policy, and that he \nhas not informed his supervisor or his Facility Security Officer (FSO) about his illegal use of \nmarijuana, cocaine, and a prescription drug while employed with a DoD contractor. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge found that at the time Applicant used marijuana, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, \nand cocaine, and misused a prescription drug, he was aware such conduct violated federal law and \nhis employer\u2019s drug-free policy. He nonetheless repeatedly illegally purchased and used these \nsubstances. As an aggravating factor, he used cocaine once, marijuana multiple times, and Adderall \nat least once after employed with a DoD contractor and after he submitted his SCA and \nacknowledging its illegality and expressing his intent to abstain from future use. At the hearing, \nhe walked back previous admissions in his answer to the SOR and response to interrogatories \nwherein he admitted, with assistance of counsel, his most recent use of marijuana in March 2023 \nand his most recent use of Adderall in April 2023. At the hearing, he claimed that his March 2023 \nuse of marijuana was in fact, either Delta-8 or another legal derivative, but the Judge did not find \nthe testimony recharacterizing his most recent marijuana use to be credible. \nEven if Applicant\u2019s most recent use of marijuana was a legal derivative, his cocaine and \nAdderall use while employed with a DoD contractor illustrates his cavalier attitude toward federal \ndrug laws and his employer\u2019s policies. He is credited with mitigation for his statement of intent to \nabstain from future illegal drug use, but on the whole, his lengthy and recent history of illegal drug \nuse does not reflect the maturity, good judgment, and adherence to rules and regulations of one \nentrusted to safeguard classified information. He has not demonstrated a sufficient pattern of \nabstinence nor a significant change in circumstances to avoid further drug involvement. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. E.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s counsel argues the Judge did not consider all of the evidence \npresented and applied facts not supported by the evidence. In particular, he argues the Judge erred \nby finding that Applicant never raised the distinction between his use of marijuana and a \u201cTHC \nderivative\u201d prior to the hearing. Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s comment that Applicant \u201ctried \nto \u2018walk back\u2019 some of his \u2018previous admissions in his response to the DOHA interrogatories and \nin his Answer\u2019\u201d was clear error because, he argues, \u201ccontrary to the Judge\u2019s finding, Applicant \nexplicitly stated his consumption in March 2023 was Delta-8 THC and that he purchased it legally \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nin his state at a local store.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 10. He also argues the erroneous finding is \ninseparable from the Judge\u2019s unfavorable creditability determination because the Judge found that \nApplicant lacked credibility because he \u201crecharacterized\u201d two prior admissions. Id. We disagree \nwith Applicant\u2019s interpretation of the evidence. \nIn August 2022, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator, who summarized \nthe pertinent part of that interview as follows: \nDRUG USAGE/INVOLVEMENT: \nSubject listed multiple usages of THC products, Hallucinogenics, Stimulants, \nCocaine/Crack, and Adderall through 05/2021 as reported. Subject advised that he \nspoke to multiple investigators into 02/2022 and 03/2022 and that all of his prior \nusage was full (sic) discussed. Subject volunteered that since his last interview he \nhas continued to use THC products in the form of marijuana, smoking this as well as \n\u2018Delta 8\u201d that he purchases locally at many stores in the region since it is legal to sell \nover the counter.\u2026 Subject was asked if he uses anything else that would be \nconsidered a drug, or illegal material to include common street drugs, and responded \nthat he takes Adderall weekly or as needed mostly due to work demands and pressure \nto get his work projects completed by deadlines. (GE 2) \nSubsequently, Department Counsel issued interrogatories (undated, but propounded prior \nto issuance of the SOR) and asked Applicant to address the above statement.1 In his response to \nthis interrogatory, Applicant stated: \nI deny this as stated. I did say that I used marijuana socially and Delta-8 \nrecreationally. However, when these drugs were being continually used, needs to \nbe corrected. I completed my e-QIP in August/September 2021 and had my \ninterview in August/September 2022.2 In between that time period, I had used \nmarijuana socially 1-2 times because I believed it was okay to continue doing so \noutside of work because it did not interfere with my job in any capacity. Further, \nthe Delta-8 (products containing less than .3% THC) was used after my SF-86 fill \nout recreationally, but not because it was like marijuana. I continued to use Delta\u00ad\n8 products because they are not illegal and could be purchased at most stores, and \nthey gave me relaxation and calmness. Delta-8 is a great alternative to drinking \nalcohol socially, and I do not do it while working. \nI did say that I take Adderall weekly. I stated that I used it on occasion when projects \nrequired it and when applying for jobs. This was not weekly. (Id.) \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) summaries, which were part of the Government\u2019s interrogatories, were \nnot authenticated or certified by Applicant, so upon Applicant\u2019s objection at the hearing, the Judge ordered the PSIs \nto be excluded from Government Exhibit (GE) 2. Of note, certain sections of the PSIs were quoted in the body of the \ninterrogatories and were not excluded from the record. Subsequently, Applicant opened an inquiry in the hearing based \non the August PSI. Apparently based on the Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s inquiry, the PSIs documents remained in the final \nadministrative record. See Tr. 13, 69-79; GE 2. \n2 Applicant completed his SCA on November 15, 2021, and was interviewed by an investigator on January 20, 2022, \nFebruary 28, 2022, March 20, 2022, and August 24, 2022.

In his answer to \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, he stated: \u201cI admit with clarification. During that period, I exhibited immaturity by \nengaging in marijuana use within social contexts. The group of people I associated with were also \ninvolved in such activities\u2026.\u201d \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal, Applicant did not raise the issue of Delta-8 \nuse in his Answer to the SOR. Instead, he admitted in his Answer that he used marijuana until \nMarch 2023. Moreover, in his response to interrogatories, Applicant did not clearly state that he \nused Delta-8 rather than marijuana in March 2023. Rather, his narrative answer was incomplete \nand equivocal. Regardless, Applicant further stated in response to another interrogatory question, \n\u201cWhen did you last use marijuana (month/day/year)?\u201d He answered \u201cMarch 18, 2023.\u201d GE 2 (p. \n25). He was also asked \u201cWhen did you last use Delta-8 THC\u201d to which he replied, \u201cApril 1, 2023; \nand \u201cWhen did you last use Adderall that was not prescribed to you?\u201d to which he answered \u201cApril \n2, 2023.\u201d GE 2 (p. 25-26). In the decision, the Judge noted that Applicant admitted in his response \nto interrogatories that he used marijuana once or twice between August 2021 and August or \nSeptember 2022, and that he last used marijuana on March 18, 2023, and Delta-8 on April 1, 2023. \nDecision at 3. The Judge\u2019s findings in this regard are consistent and supported by the evidence. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge erred by finding that Applicant did not \u201cinform his \nsupervisor or his Facility Security Officer (FSO) about his illegal use of marijuana, cocaine, and a \nprescription drug while employed with a DoD contractor.\u201d AB at 11. Applicant points to a colloquy \nbetween Department Counsel and Applicant at the hearing where Department Counsel questioned \nApplicant about his Adderall use in 2023 and asked if he reported his \u201cuse\u201d to the FSO at [his \ncompany], whereby Applicant answered, \u201cNo, I guess I told my lawyer.\u201d AB at 12, quoting Tr. at \n62-63. The Judge asked, \u201cDoes your supervisor know about your drug use to 2021,\u201d to which \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Tr. at 65. \nWe agree that the record shows that Applicant failed to notify his FSO of his illegal use of \nAdderall and that he failed to notify his supervisor of his illegal drug use. However, the record is \nunclear as to what obligation, if any, Applicant had to do so. As we have recently discussed, we \nare aware of no policy that suggests that a defense contractor\u2019s supervisor or program manager is \nthe appropriate person to receive information concerning security incidents. ISCR Case No. 22\u00ad\n02601 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 22, 2024). Rather, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nadvises contractor employees to self-report certain life events and security incidents to their FSO.3 \nAdditionally, while Applicant could have reported any continued drug use to his FSO, there is no \nevidence in the record that he was required to do so under any policy of his employer\u2019s. In his \nNovember 2021 SCA, Applicant thoroughly disclosed his use of federally illegal drugs and a non-\nprescribed prescription drug. As the adjudicative process continued, Applicant disclosed continued \nuse to background investigators, as he was required to do. Of note, all of the evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s drug use comes from Applicant himself. The record does not support any negative \ninference that Applicant should have also disclosed to others. Regardless, we find that any error in \nthis regard is harmless. The SOR does not allege failure to report drug use to his employer\u2019s \n3 See, e.g., Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Report A Security Change, Concern, Or Threat, \nwww.dcsa.mil/mc/pv/mbi/self_reporting (last visited Feb. 15, 2024). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepresentatives, and Applicant\u2019s failure to report any illegal drug use is secondary to the fact that \nhe violated his employer\u2019s drug-free policy, a factor that the Judge cited and the evidence supports. \nFinally, Applicant argues that the Judge, in discussing Applicant\u2019s intent to use marijuana \nin the future, improperly considered Applicant\u2019s excluded PSI, which was attached to the \ninterrogatories but not adopted by Applicant. Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard is factually \nerroneous. First, he argues that the Judge did not cite to a source for his finding that \u201c[Applicant] \nreported that he had used marijuana between January 2016 and May 2021, and he intended to use \nmarijuana in the future.\u201d AB at 13 citing Decision at 2. In fact, the Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s SCA, \nin which Applicant disclosed those precise dates for THC use and responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question \n\u201cDo you intend to use this drug or controlled substance in the future?\u201d GE 1 at 34. Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s assertion, the cited source directly supports the Judge\u2019s finding. Applicant then argues \nthat the Judge improperly used his PSI, which was not admitted upon his objection, for the \ncontradictory fact that Applicant now states he does not intend to use marijuana in the future, \narguing that \u201cthe alleged fact that the [Applicant] did not intend to use marijuana in the future only \nappears in portions of GE 2 which were excluded from the record due to a lack of authentication.\u201d \nAB at 15 (emphasis in original). However, Applicant stated his intent not to use marijuana at \nmultiple junctures during the adjudication process, including in a Statement of Intent (Applicant \nExhibit E) and at the hearing (Tr. at 34-35). In sum, this assignment of error is meritless. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining assertions amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence. We have noted that such a disagreement or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

From 2001 until he was laid off in 2009, he was employed by a government \ncontractor. Applicant held various jobs between 2011 and 2022, at which time he became a full-\ntime employee of a government contractor. He completed an application for a security clearance \non May 12, 2022, and was granted an interim clearance which was withdrawn in February 2023 \nafter issuance of the SOR, which alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to file Federal and state tax returns \nfrom 2009 to 2021, as well as five delinquent medical account and personal loan debts.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 3, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption), J (Criminal \nConduct), and E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, \n1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing which was held on February 29, \n2024. On March 28, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge LeRoy \nF. Foreman concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guidelines E and J, the SOR as amended alleged six convictions for driving while \nintoxicated or under the influence of alcohol, which occurred between August 1987 and January \n2023. At the time of hearing, Applicant was on probation as a result of his most recent conviction. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted five convictions, denied one, and offered \nexplanations for his conduct. The Administrative Judge found against Applicant as to each of these \nallegations. The SOR alleged under Guideline E that Applicant had falsified his responses to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nSecurity Clearance Application questions pertaining to those arrests, as well as to a question \nregarding the circumstances under which he left a former employment position. The Judge found \nin Applicant\u2019s favor as to two of the arrest-related questions and against him regarding one of the \narrests and the employment question. \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s factual findings, but rather argues that \nthe Judge did not appropriately weigh those facts relative to the Mitigating Conditions. However, \nthe Judge adequately addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances in his decision and reasonably \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct is recent, that it did not occur under unusual \ncircumstances, and that there was no evidence of successful rehabilitation. Decision at 8. \nIn essence, Applicant is advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An \napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. The mere presence of \nsome favorable or mitigating evidence does not require the Judge to make an overall favorable \ndetermination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as Applicant\u2019s. See ISCR Case No. 04\u00ad\n08975 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief.1 \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. \n156, 168 (1962)). His conclusions and adverse decision are sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Appeal Brief at 10. \nAlthough the DOE regulation is wholly inapplicable to this proceeding, DOHA also is committed to fundamental \nprinciples of justice and fairness and nothing in the Judge\u2019s decision is inconsistent with those principles. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 22, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant initially requested a decision based upon the written record but subsequently requested \na hearing, which was held on May 13, 2024. On July 17, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we \naffirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant had failed to timely file federal and \nstate tax returns for tax years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Applicant denied the allegations and submitted \ndocumentation indicating that all the returns had been filed in February and March 2023. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant alleges that \u201c[t]he Judge has committed harmful error based on her \ninterpretation of the record and her decision that unequivocally misrepresented the facts. . . .  The \nharmful error is based on the Judge\u2019s failure to meet the burden of proof required by the \ngovernment, falsifying the facts in the record, arbitrary application of the administrative \nguidelines, and not correctly applying the whole person concept.\u201d Our review of the Judge\u2019s \ndecision confirms that she considered all relevant issues and properly applied the mitigating \nconditions. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is a 58-year old, honorably discharged military veteran who failed to file timely \nfederal and state tax returns for 2019, 2020, and 2021. He maintained that this was the result of a \nbusy work schedule and his failure to make this obligation a priority. Decision at 2; Transcript \n(Tr.) at 28. Although Applicant understood that it was important to file, he felt that he could delay \nmeeting that obligation because he believed he did not owe any additional taxes. Decision at 3; Tr. \nat 31. After submitting his Security Clearance Application (SCA) in which he acknowledged that \nhe had not filed for 2020 and 2021 but did not admit the 2019 failure to file or the three years of \nunfiled state tax returns, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator who addressed the tax \nissues. Applicant advised the investigator that the returns would be filed by November 2022. He \nfiled the returns in February and March of 2023. Applicant also owed federal taxes, interest, and \npenalties for tax year 2012, although this was not alleged in the SOR. This matter was the subject \nof a dispute with the IRS, and Applicant stated that he would not pay those taxes at this time but \nwould do so if his second challenge to a U.S. Tax Court ruling is not resolved in his favor. Tr. at \n25-36. This was not considered for disqualifying purposes but was appropriately considered in the \napplication of mitigating conditions, in making a credibility determination, and in the Judge\u2019s whole-\nperson analysis. \nIn light of these facts, the Judge concluded that Applicant provided no plausible basis for his \nfailure to file tax returns, and despite Applicant's subsequent tax filings, he had not established that \nhe acted responsibly and in good faith to address and resolve his tax obligations. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s factual findings as well as her conclusions. \nWhen an administrative judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether \nthe findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record and \nwhether the judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. \nDirective, E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2\u20133 (App Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). In deciding whether \nthe Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the decision to determine whether: \nit does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its \nconclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does \nnot consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important \naspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. \n97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nApplicant asserts that \u201cthe Judge failed to maintain the burden of proof required of the \nGovernment.\u201d However, the government's burden is to prove its case by substantial evidence, \nwhich was clearly met in this instance. Once the government established a prima facie case against \nhim, Applicant had the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance. Thus, the burden was on Applicant to \npresent witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his failure to timely file his tax returns. Directive E3.1.15. \nRelative to mitigation, Applicant\u2019s arguments broadly allege that the Judge made factual \nerrors in her decision. This challenge largely conflates \"facts\" with \"conclusions.\" Regardless, \nhowever, of whether considered to be facts or conclusions, the allegations of error are without \nmerit because the Judge\u2019s factual findings and conclusions are amply supported by the record. \nBeginning with admissions in Applicant\u2019s SCA and following through to his SOR answer, his \ntestimony at the hearing, the Government\u2019s exhibits, and his own, it is undisputed that the tax \nreturns at issue were not filed until February 2023 \u2013 years after they were due. Thus, the \nGovernment\u2019s burden was met. \nA person who repeatedly fails to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. E.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05478 at 4 (App. Bd Oct. 2, 2017). We have noted that \u201c[a] \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national \nsecrets. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation.\u201d Id at 3. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a \ndirect bearing on an applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation as reflected in the Guideline F concerns that were alleged. Id at 4. Applicant\u2019s failures \nto comply with Federal and state tax laws suggest that he has a problem with voluntarily abiding \nby well-established government rules and regulations, which calls into question his suitability for \na security clearance. See Id at 3. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal is premised on the incorrect belief that he mitigated the Government\u2019s \nconcerns because he filed his delinquent tax returns prior to the issuance of the SOR and that his \nfailure to timely file was justified because he believed he was owed refunds. However, the \nobligation to timely file Federal and state income tax returns is legally independent from whether \nthe person is entitled to a refund or not. ISCR Case No. 97-0176 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 1998). A \nsecurity clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at inducing an applicant to meet his or \nher duty to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). \nAccordingly, even though Applicant eventually filed his tax returns, the Judge was obligated to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding the failure to timely meet tax obligations. Id. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating an \napplicant's case for mitigation because an applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only \nafter being placed on notice that his clearance eligibility is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nself-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to \nhis own interests. ISCR Case No. 15-05478 at 4. In this case, Applicant's filing of his income tax \nreturns for 2019 \u2013 2021 after submitting his SCA and undergoing his background interview appear \nto have coincided with his effort to obtain a clearance and undercuts the weight such remedial \naction might otherwise merit. Tr. at 32, 29. Evidence suggesting that after years of apparent \ninattention, Applicant was finally energized to file his tax returns when his clearance eligibility \nmight be imperiled raises questions about his willingness to follow the rules governing classified \ninformation when his personal interests are not at stake. E.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01070 at 4 (App. \nBd. Mar. 9, 2016) (an applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts \nmight be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information). \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An \napplicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that \nthe Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise, and a \nbare assertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut that presumption. \nE.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below. The record supports a conclusion \nthat the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department \nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered \nfor national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-00254 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence & Security) \nRonald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military personnel whose \nclearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the date of that \nmemorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process set forth in \nDoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). As a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s \nmemo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive the process set forth in the Directive, and \nhe elected that process. On June 13, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in his early 50s, served in a Reserve and then a National Guard capacity from \n1996 to 2012, receiving honorable discharges from both. He has been a civilian employee of the \nmilitary since late 2021. The SOR alleged concerns stemming from Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol \nuse. Specifically, Applicant was arrested in 2010, 2017, and 2018 for charges including \nDischarging a Weapon in City Limits, Injury to Property, Possession of a Firearm While \nIntoxicated, Assault, Harassment, Crimes Against Person, Making a False Report, Trespassing, \nBurglary, and public order crimes, all of which occurred while he was intoxicated. Additionally, \nApplicant was terminated from his employment as a defense contractor in 2017 following an \nincident that also occurred while he was intoxicated. In consideration of the foregoing and in \nconjunction with his request for security clearance, Applicant participated in a mental health \nevaluation in July 2022. The evaluating psychologist opined that, based on discrepancies between \nhis self-reporting and available records, Applicant was not candid with information regarding his \nalcohol use history. Applicant\u2019s medical records reflected a history of alcohol use and \npsychological issues, including suicidal ideations and behaviors, and diagnoses of Alcohol Use \nDisorders and Depressive Disorder. When questioned about the inconsistencies, the psychologist \nfound that Applicant provided insufficient information to clarify or explain the discrepancies and \ndownplayed the significance of past events. \nThe Judge held that the record clearly evinced \u201cApplicant\u2019s succession of abusive drinking \nincidents in 2017 and 2018\u201d and lacked any corroborating support for his claims to have abstained \nfrom alcohol since 2020. Decision at 10. Moreover, the record contained insufficient evidence \nregarding Applicant\u2019s pre-2017 drinking practices to assess his risks of recurrence. The Judge \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s track record of alcohol-related incidents creates continuing security \nconcerns over risks of recurrence, which remain despite Applicant being \u201ccredited with continuing \nsobriety by his own substance abuse counselor and the director of his church support group.\u201d Id. \nAdditionally, the lack of favorable mental health evidence, such as an updated diagnosis and \nprognosis or documented follow-up counseling with a credentialed mental health professional, \nweakened Applicant\u2019s claims of improvement. The Judge found against Applicant on all \nallegations and, for the reasons stated below, we affirm. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant largely reiterates the same arguments and explanations he already \noffered regarding his criminal charges, alcohol consumption, and mental health evaluation. For \nexample, he argues that the 2022 mental health evaluation included incorrect information, namely \nthat Applicant had a \u201chistory of recurrent suicidal ideations [and] suicidal behaviors.\u201d Government \nExhibit 3 at 1. The psychologist relied on Applicant\u2019s Veterans Affairs treatment records to reach \nthis finding for the evaluation. Id. Applicant avers, however, that the only incident that could be \ninterpreted as a suicidal gesture occurred in 2011, that he discussed that lone incident with the \npsychologist, and that he has never otherwise expressed or acted on an intention to commit suicide. \nApplicant previously addressed this disagreement with the psychologist\u2019s finding in his response \nto the SOR and again at hearing. See Tr. at 31-33. There is a presumption that the Judge considered \nall of the record evidence, which would include Applicant\u2019s rebuttal to the psychologist\u2019s finding, \nand Applicant\u2019s belief that the Judge should have weighed the evidence differently is not sufficient \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto overcome or rebut that presumption on appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-01642, 2002 WL \n32114497 at *3 (App. Bd. Jun. 14, 2002). \nApplicant next challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he failed to corroborate his sobriety. \nAppeal Brief at 2. The Judge found that, \u201cWith two years of claimed sobriety (inclusive of the \nthree months he has been enrolled in his church group), [Applicant] asked for simple reliance on \nhis word that he has maintained his sobriety sans any corroborating support.\u201d Decision at 6. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the Judge acknowledged his participation in a ministry support \ngroup beginning in late 2022 but found the record evidence lacking to corroborate Applicant\u2019s \npurported sobriety dating back to 2020. Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard amounts again to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that \nthe Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence supports that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOrder \nThe Judge\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

On September 9, 2022, \nApplicant answered the SOR. \nOn October 26, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, and he appealed that revocation under the provisions of \nDoDM 5200.02.

Applicant responded to those allegations on March 9, 2023.  At \na hearing session held on April 5, 2023, the Government moved to add two new Guideline E \nallegations, and that motion was granted. On April 26, 2023, the hearing reconvened to provide \nApplicant the opportunity to submit evidence regarding those new SOR allegations. \nOn May 31, 2023, after close of the record, DOHA Administrative Judge Robert E. \nCoacher denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. Consistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe Decision: The Judge\u2019s pertinent findings of fact and conclusions are summarized or \nquoted below. \nApplicant, who is in his fifties, is a civilian employee of a defense agency. For many years, \nhe has worked as a security manager or personnel security specialist for Federal entities. He served \nin the miliary for about ten years and received an honorable discharge in 1999. He has a 100% \ndisability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs due to injures incurred while serving in \nAfghanistan. He holds multiple degrees, including a master\u2019s degree. He has held a security \nclearance since 1992. \nApplicant is twice divorced. The Guideline D and J allegations involve stepdaughters from \neach marriage. One stepdaughter (SD1) is from his first marriage (1993-2012) and the other (SD2) \nis from his second marriage (2014-2017). \nDuring an interview with a criminal investigator in 2017, SD2 detailed alleged sexual \nmisconduct committed by Applicant, including that he touched her genitalia to examine her for \nbody piercings, that over a four-year period he spanked her on the buttocks with a belt and his \nhands while she was naked, and that he digitally penetrated her vagina under the guise of checking \nto see if she was a virgin. Following SD2\u2019s allegations, Applicant was issued protective orders, \nreassigned, and barred from an overseas military base. \nDuring the hearing testimony, Applicant admitted that he checked SD2 for body \npiercings, but denied that he touched her vagina while doing so. He claimed that \nhe was concerned about her health. He states that she was topless and in her panties \nduring this viewing. He had her lay down and he claimed: \u201cI grabbed the top of \nher panties and I just looked at it and that was it.\u201d He admitted telling his boss, Mr. \nC, that he viewed her genital area.  [Decision at 4.] \nIn March 2018, SD1 also accused Applicant of sexual abuse, which allegedly occurred \nbetween 2003 and 2008. Applicant was subsequently indicted for conduct stemming from these \nallegations and arrested. Applicant was released from custody on bond and is required to wear an \nankle monitor.  His trial on the criminal charges is scheduled for later this year.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe original SOR was in a narrative format. At hearing, the Judge requested that \nDepartment Counsel state the specific allegations in the original SOR so that he could make precise \nfindings of fact, which she did both on the record and in writing. See Hearing Exhibit V. \nThereafter, the Judge noted: \nUnder Guideline D, [the SOR] alleged that in or around November 2016 and April \n2017, while stationed at an overseas military location (ML-1), Applicant engaged \nin criminal sexual behavior when he sexually abused and/or made sexually abusive \ncontacts with his stepdaughter (SD2) (SOR 1.a). Under Guideline J, it is alleged \nthat Applicant was arrested and indicted on October 14, 2021, in U.S. District Court \non two counts of engaging or attempting to engage in sexual contact with SD1 and \nSD2 (SOR 2.a); the original indictment was voided by a superseding indictment \nfiled on June 9, 2022. The superseding indictment charged Applicant with four \ncounts of sexual contacts or sexual acts against SD2 at ML-1 and against SD1 \n(when she was between the ages of 12 and 16, while residing at an overseas military \nlocation (ML-2) (SOR 2.b).  [Decision at 3.] \nThe Judge found against Applicant on the Guideline D and J allegations. In his Guideline \nD analysis, the Judge stated: \nApplicant denied the allegations. His denials are not credible in light of his \nadmissions of looking at his 18-year-old stepdaughter\u2019s vaginal area to see if she \nhad a piercing, his admission that he queried her on her virginity, and his admission \nthat he used corporal punishment on SD2 by spanking her with her pants and \nunderwear pulled down. I did not find his explanation about why he engaged in \nthese actions with SD2 rather than her mother, W2, credible.  [Decision at 10.] \nThe SOR, as twice amended, also alleges nine security clearance application (SCA) \nfalsifications under Guideline E. These asserted that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nunfavorable employment information in response to questions on SCAs submitted in 2011, 2013, \nand 2019. Applicant denied these allegations. The Judge found against Applicant on all but one \nof the Guideline E allegations, noting, \u201c[w]ith this background [as a personnel security specialist], \nhe was fully aware of his responsibilities to provide truthful, non-misleading information when \nanswering questions about his previous work experiences.\u201d  Decision at 12. \nAppeal Issues \nThere is no presumption of error below. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.19-01689 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJun. 8, 2020). The appealing party has the burden of raising and establishing that the Judge \ncommitted harmful factual or legal error. Id. In his appeal brief, Applicant raises due process \nissues and challenges some of the Judge\u2019s conclusions. \nElection of Security Clearance Adjudication under the Directive \nOn appeal, Applicant first raises related due process issues regarding his adjudication \nelection under Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo. He contends that the DOHA hearing and appeal \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nprocess under the Directive \u201cwas not thoroughly explained\u201d to him and also asserts that he was \n\u201cgiven no opportunity to utilize [his] agency\u2019s security management office (SMO) for guidance\u201d \nunder the Directive\u2019s process. Appeal Brief at 1-2. He further states that he regrets electing the \nDOHA hearing and appeal process.  Id. at 1. We find no merit in these assertions. \nApplicant is raising these issues for the first time on appeal.1 His contentions are refuted \nby the record and the Government\u2019s Reply Brief, which include the following: \na. The Reply Brief contains documents showing that Applicant was provided adequate \ninformation about the adjudication processes. 2 These include (1) a DOHA document dated \nFebruary 10, 2023, explaining the difference between the DoDM 5200.02 appeal process and the \nDirective hearing and appeal process, and (2) the disclosure letter sent to Applicant on February \n23, 2023, providing information about the Directive hearing process and copies of the exhibits the \nGovernment intended to offer into evidence at the hearing. \nb. In his adjudication process election, Applicant stated: \nOf the options that were provided to me on February 10, 2023, I would like to select \nthe process under the 5220.6 process. Your memorandum states that this process \nprovided an opportunity for a hearing prior to denial or revocation of a clearance. \nPrior to the hearing you would be provided with a copy of any evidence that an \nattorney representing the Government planned to present to the Administrative \nJudge at the hearing. The hearing is conducted in the same manner under either \nprocess [i.e., compared to a personal appearance under DoDM 5200.02], however \nunder the 5220.6 process the Administrative Judge would issue a decision which is \nfinal unless appealed to DOHA\u2019s independent three-judge Appeal Board by the \nlosing party, be that the Government or you. \nI would like the process under DoD 5220.6. [Hearing Exhibit IV.] \nThis election reflects that Applicant had a good understanding of the hearing and appeal process \nunder the Directive and of the major difference between the two DoD hearing processes. \nc. Prior to the hearing, Applicant was sent a Notice of Hearing that scheduled the \nproceeding. The notice contained two documents issued by the DOHA Chief Judge, i.e., (1) a \nmemorandum, dated January 10, 2023, explaining the options provided in Secretary Moultrie\u2019s \nmemo, and (2) the Prehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance (ISCR) Hearings \n1 Although there is a sufficient basis to conclude that Applicant forfeited or waived some issues by failing raise them \nin a timely manner in the proceeding below, we will address those issues. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-23356 at 7, \nn. 11 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 2003) (issues may be waived even though the Directive does not address waivers) and DISCR \nOSD Case No. 88-1198 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 1992) (waiver of objection to a motion to amend the SOR by failing \nto raise it at the hearing). \n2 The Appeal Board is generally prohibited from considering new evidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. The Board, however, \ncan consider new evidence when examining threshold issues, such as jurisdiction and due process. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015). In this case, we can consider the documents attached to the \nGovernment\u2019s Reply Brief because they pertain to due process issues that Applicant raises on appeal. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nand Trustworthiness (ADP) Hearings, dated January 15, 2019. This latter three-page document \ndetailed the basic hearing procedures and directed applicants or their representatives to consult the \nDirective for further guidance. In the Government\u2019s disclosure letter, Applicant was provided a \ncopy of the Directive. Furthermore, because Applicant has worked as a personnel security \nspecialist for many years, including at DOHA for a period (Decision at 2), it would not have been \nunreasonable for the Judge to conclude that Applicant was familiar with the Directive and the \nadjudicative guidelines. \nd. At the beginning of the hearing, the Judge asked Applicant whether he understood \u201cthat \nunder the Directive [he had] the right to be represented by an attorney or personal representative \nat [his] own expense[.]\u201d Tr. at 7. Applicant responded in the affirmative. Id. Regarding \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that he was not given the opportunity to consult with his agency\u2019s security \noffice, we note that no provision in the Directive restricts him from seeking assistance from his \nsecurity office in preparing for the hearing. Nor has he cited anything that either Department \nCounsel or the Judge may have said that would have caused him to believe he was prohibited from \nconsulting with his security office before the hearing.   \ne. At the beginning of the hearing, the Judge also explained the basic hearing procedures \nand process.  Tr. at 6-30. The Judge further stated: \nDuring these proceedings, unless you indicate otherwise, I will assume you \nunderstand what\u2019s happening and don\u2019t have any questions or concerns.  If you do \nhave any questions at any time, just let me know and we\u2019ll address them at that \ntime.  [Tr. at 8.] \nAt the hearing, Applicant did not raise any questions or concerns of that nature. While the Judge \ndid stop Applicant at times, such as during his opening statement to tell him that certain matters \nbeing raised were not relevant or that he was repeating himself (see, e.g., Tr. at 40, 42), none of \nthose stoppages would have led a reasonable person to conclude that Applicant\u2019s understanding of \npertinent matters was so deficient that he was not capable of representing himself in this \nadministrative proceeding. \nBased on our review, we conclude that Applicant was provided timely and adequate \ninformation about the DOHA hearing and appeal process and that he knowingly elected to have \nhis case adjudicated under that process. His assertion that the process was not thoroughly \nexplained to him fails to establish that he was denied any due process rights afforded him under \nthe Directive. Furthermore, the fact that Applicant is dissatisfied with the Judge\u2019s decision and \nnow regrets his election of a clearance adjudication under the Directive is not a legitimate basis \nfor vacating that election or for granting him any relief on appeal. \nSOR Amendments \nApplicant asserts that the Government amended the SOR without consulting with his \nagency or the CAS. He further states: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n[T]he Administrative Judge granted the motion to amend the SOR and only \npermitted me 21 days to respond to the amended SOR that my agency and the CAS \nwas not made aware of. I did not have an opportunity to properly respond to the \nnew allegations raised by the government\u2019s attorneys. The [original] SOR details \nwere laid out to me on July 11, 2022, and I was given 60 days to respond at that \ntime to the SOR, the [second] amended SOR provided me 21. Two separate sets \nof amendments were granted by AJ Coacher and I was not given an adequate \namount of time to submit a detailed and proper response therefore I responded \npoorly due to the time constraints placed upon me by the Administrative Judge . . . \nbetween hearings.  [Appeal Brief at 2-3.] \nTo the extent that Applicant is contending that an error occurred by amending the SOR \nwithout consulting the CAS or his agency, this argument lacks merit. Applicant cites no authority \nsupporting this contention. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17 addresses a motion to amend the SOR at the \nhearing and provides: \nThe SOR may be amended at the hearing by the Administrative Judge on his or her \nown motion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to \nrender it in conformity with the evidence admitted or for other good cause. When \nsuch amendments are made, the Administrative Judge may grant either party\u2019s \nrequest for such additional time as the Administrative Judge may deem appropriate \nfor further preparation or other good cause. \nThere is no Directive provision that addresses amending the SOR prior to the hearing. Whether \nSORs are amended before or during the hearings, there is no requirement for the Government or \nthe Judge to consult with the CAS or an applicant\u2019s employer before or after such an amendment. \nSuch a consultation with an employer in an industrial case would likely result in a Privacy Act \nviolation. We also note that Section 10 (Appeal Process) of DoDM 5200.02 does not address SOR \namendments in personal appearances. In short, no procedural error occurred by not consulting \nwith Applicant\u2019s agency or the CAS about the SOR amendments. \nSeventy-one days passed between the issuance of the first SOR amendment and the \ncommencement of the hearing and 21 days transpired between the second SOR amendment and \nthe reconvening of the hearing. At the first session of the hearing, the Judge granted the \nGovernment\u2019s motion permitting the second SOR amendment and, sua sponte, indicated that he \nintended to give Applicant 15 days to further prepare regarding that amendment (Tr. at 156), which \nalso happens to be the minimum period an applicant is entitled between receiving the notice of \nhearing and the commencement of a hearing. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. Applicant responded that \nhe would take the 15 days and did not indicate that he needed more time to prepare. Tr. at 156\u00ad\n159. However, shortly thereafter, the Judge decided to reconvene the hearing 21 days later, which \nalso happens to be one day more than the period an applicant is entitled in responding to an original \nSOR following its receipt. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.4. Applicant asserted no objection to reconvening \nthe hearing on that proposed date.  When the hearing reconvened, Applicant did not assert that he \nwas unprepared or that he needed additional time to prepare. At the second hearing session, \nApplicant testified and offered additional exhibits.  His appeal brief does not assert that, if he had \nbeen giving additional time, he would have proceeded in any different manner. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \nApplicant failed to establish that he requested additional time to prepare either prior to or \nat the hearing. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17 does not specify the length of time that an applicant must be \ngiven to prepare after the SOR is amended. In the absence of a specified period, the Judge\u2019s \ndetermination regarding how much time an applicant should be given to prepare is reviewed under \nthe abuse of discretion standard. In this case, we find no reason to conclude the Judge abused his \ndiscretion in providing Applicant 21 days following the second amendment. In short, Applicant \nfailed to establish that he did not receive fair notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to respond to, \nthe SOR amendments. \nPending Criminal Charges \nApplicant\u2019s brief states: \nWith regards to the SOR issued on July 11, 2022; my criminal defense attorney \nprovided me with specific responses to the SOR. Under my attorney\u2019s advice, I \nwas to respond to each allegation in written form before the request for a hearing. \nEssentially, \u201cNO COMMENT\u201d was the response to the allegations until after the \ntrial which is scheduled to be held [later this year]. During the DOHA hearings, AJ \nCoacher did not object to the government attorneys questioning me again regarding \nthe July 11, 2022, SOR.  The government attorneys continued to ask the questions \nthat were laid out on the written SOR in the hopes of getting a different answer after \nthey were fully aware of the fact my initial responses were: \u201cI contest these \nallegations, and I have pled \u201cnot guilty\u201d to them, and legally I am innocent of these \nallegations, however, given the ongoing nature of the litigation, I have been advised \nby counsel not to specifically detail all the reasons the alleged victim\u2019s statements \nare untrustworthy and factually inaccurate.\u201d [Appeal Brief at 3, quoting SOR \nResponse.] \nApplicant further stated that he was placed in an awkward position about what he could and could \nnot say about the SOR allegations. To the extent that he is contending that his right to remain \nsilent was infringed, we do not find that argument persuasive. Regarding this issue, we first note \nthat Applicant\u2019s comments about the advice he received from the attorney representing him in the \ncriminal proceeding constitutes new evidence that the Appeal Board cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.29. \nApplicants may exercise their right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment \nof the U.S. Constitution when responding to SOR allegations or questions that call for answers \nthat might expose them to potential criminal prosecution. See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 90\u00ad\n0721 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 1992) (noting Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination can \nbe invoked in industrial security clearance cases).3 As an initial matter, Applicant did not ever \n3 Directive \u00b6 6.1 also provides: \nAn applicant is required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to \nrelevant and material questions needed by the DOHA to reach a clearance decision and to otherwise \ncomply with the procedures authorized by this Directive. The applicant may elect on constitutional \nor other grounds not to comply; but refusal or failure to furnish or authorize the providing of relevant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \nexplicitly exercise his right against self-incrimination. At no time before or during the hearing did \nhe object to a question or refuse to respond because the response could potentially incriminate him. \nHis statement in the SOR Response that he was told by his \u201ccounsel not to specifically detail all \nthe reasons the alleged victim\u2019s statements are untrustworthy and factually inaccurate\u201d was not \nraised as a Fifth Amendment privilege issue at the hearing. Since Applicant was representing \nhimself in this proceeding, it was his responsibility, not the Judge or Department Counsel, to \nprotect and invoke his rights. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02196 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2018) \n(although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, \nreasonable steps to protect their rights) and ADP Case No. 18-00329 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2018) \n(Judges and Department Counsel have no authority to provide advice to applicants concerning \nwhat rights they should exercise). Applicant has not established that his right against self-\nincrimination was infringed during the processing of his case. \nAdditionally, Applicant contends that, even though the criminal charges against him are \nstill pending, Department Counsel and the Judge \u201chave already deemed the case against me as \nvalid, and guilt is assumed in the ruling on this matter.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. This argument lacks \nmerit. DOHA proceedings and criminal trials are very different. Of note, DOHA proceedings \napply a much lower standard of proof (substantial evidence) than criminal trials (beyond a \nreasonable doubt). See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, setting forth the substantial evidence standard. In \nDOHA proceedings, a Judge can make findings that an applicant engaged in criminal conduct even \nif the applicant has not been charged with or convicted of that criminal conduct or even if the \napplicant has been acquitted of that criminal conduct. A disqualifying condition that applies in \nthis case highlights this point. Under Disqualifying Condition 13(a), a security concern could arise \nfrom \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 13(a) (emphasis added). In this case, the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant committed \nthe alleged offenses is merely an administrative conclusion that substantial evidence exists in the \nrecord to establish Applicant engaged in security-significant conduct. Applicant failed to establish \nthat the Judge acted beyond the authority provided him in the Directive when he concluded \nApplicant engaged in the alleged sexual/criminal conduct. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02018 at \n4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2021). \nApplicant further requests that his security clearance revocation be suspended until after \nthe criminal proceedings and that he be given an appropriate amount of time to respond to the \namended SOR. Appeal Brief at 4. Applicant is essentially requesting that the proceeding be \ndelayed so that he can develop additional evidence. The Board has no authority to grant that \nrequest. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 12, 2014) (an applicant is not \nentitled to a delayed or deferred adjudication and the Board has no authority to grant an applicant \nan extension for the purpose obtaining more evidence). Furthermore, Applicant has not established \nthat he merits the granting of any exception under Appendix C of SEAD 4. \nand material information or otherwise cooperate at, any stage in the investigation or adjudicative \nprocess may prevent the DOHA from making a clearance decision. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nImpact of Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) Settlement Agreement on Falsification \nAllegations \nSeven of the nine falsification allegations concern Applicant\u2019s responses to questions in \n2011 and 2013 SCAs. These responses involve a position that Applicant held at a Federal agency \nfrom 2009 to 2011. More specifically, the questions asked the reason why Applicant left that \nposition; whether he had been fired, quit, or left a position by mutual agreement following charges \nor misconduct in the last seven years; and whether he had been officially reprimanded, suspended, \nor disciplined for workplace misconduct in the last seven years. Applicant indicated that he left \nthe position at issue for \u201c[c]areer progression to a position at a federal government agency in law \nenforcement\u201d and answered \u201cNo\u201d to the other questions. See Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 15; \nGE 3 at 23. The Judge concluded that Applicant \u201cdeliberately provided false and misleading \ninformation\u201d in his response to those questions.  Decision at 11. \nApplicant basically challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse findings on those seven falsification \nallegations because they contravene a MSPB settlement agreement. He contends, \u201cI did not \nknowingly lie or falsify any government documentation ever in my career and under the agreement \nof the MSPB settlement between [the former agency] and myself, the agency was to remove \nanything that alleged misconduct.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 3. \nIn the decision, the Judge addressed the MSPB settlement agreement by finding: \nApplicant was issued a removal letter for misconduct by his agency on January 6, \n2011. Applicant contested this action before [MSPB]. On May 9, 2011, Applicant \nand the agency entered into a settlement agreement accepted by the MSPB. As part \nof the agreement, the agency rescinded the actions removing Applicant from \nemployment for cause and Applicant agreed to resign from his position, effective \nin August 2011. \nOther than requiring the agency to remove the removal \ndocumentation from Applicant\u2019s official personnel records, the agreement had no \neffect on his two prior disciplinary suspensions. Applicant also agreed never to \napply to the agency for future employment. [Decision at 7.] \nIn his analysis, the Judge concluded, \u201cThe MSPB settlement agreement between the agency and \nApplicant had no bearing on his responsibility to provide accurate information on his SCAs.\u201d \nDecision at 12.4 \n4 The Government argues that the Appeal Board previously addressed this issue and affirmed an adverse falsification \nfinding that involved an applicant who had a settlement agreement expunging the record of an employment \ntermination. Reply Brief at 23 (citing ISCR Case No. 11-07487 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). The facts in that \ncase, however, are distinguishable from the present case; particularly, other evidence existed to support a finding that \nthe applicant intended to conceal information about his employment. The Government also argues that the MSPB \nsettlement agreement \u201cis akin to a conviction being expunged, but the reporting requirements on the SF-86 still require \nit to be identified.\u201d Reply Brief at 23, n. 101. We do not find that argument persuasive. Unlike the questions regarding \nemployment disciplinary actions and removals, the SCA questions regarding an applicant\u2019s police record are \nspecifically prefaced with an instruction to report information regardless of whether the record has been sealed, \nexpunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was dismissed. See, e.g., GE 1 at 51. Conversely, \nthe SCAs in this case have no similar instruction with respect to employment history and do not require the reporting \nof adverse employment actions even if they have been subsequently rescinded by settlement agreement. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPertinent provisions of the MSPB settlement agreement state: \n(1) \u201cThe Agency agrees to rescind the Decision to Remove for misconduct dated 6 January \n2011 with an effective dated of 7 January 2011, and cancel the applicable SF-50 documenting his \nremoval. Neither the issued decision nor cancelled SF 50 will remain in [Applicant\u2019s] Official \nPersonnel File (OPF). Any other documents in [Applicant\u2019s] OPF will be removed reflecting \nthe subject misconduct.\u201d Applicant Exhibit A1 at \u00b6 2 (emphasis added). \n(2) \u201c[Applicant] will sign an SF-52, Request for Personnel Action, documenting his \nresignation effective ninety (90) calendar days after the signing of this agreement.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 5. \n(3) \u201cThe Agency agrees to accept [Applicant\u2019s] resignation effective on 7 August 2011 and \nissue an SF-50 documenting Resignation \u2013 for personal reasons. The SF-50 documenting \nResignation \u2013 for personal reasons will be filed in [Applicant\u2019s] Official Personnel Folder.\u201d Id. at \n\u00b6 9 (emphasis added). \nBased on our reading of the MSPB settlement agreement, the Judge erred in concluding \nthat the MSPB settlement agreement had no bearing on Applicant\u2019s SCA responses. Additionally, \nsince the rescinded Decision to Remove for Misconduct\u2e3awhich would have likely reflected the \nmisconduct at issue\u2e3ais not in the record, it is unknown whether the 2-day and 14-day disciplinary \nsuspensions fell within the scope of the settlement agreement and were removed from Applicant\u2019s \nOPF. \nIn adjudicating falsification allegations, an applicant\u2019s state of mind is often the principal \nissue. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03939 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2023). See also ISCR Case No. \n02-11286 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004) (an SCA omission, standing alone, is not proof of a \ndeliberate falsification); ISCR Case No. 05-03472 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 12, 2007) (the Judge must \nmake findings about Applicant\u2019s culpable state of mind that are reasonably supported by the record \nevidence for an adverse falsification finding to be sustainable). The provisions in the MSPB \nsettlement agreement that provided for the deletion of the removal action and disciplinary actions \nfrom Applicant\u2019s OPF and that characterized his departure from the agency as a \u201cresignation for \npersonal reasons\u201d were significant matters that merited examination. Applicant\u2019s understanding \nof the agreement was a key factor to consider in determining whether he deliberately falsified the \nSCA responses. From our review, we conclude that the Judge erred in failing to analyze the impact \nthe above-quoted agreement provisions may have had on Applicant\u2019s state of mind when he \nresponded to those questions. This error, however, was harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19\u00ad\n01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020) (an error is harmless if it did not affect the outcome of the case). \nBased on our review, the Judge\u2019s adverse finding on one of the two remaining falsification \nallegations is sustainable. Moreover, considering the record in its entirety, the sustainable adverse \nfindings under Guidelines D, J, and E sufficiently support the unfavorable clearance decision. \nApplicant also requests that \u201ca thorough inquiry be conducted to confirm or deny that \nderogatory information was reported in JPAS and to the CAF during this period . . .

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nEric Leckie, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 8, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \nand DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn June 13, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Charles C. Hale \ndenied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged three criminal incidents dating from 2017, 2021, and \n2022. Applicant admitted all allegations in his answer to the SOR, and the Judge found adversely \nto him on all three. On appeal, Applicant highlights that the Judge referred to Guideline E in his \nwhole-person analysis. Through Counsel, Applicant argues that the Judge violated his due process \nrights in considering Guideline E factors, as the SOR alleged no Guideline E security concerns. In \nparticular, Applicant argues, the Judge improperly considered his lack of candor, as \u201c[t]his \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlanguage clearly stems from Guideline E.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 5. In addition to raising a due \nprocess concern, Applicant argues that the decision is arbitrary and capricious because of the \nJudge\u2019s consideration of Guideline E factors. We find neither of these arguments persuasive. \nAs Applicant notes, the Judge erroneously mentioned Guideline E in his decision, stating \n\u201cI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis.\u201d \nDecision at 6. As Applicant also notes, this \u201cis the only mention of Guideline E in the entire \ndecision.\u201d AB at 4. The Judge\u2019s findings of fact and mitigation analysis are exclusively focused \non Guideline J. We do not evaluate a Judge's decision based on isolated words or sentences but \ninstead on the decision viewed as a whole. ISCR Case No. 20-00204 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2022). \nOur review of the entire decision confirms that the Judge\u2019s reference to Guideline E was a \ntypographical error and a harmless one, as it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 95-0495 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 1996). Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, we \ndiscern no due process issue, as the decision gives us no reason to believe that the Judge somehow \nconflated the Guideline J allegations with Guideline E issues or that he improperly applied the \nwhole-person factors. Applicant has not established that he was denied the due process afforded \nby the Directive. Finally, Applicant\u2019s contention that a lack of candor may only be considered in \nthe context of Guideline E is wholly without foundation in the Directive or our precedent. Indeed, \nthe Directive requires us to give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determination regardless of the \nGuideline at issue. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel has failed to establish any harmful error below. None of Applicant\u2019s \narguments are sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence, complied with the requirements of the Directive in his mitigation and whole-\nperson analyses, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On February 15, \n2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Eric H. Borgstrom denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we remand the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant both purchased and used marijuana from about June \n2022 until November or December 2022, including after submitting his security clearance \napplication (SCA). In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted to both allegations in part, \nnoting that he ceased use in September 2022 rather than the later months alleged.

The Judge found against Applicant on both allegations. \nFor the reasons detailed below, we remand. \nFindings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized and quoted below. \nApplicant is in his mid-fifties. He served on active duty in the mid-1990s, during which \ntime he held a clearance. Since September 2022, he has been employed by a DoD contractor. In \nAugust 2022, Applicant completed and submitted a security clearance application (SCA). Under \nSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, Applicant reported no illegal drug use or \npurchases within the prior seven years and reported no drug arrest, drug charges, or felony \ncharges. \nApplicant\u2019s FBI criminal history record revealed a charge in October 2000 for illegal \npossession of a controlled substance without a prescription, a felony. In his September 2022 \nsecurity clearance interview, Applicant \u201cinitially denied any drug arrests or charges.\u201d Decision at \n2. After the agent confronted him with details, Applicant admitted a drug arrest in 2000 but did \nnot remember the details of the charged offense, other than the fact that the charge was later \ndismissed. \nDuring his security clearance interview, Applicant disclosed the following facts about his \nmarijuana use. He first used marijuana in 1988 until 2004, to include using approximately three \ntimes per week around the time of his 2000 drug offense. In March 2022, Applicant suffered a \ntraumatic brain injury (TBI) and other injuries. After obtaining a medical marijuana card, \nApplicant started using marijuana \u2014typically edibles\u2014in June 2022 to manage his pain. He used \nmarijuana daily from June 2022 until early September 2022. He explained to the background \ninvestigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use on his SCA because he did not understand \nthat his marijuana use violated Federal laws. \nIn his May 2023 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant listed his marijuana use as \n2019 to 2022, noted that he associated with a parent and prior spouse who still used marijuana, \nand listed his last use of marijuana as \u201clate 2022.\u201d Id. at 3, quoting GE 5 at 15. \nIn his June 2023 Answer to the SOR, which alleged purchases and use from June 2022 \nuntil at least November or December 2022, Applicant admitted using marijuana from June 2022 \nuntil September 2022 and purchasing from state-licensed dispensaries during those same months. \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant explained that he had obtained a medical marijuana card to \nmanage pain from a TBI and other injuries after a physician identified medical marijuana as a \npotential substance to prevent future strokes and seizes. Applicant admitted that he used \nmarijuana from about 1988 to 1993 and again between 1996 and 2004. He disclosed that he used \nmarijuana occasionally with his then-fianc\u00e9 beginning in 2019, at which time she had a medical \nmarijuana card, and he did not. He stated that he no longer associates with either ex-spouse and \nthat his father no longer uses marijuana. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use, possession, and purchase of marijuana spanned \nfrom about 1993 to 1996, 1996 to 2004, and from 2019 until September 2022. He \nadmitted daily use of marijuana between June 2022 and September 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(c) apply. \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant used marijuana from about 1993 to 1996, from 1996 to 2004, \nand between 2019 and September 2022. He also was charged with a felony drug \noffense in 2000. During his security interview, Applicant reported that he was \nusing marijuana as frequently as three times a week around the time of his 2000 \narrest. He also initially denied any drug arrests, despite the 2000 felony arrest and \ncharge. Applicant did not possess a medical marijuana card when he used \nmarijuana with his fianc\u00e9e beginning in 2019. Any use by Applicant prior to \nobtaining a medical marijuana card in June 2022 violated both Federal and state \ndrug laws. Applicant has not adequately explained why he did not report his pre\u00ad\ninjury marijuana use (with his ex-wife between 2019 and March 2022) or his \nfelony drug arrest in his [SCA]. \nApplicant\u2019s disclosures about his drug involvement and associations have \nbeen inconsistent throughout the security clearance investigation and \nadjudication. In his May 2023 response to DOHA interrogations, he stated that his \nmarijuana use continued until \u201clate 2022\u201d; however, in his June 2023 Answer, he \nstated that his use ended following his September 2022 [security clearance] \ninterview. \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that he did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future. In his FORM Response, Applicant stated \nthat he did not \u201canticipate to have any plans to use marijuana.\u201d Applicant has not \nclearly and convincingly expressed his intent to abstain from marijuana use. AG \n26(b)(3) does not apply. \nI have considered the length, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use. I have also considered that his marijuana use persisted after he \nsubmitted his [SCA] and began his employment with a DOD contractor, and \npotentially after his September 2022 [security clearance] interview. Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use to alleviate pain and reduce the risk of stroke and seizure still \nviolates Federal law and does not mitigate the triggered security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s recreational use of marijuana prior to his injury and his inconsistent \nstatements about his drug use and associations undercut his credibility, reliability, \nand good judgment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDiscussion \nA judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice \nmade.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998).  \n` \nUse of Marijuana After Completing an SCA \nThe appeal in this case raises several issues that merit discussion and require remand. We \nturn first to an issue with the allegations as drafted by the Government and found against \nApplicant by the Judge\u2014that Applicant both purchased and used marijuana from June 2022 to \nNovember or December 2022, including after he completed his SCA. The evidence of record \nindicates that Applicant completed his SCA on August 18, 2022, and ceased using medical \nmarijuana in September 2022, after he met with the investigator for his security clearance \ninterview. That is, the record confirms use for a brief period after Applicant submitted his SCA \nand prior to his interview. The question before us is whether that post-SCA use is of independent \nsecurity concern as the Government alleged and the Judge found. \nThe belief that post-SCA drug use raises additional security concerns hinges entirely on a \nlong-standing presumption of notice: that when an applicant completes a SCA, he is alerted by \nSection 23.1(\u201cIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances?\u201d) that illegal drug use is of security concern. Given the state and Federal illegality of \nmarijuana use, this language was presumed to put applicants on notice that any continued use of \ndrugs demonstrates both poor judgement and a disregard for security clearance standards. In past \ndecades, that presumption made sense. An applicant who was using marijuana in, for example, \n2010 was doing so illegally regardless of the state in which the use occurred, and it was fair to \nassume that the applicant knew he was using illegally and recognized upon completing the SCA \nthat his illegal drug use was of security concern. Consequently, the Appeal Board has repeatedly \nheld that drug use after completing an SCA raises a substantial question about an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs the pace of marijuana legalization has accelerated in recent years, the presumption \nthat the SCA itself puts applicants on notice has become more tenuous. Notably, although the \nSCA in Section 23 generally advises that the \u201cquestions pertain to the illegal use of drugs . . . in \naccordance with Federal laws, even though permissible under state laws,\u201d the SCA does not \ninform an applicant that marijuana remains illegal under Federal law. Depending on the facts of a \ngiven case, it is foreseeable that some applicants might believe that their state-authorized use of \nmarijuana is legal, and erroneously check \u201cNo\u201d to \u201cillegal use.\u201d The security significance of that \nanswer in terms of a falsification under Guideline E would be defined by the specific \ncircumstances. Regardless of a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d answer, whether or not this question puts \napplicant on notice that continued use of state-legal marijuana is incompatible with being granted \neligibility for access to classified information is a separate matter. Given the dichotomy between \nstate and Federal laws, some applicants may continue to use marijuana products after completing \nthe questionnaire\u2014not in reckless disregard of security clearance standards but in ignorance of \nFederal law. In the subsequent interview, the background investigator may\u2014or may not\u2014clarify \nthe Federal position and put an applicant on notice that such use is Federally illegal and \nincompatible with holding a clearance. \nApplicants cannot be expected to be constitutional law experts or versed in the concept of \nFederal supremacy. The ambiguity between state and Federal drug laws and the ensuing \nconfusion was addressed by the Security Executive Agent in December 2021 in \u201cClarifying \nGuidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed \nfor Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position\u201d \n(SecEA Clarifying Guidance). Relevant to the topic of notice, the Guidance encourages \nemployers \u201cto advise prospective national security workforce employees that they should \nrefrain from any future marijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in the [SCA].\u201d \nSecEA Guidance at 2. Implicit in this guidance is the recognition that the SCA itself no longer \nputs applicants on notice and that employers should affirmatively be providing notice to \nprospective employees. The SecEA\u2019s guidance to employers, however, cannot be presumed to \nhave been followed. \nIn light of these developments, the Appeal Board has in the past year clarified that the \ntiming of notice is fact dependent and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Specifically, \nwe have held that the fact that an applicant used marijuana after completing an SCA or being \ninterviewed is only relevant if the evidence establishes that he understood the security \nsignificance of further marijuana use after initiating the security clearance process and that he \ndemonstrated a disregard of the security clearance eligibility standards by continuing such use. \nISCR Case No. 22-02132 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023); ISCR Case No. 23-00093 at 3 (App. Bd. \nNov. 21, 2023). Once an applicant is on notice, ongoing use continues to have significant \nsecurity concerns in terms of both its illegality and the judgment reflected in that use. See ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). \nHere, the record established that Applicant continued to use marijuana after completing \nhis SCA, but there is no evidence in the record that Applicant understood such post-SCA use to \nbe problematic at the time. Indeed, there is considerable evidence to the contrary.

GE 5 at 8\u20139. Both in his Answer to the SOR and his \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant stated that he stopped using marijuana after that interview in \nwhich the \u201cmore stringent federal guidelines were more fully explained.\u201d Although the Judge \nfound against Applicant on the allegations that he used and purchased marijuana after \ncompleting his SCA, he failed to make any findings or conclusions that Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana after completing an SCA had any added security significance that raised questions \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nor regulations. Instead, the Judge states simply that Applicant\u2019s \u201cignorance or uncertainty about \nwhether marijuana was prohibited under Federal law does not excuse his conduct.\u201d Decision at \n6\u20137. This is error, as the Judge failed to consider an important aspect of the case and failed to \narticulate a rational connection for the facts found and the choice made. We are unable to \nconclude that the error was harmless, i.e., that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant used marijuana \nafter submitting his SCA did not likely affect the outcome of the case. \nDate of Last Drug Use \nThe record presents a conflict regarding the date on which Applicant stopped using \nmarijuana. Because Applicant made two different statements regarding the date of his last use, \nthe Judge found him to be inconsistent on this issue and cited to this inconsistency repeatedly as \na reason for denial. The Judge\u2019s analysis in this regard is in error and necessitates remand. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used and purchased marijuana from June 2022 \u201cuntil at \nleast November or December 2022.\u201d The only evidence of record that supports this end date is \nApplicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories, completed on May 18, 2023. In response to the \nquestion \u201cProvide the date of the last time you used marijuana/THC,\u201d Applicant responded, \n\u201cProbably in late 2022.\u201d GE 5 at 15. The SOR was issued within weeks, interpreting the dates \nfrom Applicant\u2019s response as \u201cNovember or December 2022.\u201d On June 13, 2023, Applicant \nsubmitted his Answer to the SOR, admitting use of \u201cstate authorized medical marijuana\u201d until \nthe \u201cmore stringent federal guidelines\u201d were explained during his security clearance interview in \nSeptember 2022. He explained that he \u201chad recalled the interview was in December, which is not \nverified through my calendar\u201d and added that his \u201clast purchase was on August 29, 2022.\u201d Said \ndifferently, Applicant first provided the equivocal date of \u201cprobably late 2022\u201d and at the first \nopportunity corrected the date to September 2022 after verifying the date of his security \nclearance interview. \nWhen conflicts exist within the record, a judge must weigh the evidence and resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative \nreliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. \n14, 2007). In some cases, inconsistencies in record evidence can be credited to an applicant\u2019s \nintentional omission or changing reports during a clearance investigation where motive to do so \nis apparent. That is not invariably the case, however, and resolution of the inconsistencies must \nbe done in consideration of the reliability of the evidence as a whole. ISCR Case. No. 23-00093 \nat 3. Here, the Judge\u2019s decision poses at least two problems. First, he twice misquotes \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the interrogatories as \u201clate 2022\u201d rather than \u201cprobably late 2022,\u201d which \nmakes the responses appear more inconsistent than they actually were.

The Judge makes no findings that would support a \nconclusion that Applicant made varying answers in bad faith, and our review of the record \nreveals none. His report of a September 2022 marijuana cessation date is buttressed by his \nprompt correction of his earlier mistake, his explanation, and his voluntary disclosures. Here, the \nJudge does not resolve the conflict and instead states \u201cI have also considered that his marijuana \nuse persisted after he submitted his [SCA] and . . . potentially after his September 2022 [security \nclearance] interview.\u201d Decision at 7. With regard to the issue of the terminal date, the Judge \nfailed to consider an important aspect of the case\u2014Applicant\u2019s explanation for the differing \nanswers. Because the Judge cites repeatedly to Applicant\u2019s inconsistent answers as a basis for \ndenial, we cannot conclude that this error is harmless. \nDrug Arrest of 2000 \nOn appeal, Applicant submits documents regarding his arrest for possession of synthetic \nmarijuana in October 2000. While the Board generally cannot consider new evidence (Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.29), it may do so in limited circumstances. The Board has distinguished between \nconsidering new evidence as to the allegations in the SOR, which is precluded as beyond the \nscope of its review, and considering such evidence on threshold issues such as jurisdiction, due \nprocess, or the fundamental fairness of the adjudicative process. See ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 25, 2000) discussing the dilemma posed when new evidence raises a serious \nallegation concerning the fairness and integrity of the proceedings below. For the reasons \ndetailed below, we conclude that the new evidence regarding the 2000 arrest raises issues of \nnotice and fundamental fairness, that it may properly be considered by the Appeal Board, and \nthat it requires remand. \nFirst, we note that the SOR does not allege any arrest or charges. In submitting the \nFORM, however, Department Counsel elected to include a FBI rap sheet that reflected an arrest \nin October 2000 for possession of synthetic marijuana without prescription and listed the charge \nas \u201cFelony 3rd Degree.\u201d The FBI rap sheet did not include any further information about the case, \nto include the disposition of the offense. \nIn his September 2022 security clearance interview, Applicant \u201cwas asked twice if he had \never been charged with a felony\u201d and replied negatively both times.

Applicant then described going to court within a few weeks of the arrest. The \njudge called out the names of people who could have their cases dismissed or expunged, \nApplicant agreed to this resolution, and he was not incarcerated, fined, or otherwise punished. \nApplicant explained to the investigator that he failed to list this incident as a felony arrest \nbecause he did not understand it to be a felony and that he failed to list it elsewhere on the SCA \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause he had forgotten about it altogether or believed it to have been expunged. \nIt is unclear why Department Counsel chose to submit a document that reflects a \npossession charge from 24 years ago with no disposition information. The arrest was not alleged \non the SOR, Applicant had explained in his clearance interview that the charge was quickly \ndismissed, and the Government apparently had no evidence to the contrary. A Judge may \nconsider non-alleged conduct (a) in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in considering \nwhether the applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole-\nperson concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01038 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2013). However, \nwhen conduct is being considered for one of these purposes, it is incumbent upon the Judge to \nexplain its relationship to the conduct alleged in the SOR. Having received this document \nwithout any explanation of relevance or value in the Government\u2019s case, the Judge gave it \nsignificant weight, citing repeatedly in his mitigation analysis to Applicant\u2019s \u201cfelony drug \narrest,\u201d to his failure to report the same on his SCA, and to the fact that Applicant in his \ninterview \u201cinitially denied any drug arrests, despite the 2000 felony arrest and charge.\u201d Decision \nat 6. Although this unalleged conduct was considered in the context of mitigation, the Judge \nfailed to articulate a rational connection between this arrest and the allegations in the SOR. It \nwas harmful error for the Judge to have failed to articulate a nexus or, in the alternative, sua \nsponte amend the SOR and provide Applicant an opportunity to respond. Directive Additional \nProcedural Guidance \u00b6E3.1.17. \nWe note that none of this conduct was alleged and that the last statement is also inaccurate, as \nthe summary of interview clearly reflects that Applicant was asked about felony drug arrests, \nwhich Applicant denied because he did not believe he was charged with a felony. Furthermore, \nthe significance of this failing is reflected in the fact that upon receipt of the Judge\u2019s decision, \nwhich highlighted the weight that he gave to this non-alleged incident, Applicant obtained court \ndocuments that confirm that the FBI rap sheet is simply inaccurate. The arrest in October 2000 \nwas for a misdemeanor, not a felony, no prosecution was filed as a result of pre-trial diversion, \nand the charge was dismissed. Putting aside the broader issue of whether the Judge gave undue \nweight to other non-alleged conduct, we conclude that the Judge clearly gave inordinate weight \nto this erroneous document and that it likely affected the outcome of the case. These \ncircumstances require remand.  \nStatement of Intent \nFinally, the Judge concluded in his mitigation analysis that AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) does not apply \nas \u201cApplicant has not clearly and convincingly expressed his intent to abstain from marijuana \nuse.\u201d Decision at 7. As support of this conclusion, the Judge cites Applicant\u2019s statement in his \nFORM response that he does \u201cnot anticipate to have any plans to use marijuana,\u201d which the \nJudge apparently found to be equivocal. Elsewhere in the same FORM response, however, \nApplicant clearly states that he \u201cwillingly intend[s] to follow and obey all laws, specifically, but \nnot exclusively those concerning marijuana and substance use.\u201d FORM Response at 2. The \nJudge erred in his mitigation analysis under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) as he did not examine relevant \nevidence and failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nWe conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand the case to the Judge to \ncorrect the above-identified harmful errors and for further processing consistent with the \nDirective.

Applicant requested a decision based on the written \nrecord, without a hearing. The Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) \ncontaining the entire record and the Government\u2019s argument. Applicant was provided an \nopportunity to respond, but he did not submit a response. On April 3, 2024, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility.

Under Guideline H, he was alleged to have used \nmarijuana in 2014, while holding access to classified information or in a sensitive position, after \ntesting positive during an employment urinalysis.

Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-sixties, divorced from his third wife, and has one adult child. He \nhas been employed by a defense contractor since November 2020. He was arrested for DUI in \n1983, but the charge was dismissed as nolle prosequi. He was arrested for DUI in 1991, pleaded \nno contest, and was sentenced to probation and fined. He was again arrested for DUI in 1995, was \nfound guilty, and sentenced to probation and fined. He was arrested in 1998 for DUI and was found \nguilty, sentenced to probation, and fined. Again, he was arrested in 2000 for DUI, was found guilty \nand was fined. He was arrested in 2014 and 2020 for DUI, found guilty, and sentenced to probation, \ncommunity service, and fined. Applicant also tested positive for marijuana during an employer-\nsponsored urinalysis in 2014 and retired, while holding access to classified information or in a \nsensitive position. He said it was his one and only use of marijuana. \nApplicant elected to have a decision on the record without a hearing, so the Judge was \nunable to make a credibility assessment. Applicant did not submit any information in response to \nthe FORM to show his work performance, current use of alcohol, or abstinence status. The Judge \nheld that Applicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol use and seven alcohol-related arrests and \nconvictions were disqualifying and noted that no mitigating information was submitted in response \nto the FORM. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant does not allege the Judge committed harmful error, rather he argues \nthe Judge may not have had \u201csufficient information\u201d about his \u201ccharacter and history.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 1. He also corrected or supplemented the record with regard to the number of children he \nhas, his work history, and corrections to official criminal history documents in the record. He also \nargues that he has abstained from alcohol and that his DUIs never interfered with his work. \nDisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). The Appeal Board does not review cases \nde novo. The Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party \nhas alleged the Judge committed harmful error. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32. There is a strong presumption \nagainst the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, \n1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government produces evidence \nraising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of persuasion concerning mitigation. See \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. Because Applicant has not alleged such a harmful error, the decision of the \nJudge denying Applicant security clearance eligibility is sustainable. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOur review of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and \narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On May \n24, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that decision \n\u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a decision on the written record. On January 12, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that, between 2013 and 2022, Applicant purchased and used marijuana. \nIn her response to the SOR Applicant \u201cdeni[ied] in part, that my prior legal use of medical \nmarijuana is anyway indicative of my ability to serve the national interest in trustworthiness and \nreliability.\u201d She attached an Attending Provider\u2019s Statement \u2013 Oregon Medical Marijuana \nProgram which, although not a prescription for the use of medical marijuana, indicated that she \nhad been diagnosed with a medical condition that may be mitigated by the use of marijuana. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant requests \u201ca reversal and waiver to the decision\u201d because \u201ca request \nfor an appearance, or video conference \u2026 should have been emphasized & stated that the only \nway for the Administrative Judge could mitigate my trustworthiness and reliability \u2018not written \nout as an optional request.\u2019\u201d We read this statement as asserting that she was insufficiently \ninformed regarding her choice of forum. Applicant also contends that it was error for the Judge to \nhave concluded that the use of medical marijuana is a \u201creason why the judge is denying my \ncharacter qualifications\u201d for eligibility for access to classified information. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is a 29-year-old cybersecurity specialist who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since January 2022. She holds an associate\u2019s degree, a bachelor's degree, and a master's \ndegree. She married in September 2017 and has never held a security clearance. \nIn her April 2022 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that she used \nmarijuana experimentally once in 2013, abstained until 2019, and then used it both recreationally \nand medically about seven times from 2019 to August 2021. She noted that she had not used since \nAugust 2021 but that she intended to use it in the future. In her May 2022 interview with a security \ninvestigator, Applicant stated that she did not plan to continue her marijuana use unless it becomes \n\u201cfederally legal\u201d and she received a medical prescription for health reasons. In her answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted using marijuana, but denied that her use of medical marijuana \u201cis any \nway indicative of [her] ability to serve the national interest in trustworthiness and reliability.\u201d In \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, she acknowledged an understanding of the DoD prohibition on \nmarijuana use but declined to sign a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future. In her \nresponse to the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), she submitted a copy of her \nstate-issued medical marijuana card, asked for a waiver based on her recent medical diagnosis, and \npromised that her use of cannabis would be strictly medical and not recreational. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant's admissions and the evidence in the FORM \nestablished disqualifying security concerns under Guideline H, AG \u00b6 25(a) (any substance misuse), \nAG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal possession of a controlled substance), and AG \u00b6 25(g) (expressed intent to \ncontinue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such misuse). The Judge concluded that no mitigating conditions were applicable \ninasmuch as Applicant's marijuana use was frequent, recent, and did not occur under circumstances \nmaking recurrence unlikely, and that her environment is essentially unchanged.  \nThe Judge also addressed Applicant\u2019s request for a waiver under Appendix C to SEAD 4. \nHe concluded that Applicant had not provided sufficient evidence to establish that her \nqualifications and potential contributions to national security clearly outweigh the security \nconcerns under Guideline H. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nForum Choice \nIn her brief, Applicant argues that had she known that the evidence she submitted in her \nSOR Answer and in response to the FORM would be insufficient to mitigate her drug use, she \nwould not have elected that forum. Applicant requests that she now be given another opportunity \nto appear at a hearing. This assertion of error lacks merit. \nEnclosure 3 of the Directive explains the differences between a hearing and a decision \nbased on the written record. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 makes clear \u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \nthe applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Applicant was provided a copy of the Directive when \nshe received the SOR. With this information available to her, she chose to have her case decided \non the written record. Nothing in either the record or Applicant\u2019s appeal brief indicates that she \nlacked the mental competence or basic ability to make that decision. The totality of the \ncircumstances reflect that Applicant made informed decisions throughout these proceedings. \nMerely because she now has decided that she might have presented a better case if she had \nproceeded differently, it does not follow that she was denied the opportunity to prepare and present \nher case. ISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000). \nIf Applicant did not appreciate the gravity of her circumstances, it was not due to any defect \nin the guidance that DOHA provided her. See ISCR Case No. 20-02999 at 1 (App. Bd. May 12, \n2022). Although pro se applicants are not expected to perform at the level of attorneys, they are \nrequired to take reasonable steps to protect their interests. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03689 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2018). Any incorrect assumptions Applicant may have made or \nmisunderstandings she may have had regarding her rights and responsibilities under the Directive \ncannot fairly be placed on DOHA or other DoD officials. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03168 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 21, 2017); ISCR Case No. 19-02819 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). \nAfter examining the record as a whole, we conclude that Applicant received adequate \nnotice of her forum options and her right to submit evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01217 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2021). There is no assertion of a procedural irregularity, nor any indication \nthat Applicant\u2019s choice was not freely made. She is merely second-guessing her choice. Thus, \nthere is no basis upon which to grant Applicant\u2019s request to have her case considered a second \ntime, nor is there a basis to provide her an opportunity to expand the record. Absent a showing of \nfactual or legal error affecting Applicant\u2019s procedural rights, she cannot be afforded a second \nchance at presenting her case before a judge. Applicant was not denied the due process rights \nafforded by the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 10-06437 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2013). \nRelated is Applicant\u2019s assertion that it was error for \u201c[m]yself not in attendance physically \nto mitigate the Judge\u2019s assessment of my trustworthiness and reliability.\u201d The Board has long held \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthat when an applicant waives a hearing and chooses to have his or her case decided by a judge \nbased on a written record, the judge has no ability to make a credibility determination based on \nobservation of the applicant's demeanor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0625 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. \n17, 1998). Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error, as the perceived infirmities asserted \nby Applicant are the direct consequence of her choice not to have a hearing. ISCR Case No. 10\u00ad\n06437 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2013). \nMedical Marijuana \nApplicant challenges the judge\u2019s findings as being inconsistent with her \u201clegal\u201d use of \nmarijuana pursuant to her medical cannabis card. However, as the Judge correctly noted in his \nmitigation discussion, \"DOHA proceedings are not a proper forum to debate the pros and cons of \nwhether marijuana should be legal for some purposes, how it should be classified as a controlled \nsubstance, or the merits of DoD policy concerning drug abuse.\" Decision at 5. See also ISCR Case \nNo. 02-08613 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2005). \nUnder Guideline H, AG \u00b6 24 of the Directive, use of an illegal drug or misuse of a \nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \u201cDrugs are defined as mood and behavior \naltering substances, and include: (1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified \nand listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar \nsubstances.\u2019\u201d AG \u00b6 24(a). The Directive does not distinguish between types of illegal drug use. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-06635 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2014). In particular, an \u201cexpressed \nintent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue \ndrug use\u201d is disqualifying. AG \u00b6 25(g). \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) categorizes marijuana as a Schedule I drug and \nmakes it illegal under Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including \nmarijuana. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, \u00a7 812 \u00a7 844. Notwithstanding the Federal ban on marijuana, numerous \nstates and the District of Columbia have legalized certain marijuana-related activity, however, \nthere is no Federal exception for state-legalized medical marijuana. The Supreme Court has ruled \nthat, under the Commerce Clause, Congress may ban the use of cannabis even where states approve \nits use for medicinal purposes. See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn terms of eligibility for access to classified information, the Supreme Court's decision in \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan. 484 U.S. 518 (1988) provides that the grant, denial, or revocation \nof an industrial security clearance is the exclusive province of the Executive Branch of the Federal \nGovernment. See also Executive Order 10865. In Egan, the Supreme Court enunciated the general \nprinciple that \u201cthe grant of a security clearance to a particular [individual], a sensitive and \ninherently discretionary judgment call, is committed by law to the appropriate agency of the \nExecutive Branch.\u201d Egan at 527. The Court reasoned that the President\u2019s \u201cauthority to classify and \ncontrol access to information flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nPresident [citing U.S. Const., Art.

The Court \nstated further that \u201cthe authority to protect [national security] information falls on the President as \nhead of the Executive Branch and as Commander in Chief.\u201d Id. \nState laws cannot override provisions of a Federal national security program under the \nexclusive auspices of the Executive Branch evaluating the security implications of an individual\u2019s \nconduct. \u201c[S]tate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited circumstances do \nnot pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the Department of Defense is not \nbound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state law when adjudicating that individual\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, \n2016). A security clearance adjudication remains a determination that must be made within the \nconfines of the basic premise that use of marijuana remains illegal under Federal law and illegal \ndrug use is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. See ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 14, 2021). Simply put, there is no exception that permits security clearance holders or \napplicants to use marijuana or any other drug that is illegal under Federal laws, regardless of state \nlaws that may permit such use.  \nSecurity clearance-related concerns arising from the legalization or decriminalization of \nmarijuana in a number of states were addressed in an October 25, 2014, memo issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI Memo) and reiterated in clarifying guidance issued in \n2021.1 Consistent with the discussion, above, the DNI Memo unequivocally states that \"changes \nto state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining to marijuana use do not alter the \nexisting National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national \nsecurity determinations.\" The DNI Memo also explicitly states that \u201cunder federal law, use of \nmarijuana remains unlawful,\u201d and \u201cwhile several states have decriminalized marijuana or allowed \nits use for medical or recreational purposes, such use of marijuana remains subject to the applicable \ndisqualifying conditions in the Directive.\u201d See also ISCR Case No. 16-00258 at fn. 2 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 23, 2018). \nThe 2014 DNI Memo confirms that DOHA\u2019s administrative judges retain significant \nlatitude and discretion when evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a security clearance. In \nterms of possible mitigation of drug use, each case is fact-specific and, \"[a]s always, adjudicative \nauthorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, marijuana \nusing the current adjudicative criteria.\" The DNI Memo is deferential to the adjudicative process, \n1 Security Executive Agent Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, \n25 October 2014; Security Executive Agent Memorandum ES 2021-01529, Security Executive Agent Clarifying \nGuidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position December 21, 2021. See ISCR Case No. \n14-03601 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, 2015) in which the Appeal Board cited favorably to the 2014 Memo in response to \nan applicant\u2019s argument that \u201cdenying a security clearance on [marijuana use] alone violates the fundamental \ncommon sense principle.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstating that the \"adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana \nraises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to \ncomply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal laws, when making eligibility decisions \nof persons proposed for, or occupying, national security positions.\" \nWe have long held that applicants who use marijuana after having been placed on notice \nof the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected \nof those with access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJan. 15, 2019). In the present case, Applicant was on notice of the incompatibility of her drug use \nwith holding a security clearance and was given the opportunity to express an intent to refrain from \nfuture drug use. Despite acknowledging federal law and policy, she declined to do so. GE 5. The \nJudge specifically cited to the DNI Memo in his discussion of possible mitigation and noted \nApplicant\u2019s refusal to commit to complying with federal drug laws. When viewed as a totality, and \nin light of Applicant\u2019s statements of intended future marijuana use, the evidence that was before \nthe Judge supports his overall adverse conclusion. \nWaiver \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s determination that her circumstances did not warrant a \nwaiver under Appendix C \u2013 Exceptions of SEAD 4. That section provides adjudicative authorities \nwith the option to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or to \nhold a sensitive position despite failure to meet the full adjudicative or investigative standards. \nUnder that provision a waiver may be \u201cgranted or continued despite the presence of substantial \nissue information that would normally preclude eligibility. Approval authorities may approve a \nwaiver only when the benefit of initial or continued eligibility clearly outweighs any security \nconcerns.\u201d This is an exception to the well-established principle that \"[t]he value of an applicant's \nexpertise to a defense contractor or a military service is not relevant or material to determining the \napplicant's suitability for a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case 99-9020 at 5 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \nIn all instances, administrative judges must resolve any doubts in favor of the national \nsecurity and the result must be clearly consistent with the national interest. Directive \u00b6 2.(b). Judges \ntypically reach these conclusions by weighing applicants\u2019 evidence presented in support of specific \nMitigating Conditions. Within that analysis, \u201c[a]n applicant's technical expertise (or lack thereof) \nis not a measure of whether the applicant is at risk of deliberately or inadvertently mishandling \nclassified information, nor is it a measure of whether the applicant demonstrates the high degree \nof judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons granted access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-04090 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2005). \nAppendix C, however, provides a limited option for a waiver \u201cwhen the benefit of initial \nor continued eligibility clearly outweighs the security concerns.\u201d That is, after a judge concludes \nthat the concerns alleged in the SOR remain unmitigated, the judge may nevertheless grant \neligibility. The Directive and the Appendix are silent on the evidentiary standard of proof for a \nwaiver, but the bar obviously cannot be so low that it can be met with the self-serving statements \nof an applicant or an employer. Instead, the bar must be high, as the unmitigated concerns carry \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrisks that extend beyond any particular project on which an applicant may currently be engaged. \nIn these rare cases, we would expect the applicant to submit the type of evidence that allows a \njudge to address all of the specific risks, benefits, options, and ramifications of a waiver. \nAlthough the Directive and the Appendix do not establish a requirement for a Government \nofficial\u2019s evaluation of an applicant\u2019s skill-value and the heightened risks attached to granting that \nindividual access to classified information, it is difficult to imagine an appropriate case for waiver \nthat does not include the Government\u2019s perspective and endorsement of the same. Absent evidence \nof such an assessment, a judge lacks the requisite evidence to make a knowing assessment of an \napplicant's importance to the Government relative to the risk involved. In this instance, there is no \nevidence other than Applicant\u2019s own proclamation of her value. The judge\u2019s denial of a waiver is \nsupported by the record. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief consists of a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 21, 2020). There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence \nunless the Judge specifically states otherwise, and Applicant\u2019s bare assertion that the Judge did not \nconsider evidence is not sufficient to rebut that presumption. Id. \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 12, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On July 10, 2024, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged two concerns: that Applicant\u2019s wife was a citizen of \nChina and that he believed her to be a spy for China (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that his parents-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of China (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant \nsuspected his then-girlfriend of being a Chinese spy in 2018 and reported those suspicions to \nauthorities but nevertheless married her in 2019 and fathered a child with her. At the Government\u2019s \nrequest, the Judge took administrative notice of certain facts relating to China that were \nsummarized in a Government submission and supported by Government issuances and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \npublications. The Judge found favorably to Applicant on the Guideline B concern involving his \nin-laws and adversely on the other allegations. On appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s \ndecision is arbitrary and capricious. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings of fact are summarized below. \nApplicant is in his early forties, with two bachelor\u2019s degrees and a master\u2019s degree. He has \nbeen employed almost continuously by various federal contractors since 2010, has held high-level \nsecurity clearances, and has received five patents. In July 2019, Applicant married a Chinese citizen, \nbut they separated a year later and divorced in September 2022. Applicant and his ex-wife share \ncustody of their four-year-old son. \nApplicant met D, a Chinese national, in February 2018, when she contacted him from a \ndating website and asked who his employer was. They began dating and, on their second date, D \ntold Applicant that she was in the United States illegally. Applicant, who held a Top Secret/SCI \nsecurity clearance, reported this information to his facility security officer (FSO), who advised \nApplicant that he would likely lose his job if he maintained a relationship with an illegal alien. \nWhen Applicant told D that he could not date her because of her illegal status, she told Applicant \nthat she had been joking and showed him a permanent resident card. \nApplicant and D continued to date, but Applicant thought some of her behavior was strange \nand potentially \u201cred flags\u201d of security concern, to include: that the first question she asked him \nwas about his employer; that she initially claimed to be in the country illegally; that she later \n\u201ctested\u201d him by asking him to fix a software issue on her computer; that she may have investigated \nhis background; and that, while intoxicated on one occasion, D told him that her business model \nwas to steal technology and sell it to the Chinese government. Applicant reported these red flags \nto his FSO and ultimately to the FBI. \nIn about October 2018, FBI agents showed up unannounced at Applicant\u2019s place of \nemployment. Applicant agreed to work with the agents and met with them on about four occasions \nover the next two months, during which he reported approximately 40 red flags, including: D tried \nto recruit him to work as a software engineer for China; he saw pictures of D on her phone wearing \nmilitary fatigues; D had been a member of the Chinese military; D used different dates of birth on \nher Chinese passport and on her U.S. driver\u2019s license; she attempted to log into his cell phone; and \nshe sent him emails with attachments that had the Trojan virus, which could have potentially stolen \nhis data, monitored his keystrokes, and enabled the use of his computer\u2019s microphone and camera. \nAlthough Applicant did not recall filling out any sponsorship documents for D, the FBI \nagents informed him that he was listed as D\u2019s sponsor on documents that D filed to obtain \ncitizenship. The FBI agents told Applicant that he should break ties with D but never confirmed \nwhether they believed D was a Chinese spy. In December 2018, Applicant ended the relationship \nwith D, moved to another state, and started a new job with a different company. \nFrom December 2018 to March 2019, Applicant had no communication with D. In about \nApril 2019, D contacted Applicant and told him that she missed him, that she wanted to work on \ntheir relationship, and that she wanted to have a baby with him. Applicant testified that, in light of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthis turn of events, he no longer suspected that D was a Chinese spy because the FBI agents had \npreviously told him that a spy would never have a baby with their intended target. \nIn April 2019, Applicant traveled to visit D without advising either the FBI agents or his \nnew employer\u2019s FSO about the renewed contact with D and his plans to see her. D became pregnant \nduring this visit. In May 2019, she moved in with Applicant, which he reported to his FSO, and in \nJune 2019 they were married. Although Applicant reported to his FSO that D had moved in with \nhim, he did not mention either his suspicions that she may be a Chinese spy or that he had worked \nwith FBI agents concerning these suspicions at his previous employment. \nIn August 2019, two months after they married, Applicant reported to his FSO that he \nbelieved his wife was a Chinese spy due to her \u201csolicitation\u201d and asking specific questions about \nhis work. FBI agents came to his place of employment to discuss these concerns and subsequently \nbarred Applicant\u2019s entry to his designated workspace. Shortly thereafter, the federal contractor \nterminated Applicant\u2019s employment and he remained unemployed for one year. \nIn January 2020, Applicant\u2019s son was born. Applicant and his wife lived together until July \n2020, when he decided to separate. He did not have any contact with D or his son for about nine \nmonths. In about April 2021, after D sent Applicant a text that said she was going to harm their \nchild, Applicant picked up his son and maintained sole custody for approximately eight months. \nAs of January 2022, they share custody of their son, who spends six months with one parent and \nthen six months with the other. Applicant believes D has remarried but does not know whether she \nis now a naturalized U.S. citizen. He admitted that he was initially apprehensive that D may try to \nreturn to China with his son and reported his concern to the Department of State (DOS), but he has \nreceived assurances that DOS has a system in place to prevent this type of situation. \nIn April 2021, when Applicant started working for his current employer, he reported to his \nFSO and fully disclosed his relationship with his ex-wife. In May 2021, FBI agents from his current \nstate of residence, as well as other government agents, met with Applicant for a period of \napproximately three days discussing details about his relationship with D. An FBI agent informed \nApplicant that D was in the process of being deported in about early 2019 and most likely called \nhim and asked him to father a child with her in order to remain in the United States. The FSO \nestablished a \u201cthreat mitigation plan,\u201d and stated that Applicant is fully compliant with this plan. \nAfter meeting with the FBI and other government agents, Applicant has reported to the FSO any \nconcerns about his communications with D and her attempts to elicit information from him. \nApplicant last met with government agents approximately one year ago. \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2023 response to interrogatories, he noted that D has attempted \nunsuccessfully to elicit information from him by using their son as leverage. She solicited his \nthoughts about geopolitical current events and told him that, if he would provide this information, \nshe would not ask the court for child support. \nApplicant\u2019s current FSO testified at the hearing and recommended Applicant be granted a \nDoD security clearance because he self-reported his concerns about D and is fully compliant with \nthe threat mitigation plan.

The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below: \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nApplicant has continuing relationships with D, a foreign national, and their \nyoung son. Due to these relationships, D has leverage over Applicant which could \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a).1 Applicant has held longstanding concerns \nthat D is a Chinese spy. That relationship, combined with factual information about \nChina and its relationship with the United States, and the record evidence as a whole, \nalso require application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(c), 7(d), 7(g) and 7(h).2 \n. \n. \n. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China and the adversarial \nrelationship China has with the United States. Because of that adversarial \nrelationship, Applicant has a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d of persuasion as to mitigation. In \nforeign influence cases, the nature of the foreign government and its intelligence-\ngathering history are important considerations. \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant, D, and their son reside \nin the United States. . . . Applicant\u2019s relationship with D and his son . . . cannot be \nconsidered casual, and his communications with them are continuing and consistent. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to the United States and his ties in this \ncountry are significant, that information is not sufficient to outweigh the heightened \nrisk of coercion presented by a Chinese national Applicant married, divorced, and \nwho he believed to be a Chinese spy. During the hearing, Applicant stated that he \nmay have exaggerated the facts and now sees there is a logical and reasonable \nexplanation for D's behaviors that does not cause concerns for national security. \nThe Administrative Notice documents report that China\u2019s intelligence \nservices frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens who can use their insider access \nto steal secrets. Applicant was initially very diligent in reporting information that \n1 AG \u00b6 7: (a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n2 AG \u00b6 7: (c) Failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a foreign person, group, government, \nor country; (d) counterintelligence information, whether classified or unclassified, that indicates the individual\u2019s \naccess to classified information or eligibility for a sensitive position may involve unacceptable risk to national security; \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, or employer of a foreign intelligence; and \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are acting to increase the vulnerability of the \nindividual to possible future exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncould impact national security, but he used extremely poor judgment and \ndisregarded reporting requirements in about April 2021. He received a \ncommunication from D, she said she wanted to have his baby, and he made \nimmediate plans to meet with her. He should have reported to the FBI agents he had \npreviously worked with about D\u2019s conversation and his plans to visit her. If he had, \nhe may have discovered she was currently in the process of deportation and having \nhis baby was most likely her plan to remain in the United States. In addition, he did \nnot report to his current FSO, as required, that he was meeting with a Chinese \nnational because \u201cit didn\u2019t occur\u201d to him. . . . There are too many troubling \nbehaviors in the record to dismiss D as a threat to national security. I find there \nremains a conflict of interest because D has leverage with their son, and Applicant \nshould never be placed into a position where he has to choose between his son and \nthe protection of U.S. classified information. Applicant has not met his \u201cvery heavy \nburden\u201d of persuasion, and the foreign influence security concerns are not \nmitigated. [Decision at 8\u20139 (internal citations omitted).] \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nApplicant married a Chinese national who he believed to be a Chinese spy. \nChina\u2019s intelligence services frequently seek to use or exploit Chinese citizens who \ncan use their insider access to steal secrets. In about April 2019, Applicant failed to \nreport adverse information about the Chinese national to the FBI and his current \nFSO, which showed poor judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant has a child with D, a woman whom he believed, up until the \nhearing was conducted, was a Chinese spy. According to Applicant, D has used his \nson as leverage to elicit information from him in the past, and I find it likely she will \ncontinue to use his son as leverage in the future. He is regarded as an expert in a \nspecific field, and China and the U.S. are actively involved in this highly \ntechnological advancement and pursuit. I find Applicant to be an upstanding and \nloyal American, however, he used extremely poor judgment in this scenario, and \nhas placed himself in a compromising position. Applicant was compliant with \nrequired adverse information reporting until approximately April 2019. Following \nhis termination from employment and subsequent divorce, he has purportedly \ncorrected his shortcomings and is now motivated to report all foreign national \ncontacts through the use of a threat mitigation plan. However, his current \nprevention of such problems in the future does not preclude careful consideration \nof his security worthiness in light of his recent poor decision-making and \nirresponsible behavior. Protection of our nation\u2019s secrets remains paramount. Based \non the evidence in the record, I find that personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated.

When an administrative judge\u2019s factual findings \nare challenged, the Board must determine whether the findings of fact are supported by such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light \nof all the contrary evidence in the same record and whether the judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable \ninterpretation of the record evidence as a whole.

Jun. 16, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nWe turn first to the issue central to Applicant\u2019s appeal\u2014whether the Judge erred in finding \nthat he was required to report his April 2019 renewed contact with D and his subsequent visit to \nsee her. As Applicant highlights, the Judge\u2019s finding on this specific issue was dispositive in her \ndecision, weighing heavily in her analysis under Guideline B, Guideline E, and the Whole Person \nConcept. Throughout his appeal, Applicant argues that contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding he was not \nrequired to report this renewed contact in April 2019 and his subsequent visit. \nFirst, Applicant cites to the reporting requirements issued by the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence (ODNI) in SEAD 3 Reporting Requirements for Personnel with Access to \nClassified Information or Who Hold a Sensitive Position (effective June 12, 2017). Specifically, \nApplicant focuses on the reporting requirements for \u201cContinuing association with known foreign \nnationals that involve bonds of affection, personal obligation, or intimate contact; or any contact \nwith a foreign national that involves the exchange of personal information.\u201d SEAD 3 \u00b6 F.2.b.2. As \nApplicant highlights, \u201c[f]ollowing initial reporting, updates regarding continuing unofficial \nassociation with known foreign nationals shall occur only if and when there is a significant change \nin the nature of the contact.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 3, quoting SEAD 3 \u00b6 F.2.b.2 (emphasis in AB). \nApplicant\u2019s arguments in this regard are two-fold. He argues first that the relationship was \nnot \u201ccontinuing\u201d when Applicant met with D in April 2019, as he had earlier ended the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nrelationship, and that it did not become a \u201ccontinuing\u201d relationship until D moved in with him in \nMay 2019, at which point Applicant reported. Alternatively, Applicant argues that because he had \npreviously \u201creported D to the company in San Diego in 2018, applicant had no obligation to re-\nreport at the instance the judge cites in 2019 as reporting is only required after a significant change \nhas occurred, but having a single meeting with D is not a significant change.\u201d AB at 3. He further \nstates it \u201cwas only when they met for the second time and D moved in with Applicant was there a \nsignificant change, that met the threshold for reporting, which is precisely when Applicant reported \nD to the company, as required.\u201d Id. \nThese arguments fail for multiple reasons. First, assuming arguendo that Applicant was not \nin a continuing relationship with D when she contacted him in April 2019, he was nevertheless \nrequired to report that she reached out and that they intended to meet because ODNI requires \nreporting of any contact \u201cwith a known or suspected foreign intelligence entity.\u201d SEAD 3 \u00b6 F.2.b.1. \nSecond, Applicant argues that, because he \u201creported D to the company in San Diego in 2018,\u201d he \nwas not obligated to \u201cre-report.\u201d AB at 3. Here, as throughout his brief, Applicant uses the term \n\u201cthe company\u201d when referring not to an employer but rather to the FBI. Said differently, Applicant \nconflates the two in order to argue that his report to the FBI in 2018 absolved him of any \nresponsibility to inform his new employer regarding D. This is confusing, misleading, and \nincorrect. Regardless of whether he had cooperated with FBI agents in California in 2018, the FBI \nwas not his employer and not his \u201ccompany.\u201d His initial reports to his defense contractor employer \nin California in 2018 in no way discharged his obligation to inform his new employer in Virginia \nas soon as D reached out in April 2019 and asked to renew their relationship. \nWe are not persuaded by any of Applicant\u2019s arguments on this issue. It was wholly \nreasonable for the Judge to find that Applicant was required to report to his current FSO in April \n2019 that D had reached out to him to renew their relationship, that she had discussed having a \nchild with him, and that he had agreed to meet with her. Given the fact that Applicant terminated \nthe relationship in December 2018 at an FBI agent\u2019s recommendation, it was inarguably a \n\u201csignificant change\u201d in the nature of their relationship for him to fly cross-country to meet with D \nand to resume intimate relations, with the result that D became pregnant. We conclude that the \nJudge\u2019s findings in this regard\u2014that Applicant was required to report his renewed contact with D \nin April 2019 and failed to do so\u2014are amply supported in the record and reflect a reasonable \ninterpretation of the evidence. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief argues issues that are less consequential to the Judge\u2019s \ndecision. For example, Applicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious \nbecause she stated that he \u201cdisregarded reporting requirements in about April 2021\u201d when he in \nfact was compliant with reporting requirements at that time. AB at 7\u20138, quoting Decision at 9. \nReading this sentence in context, it is abundantly clear that the Judge was referring to April 2019, \nwhich she references throughout her decision as a pivotal date, and that she simply mistyped the \nyear in this particular sentence. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, this was a harmless error, as it \nin no way affected the outcome of the case. E.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0500 at 2 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2000) (a mere typographical error in a judge\u2019s decision does not warrant remand or reversal). In \nanother example, Applicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201cApplicant married a Chinese \nnational who he believed to be a Chinese spy.\u201d Decision at 10.

The judge says \u201cDuring his July 19, 2022 \nbackground interview, Applicant told the investigator that in the back of his mind, \nhowever, he still thought there was a possibility that D was a spy.\u201d Applicant, being \na logician reasoned that there are two possibilities, either she is a spy or she isn\u2019t. \nThis same logic holds for all people. Because an individual is either a spy or they \naren\u2019t. The same thing could be said about the judge, the prosecution, and more \ngenerally anyone at all. As one is either a spy or they are not. . . . As such the judge \nmakes a factual error here by conflating a logical possibility that someone could be \na spy with the belief that someone is a spy. [AB at 5.] \nThis is a difficult argument to follow, but the record evidence is\u2014in contrast\u2014quite clear. \nFrom the early weeks of their relationship, Applicant suspected that D may be a spy for China, to \nsuch an extent that he reported concerns to his FSO on multiple occasions, reported her to the FBI, \nenumerated at least 40 \u201cred flags,\u201d terminated the relationship, and, after reuniting and marrying, \nagain reported his suspicions. While the Judge may have more accurately described Applicant as \nsuspecting, rather than believing, that D was a spy, any possible error in this regard was harmless, \nas it would have no effect on her analysis or decision. This contention amounts to a matter of \nsemantics. See ISCR Case No. 19-02816 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2021). \nAdditionally, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider relevant evidence and \nimportant aspects of the case. For example, he asserts that his relationship with D \u201cwas and is \nadvantageous to the national security\u201d as he \u201cwas able to identify a great many sources and \nmethods which applicant has reported for the past 5 years, benefiting the national security.\u201d AB at \n2. This assertion is not supported by record evidence and is, in fact, contradicted by Applicant\u2019s \nown argument that his suspicions may have been misplaced, that there were \u201cgreen flags\u201d as well \nas red flags, and that his ex-wife may not have been a spy after all. AB at 6\u20137. To some extent, \nApplicant is arguing in his brief for an alternative weighing of the evidence. Disagreement with \nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the \nevidence is not sufficient to conclude that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions \nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nWe have considered all of Applicant\u2019s arguments and conclude that none is sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor are they \nenough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and \narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJuly 12, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On February 15, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness \ndesignation. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 26 delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,000. The Judge found in \nfavor of Applicant on two allegations and against her on the remaining allegations. \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant points out factual errors in the Judge\u2019s decision and reasserts \nthe reasons why she should have been granted eligibility to hold a public trust position. Consistent \nwith the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her late 40s and is employed by a defense contractor in a public trust \nposition. She married in 1995 and divorced in 1999. She remarried in 2002 and separated in 2018 \nafter nursing her husband back to health following three strokes in 2016. She holds a bachelor\u2019s \nand three master\u2019s degrees. She has previously been employed by defense contractors but has never \nheld a public trust position. \nApplicant has struggled with the management of her finances for many years. She filed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in 1992, which was dismissed. She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcies in 1997 \nand 2007. In her 2007 petition, she reported $18,581 in personal property; no real property; and \ncreditors\u2019 secured claims of $13,906; unsecured claims of $725; and $86,130 in unsecured non-\npriority claims. Following each of her bankruptcy petitions, Applicant returned to accumulating \ndebt beyond her ability to manage and control. \nBetween 2010 and 2021, Applicant accumulated 26 alleged delinquent accounts, and over \n$10,000 in debts not alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s post-SOR attempts to enlist debt counselors \nto help her resolve her delinquent accounts never achieved the positive results she hoped for. \nNeither of these debt service firms were successful in helping her to successfully resolve any of \nher delinquent SOR accounts or the non-SOR accounts covered in her latest credit report. \nApplicant has not provided credible documentation to establish that she has addressed most \nof her SOR debts. Her commitments to address her unresolved SOR debts represent no more than \npromises to resolve her debts and are not a viable substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a responsible way. More concerted debt payment initiatives \ncould be expected of her with the income resources available to her from her full-time employment. \nShe acknowledged overspending as a source of her past financial troubles but failed to document \nany payment initiatives with the bulk of her creditors. Without more, none of the potentially \navailable mitigating conditions can be applied to her situation at this time. \nDiscussion \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant claims that the Judge erred in certain background information \nand did not adequately stress certain other matters in his decision. She stated that her age is 52, not \n49 as noted by the Judge, and she separated from her second husband in 2020, not 2018 as noted \nby the Judge. She notes that she previously held a secret security clearance; she is working with a \ndebt counselor; and she filed bankruptcies in 1992, 1997, and 2007, and listed her bankruptcy \nclaims in greater detail than the Judge\u2019s decision. Finally, she argues that she has managed her \nfinances responsibly since 2007 despite a 2021 financial hardship; that she maintains a good credit \nrating; and that she held security clearances in 2008 and 2017. She states that her past financial \ndifficulties were non-recurring and beyond her control, and that she has been resolving debts with \nthe help of a financial counselor. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nAlthough we agree that the Judge erred with regard to Applicant\u2019s age and date of \nseparation from her second husband, these errors are harmless. The Judge did not make \ninconsistent findings with regard to her past security eligibility or bankruptcy claims.1 Her \nremaining assertions detailing reasons why she should receive a favorable decision constitute a \ndisagreement with the weight the Judge assigned to the evidence. The Judge\u2019s confusion regarding \ncertain background information is irrelevant to the ultimate findings with regard to Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to resolve delinquent debts. \nIn part, Applicant is advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. However, \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that the Judge weighed the evidence or \nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Applicant has not established that the Judge \ncommitted harmful error. Our review of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this \nrecord. \nWe have often stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ncollecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. \n22, 2008). The scope of Guideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial \nsituation, but also extends to his or her financial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not \nrequired to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). However, an \napplicant must act responsibly given his or her circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct even if it may only provide for the payment of \ndebts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). What constitutes \nresponsible behavior depends on the facts of a given case and the fact that an applicant's debts will \nnot be paid off for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited security concern. ISCR Case No. \n09-08462 at 4. Relevant to the equation is an assessment as to whether an applicant acted \nresponsibly given her limited resources See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct \n29, 2009). \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record. \nThe standard applicable to trustworthiness cases is that set forth in Department of the Navy \nv.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 22, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a \nhearing which was held on December 12, 2023. On March 19, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Candace Le\u2019i Garcia denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated \nbelow, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged 14 financial concerns totaling approximately $30,000, which reflect a \nmix of medical and consumer debt, as well as delinquent Federal and state tax debt. In his SOR \nanswer, Applicant admitted some debts while denying others. The Judge found nine allegations in \nfavor of Applicant and against him on the others. An in-hearing amendment to the SOR alleged \nunder Guideline E that Applicant wrongfully disposed of a previous employer\u2019s laptop computer; \nhowever the Judge found that allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor, and that finding is not under review. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends that the Judge\u2019s decision improperly relied upon the delinquency of several \nstudent loans despite the fact that those loans were not alleged in the SOR. Our review of the \nJudge\u2019s decision confirms that she considered all relevant issues and properly applied the \nmitigating conditions. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is 34 years old, married, and has a 9-year-old son. After graduating from high \nschool in 2008, he enlisted in the U.S. military and was honorably discharged in April 2012. \nSubsequent to his discharge he has worked for and been terminated by numerous employers, with \nsome periods of unemployment. He has worked for his current employer since November 2023 \nand also has accepted a position with another employer. He intends to simultaneously work full-\ntime for both employers. Concurrent with his employment, Applicant attended six colleges at \nvarious times since 2010 but has not yet earned a degree. His tuition was paid through the \nacquisition of approximately $50,000 in Federal student loans. Repayment of those loans was in \nforbearance due to a Covid-related emergency relief provision which paused payments, but he was \nto begin repaying the loans in November 2023. He did not do so. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts, which he attributes to periods of \nunemployment and being the sole provider for his family on a minimal income. He acknowledged \nthat he had not managed his finances well and speculated that once he is working two full-time \njobs, he will have sufficient income to pay his debts. After issuance of the SOR, Applicant made \nsporadic, inconsistent efforts at addressing his delinquencies. He entered into an installment \nagreement with the IRS in April 2023, but made only two payments. In December 2023 he entered \ninto a second installment agreement, but as of the time of the hearing his payments were not yet \ndue. He also entered into an installment agreement with the state tax authority in April 2023, but \nonly made approximately three payments. As with the IRS, he entered into another payment \narrangement with the state tax authority in December 2023, but payments had not yet been made. \nIn August 2023, Applicant agreed to an arrangement to pay a delinquent auto loan but he had not \nmade any payments. Similarly, as to the other debts alleged in the SOR that were found against \nApplicant, the Judge concluded that he either had not made efforts to resolve them or did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate any of his claims of payment or resolution efforts. The Judge \nalso considered the character references submitted by Applicant. \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant owes approximately $50,000 in \nstudent loan debt. Tr. at 89. At the time the SOR was issued, Applicant\u2019s student loans were not \ndelinquent because they were in a temporary forbearance status. However, payment of those loans \nwas to resume beginning in November 2023. Applicant testified that he had not made any required \npayments but intended to do so at some unspecified time in the future. Tr. at 94 - 95. \nA Judge may consider non-alleged conduct (a) in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in \nconsidering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying \nthe whole-person concept. E.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01038 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2013). A security \nclearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a \nproceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). The scope of Guideline F encompasses \nnot only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, but also extends to his or her financial history. \nThis includes financial obligations beyond those alleged in the SOR because they are relevant in \nterms of assessing the context of an applicant\u2019s total financial obligations. Nothing in the record \nor the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that she considered the student loans in a manner that is \ninconsistent with this analytical approach. \nAs a general rule, an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for \npaying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 31, 2011). However, an applicant must act responsibly given his or her circumstances \nand develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct even if it may \nonly provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008). Until an applicant has a \u201cmeaningful financial track record it cannot be said as a matter \nof law that he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). The concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track \nrecord\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d Id. \nPayment agreements alone amount to promises to pay in the future, which are \u201cnot a substitute for \na track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible \nmanner.\u201d ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). This is particular so in light of \na history of entering into agreements and not meeting those obligations. The timing of debt \npayments also is relevant in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, in that an applicant who \nwaits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts might be lacking in the judgment \nexpected of those with access to classified information. E.g. ISCR Case No. 15-01070 at 3 (App.  \nBd. Mar. 9, 2016). The presence of some favorable or mitigating evidence does not require the \nJudge to make an overall favorable determination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as \nApplicant\u2019s. E.g. ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn the absence of a meaningful track record of repayments and only a speculative plan for \naddressing his debts, it cannot reasonably be suggested that Applicant initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. The Judge\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence, \nand it was not error for her to find that the manner in which Applicant addressed his debts fell \nshort of mitigation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. \nAn applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for \na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3. Moreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise, and a bare \nassertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut that presumption. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). \nWe have considered the entirety of Applicant\u2019s arguments. The record supports a \nconclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). The \nJudge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security. \nAG \u00b6 2(b). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 31, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline G \n(Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective \nJune 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On July 1, 2024, \nafter a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey \ndenied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted on a collection account \ntotaling $5,919. Under Guideline G, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested for driving while \nintoxicated (DUI) in 2019 and that his medical records from 2019 show a past history of alcohol \ndependence. Also under Guideline G, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s 2022 psychological \nassessment resulted in a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, mild, and in a negative prognosis based \non Applicant\u2019s poor decision making and continued use of alcohol against medical advice.

The Judge found against Applicant on all the SOR allegations except \nthe two allegations under Guideline G involving the 2019 DUI arrest and the allegation of a \nmedical history of alcohol dependence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). On appeal, Applicant argues that the \nJudge\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by the record evidence and the Judge failed to consider \nall of the evidence in mitigation, thus rendering the decision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to \nlaw. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-50s and is employed by a defense contractor. He honorably served \nin the military from 1986 to 1994. The SOR alleged a credit-card debt totaling about $6,000. The \nJudge found that Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he resolved the debt. Applicant \nwas not sure whether he paid the account or whether it aged off his credit report. The Judge found \nthat, regardless of whether the debt currently appears on his credit report, Applicant has failed to \nmeet his burden to prove that his financial issues are resolved. \nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor on the SOR allegation in \u00b6 2.a regarding his 2019 \nDUI arrest. He also concluded that the reference in his 2019 medical records to a past history of \nalcohol dependence was insufficient evidence to support the allegation in \u00b6 2.b. However, \nApplicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist in October 2022 and diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder, mild. He continued to consume alcohol daily from February 2019 to May 2023, \ndespite a doctor advising him to stop drinking in 2019, and several chronic health issues that were \neither caused or exacerbated by alcohol. Despite the doctor\u2019s recommendation and his legal and \nhealth issues, Applicant repeatedly denied having a problem with alcohol. Although he has now \nabstained from alcohol for over a year because of health concerns, the number of years that he \nconsumed alcohol despite his issues cause doubt whether he has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence. \nWith regard to alleged psychological conditions, Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized \nfor two days in 2019 because he either asked a police officer to shoot him in the head or stated that \nhe would shoot himself in the head as he was being arrested for DUI. He was diagnosed with \ndepressive disorder and adjustment disorder. \nApplicant was evaluated in 2022 by a Government-requested psychologist who diagnosed \nhim with depressive disorder and an adjustment disorder, along with alcohol use disorder. The \npsychologist opined that Applicant\u2019s continued use of alcohol caused her to have significant \nconcerns regarding his judgment. She did not opine whether Applicant\u2019s depressive and \nadjustment disorders were temporary, but the Judge found that there is evidence that Applicant \nexhibits several of the symptoms of major depressive disorder. The Judge held that Applicant\u2019s \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npast psychological conditions were not temporary and that there were indications of a current \nproblem, therefore not mitigated. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. E.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that his past financial debts were not raised in discussions \nwith investigators and that he was granted an interim top secret security clearance. He asserts that \nhis financial issues were resolved at the time of the hearing and that his credit report does not list \nthe SOR debt. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s contentions, the credit-card debt listed in the SOR was \ndiscussed during his personal subject interview, he admitted to it in his response to the SOR and \nindicated that it was unpaid, and the allegation was supported by the Government\u2019s April 2023 \ncredit report. \nWe concur with the Judge\u2019s finding that the evidence did not support a favorable resolution \nof the delinquent account, despite its absence from a credit report that Applicant submitted into \nevidence.

Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence. The mere presence of some favorable or mitigating evidence \ndoes not require the Judge to make an overall favorable determination in the face of disqualifying \nconduct such as Applicant\u2019s. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 2 (App. Bd.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 6, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On January 4, 2024, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For the reasons stated \nbelow, we affirm the decision. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and 15 delinquent debts. The \nJudge found favorably for Applicant on the bankruptcy and two delinquent debts and adversely on \nthe remaining 13 debts. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged six falsifications and five instances \nin which Applicant was arrested or charged with an offense.

The favorable findings and related conduct are \nnot at issue on appeal and will not be further discussed. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in his credibility assessment, rendering \nhis decision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings: The Judge\u2019s findings relevant to the appeal are summarized below. \nApplicant is in his mid-40s. He served in the National Guard in the mid-1990s and on active \nduty in the U.S. military from 1995 to 2001, when he was honorably discharged. Married in 1995, \nhe divorced in 2005 and lived with a cohabitant from about 2012 to 2019. He has seven children. \nWhile stationed overseas in 2000, Applicant was arrested by military police on charges of \nbeing drunk and disorderly and failing to obey an order. In his security interview, Applicant stated \nthat he received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice \nfor the incident. In his SOR Answer and at hearing, Applicant stated that he was never formally \ndisciplined for the incident. In 2005, Applicant was stopped by the police for speeding, was \nbelligerent and uncooperative, refused a blood or breath test, and was arrested for driving while \nintoxicated (DWI). He completed a diversion program, and the charge was dismissed in 2006. In \n2007, Applicant was again arrested for DWI, but the charge was ultimately dismissed. The 2007 \nDWI was not alleged in the SOR but \u201cmay be used to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, in the \napplication of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.\u201d Decision at 3. \nIn May 2011, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF-85P). In \nresponse to the question that asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, \nor convicted of any offenses(s)?,\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose that he was \narrested both in 2005 and 2007 for DWI. At hearing, Applicant denied intentionally providing \nfalse information, stating both that he misunderstood the question to be asking about convictions \nand that he believed his DWI arrests to be more than seven years old. \nIn 2012, Applicant refused to leave a bar when requested, first by security and later by \npolice. Applicant was arrested and charged with criminal trespassing and public intoxication, but \nthe charges were later dismissed as the bar owner did not want to pursue criminal charges. \nIn 2014, Applicant was living with a cohabitant (Ms. A) when the police responded to a \ndomestic violence call. Ms. A reported that Applicant choked her during an argument, and the \npolice noted redness on her neck, bruising on her arm, and a welt on her knee. Applicant was \narrested and charged with assault of a family/house member impeding breath/circulation. An \nemergency protective order (EPO) was issued forbidding Applicant from communicating with Ms. \nA, and from returning to the property. When an investigator met with Applicant, Applicant \nadmitted that he placed his hands on Ms. A, but maintained that it was in self-defense. He admitted \nspeaking with Ms. A on the phone and returning to the residence to retrieve belongings. Applicant \nwas charged with violating the EPO, but Ms. A withdrew cooperation in the case and all charges \nwere ultimately dismissed. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt hearing, Applicant denied choking or striking Ms. A.

He also stated that he returned to the property because he and his daughter had nowhere else \nto go and that Ms. A was not present. \nApplicant has not been arrested or charged with any offense since the 2014 incident. In \nSeptember 2022, Applicant submitted a SCA and answered \u201cNo\u201d to all questions concerning a \npolice record, including the question that asked: \nOther than those offenses already listed, have you EVER had the following happen to you? \n. \n. \n. \nHave you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs? \nIn his subsequent background interview in November 2022, Applicant again provided \nnegative answers to all the criminal questions. After the investigator reminded him that they were \n\u201cever\u201d questions, Applicant reported most of the matters discussed above, but he did not disclose \nthe 2007 DWI arrest. \nAt hearing, Applicant denied intentionally providing false information on his 2022 SCA. \nHe maintained that he misunderstood the question to be asking about convictions and that he \nbelieved he only had to report incidents within the past seven years. Additionally, Applicant stated \nthat he discussed the 2007 DWI with the investigator, but that the investigation did not include it \nin the report. Regarding this testimony, the Judge stated: \u201cI did not find Applicant credible. I find \nthe police reports associated with his arrests to be more reliable than his testimony. I also find that \nhe intentionally provided false information on the 2011 SF 85P and the 2022 [SCA].\u201d Id. at 5. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he attributed to a job change in which \nhis salary was drastically reduced and to overextending himself on car loans for his children. The \nSOR alleges a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case and 15 delinquent debts. The debts include a student \nloan, an auto loan, child support arrearages, and 12 miscellaneous debts. There is some evidence \nthat the student loan debt has been forgiven and that the child support arrearage has been paid. The \n12 miscellaneous debts are all included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nApplicant is alleged to have falsified his 2022 SCA and his 2011 SF 85P by failing to \ndisclose his 2005 DWI arrest. Applicant maintained that he understood the questions on both forms \nto be asking if he had been convicted and that he thought he only had to report incidents withing \nthe last seven years. After assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility and considering all the evidence, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nincluding the straightforward nature of the questions on both forms, the Judge concluded that \nApplicant intentionally provided false information on both the 2011 SF 85P and the 2022 SCA \nwhen he failed to report that he was charged with DWI in 2005. Id. at 9, 10. \nRegarding the Guideline E allegations concerning Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct in 2000 \n(overseas incident), 2012 (criminal trespass), January 2014 (assault), and February 2014 violation \nof the EPO, the Judge concluded as follows: \nApplicant was last charged with a criminal offense in February 2014, almost \nnine years ago. That conduct would be mitigated if I believed Applicant. I do not. \nHis conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above \nmitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those \nconcerns. Additionally, having determined that Applicant intentionally provided \nfalse information in an attempt to mislead the government, I have also determined \nthat his testimony about those statements was also false. False statements at a \nsecurity clearance hearing show a lack of rehabilitation, and it would be \ninconsistent to find his conduct mitigated. [Decision at 11 (citation omitted).] \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Chapter 13 bankruptcy case does not generate any security concerns beyond the \ndelinquent debts that are included in it and alleged in the SOR. The allegation concerning the \nbankruptcy is concluded for Applicant, as are the allegations regarding the student loan and the \nchild support arrearages. Applicant began to resolve the other debts through a bankruptcy \nproceeding only after he completed his SCA and was interviewed for his background investigation. \nAdditionally, the Judge noted, \u201cApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case still has years to run, and \nI cannot take him at his word that he will continue with the plan until completion.\u201d Id. at 13. There \nis insufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable \nperiod, that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, or that he made a good-faith effort to \npay his debts. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the \u201ckey\u201d to the Judge\u2019s decision was his assessment that \nApplicant was not credible and argues that the Judge applied this \u201ctheme that the Applicant was \nnot credible\u201d in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Appeal Brief at 2. We agree that the Judge\u2019s \nunfavorable credibility assessment of Applicant was central to his resolution of this case, but we \nfind no reason to conclude that the Judge\u2019s assessment was unsupported by the record or applied \nin an erroneous fashion. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998).  \nThe Directive requires the Appeal Board to give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Although that deference has its limits, an appealing party \nhas a heavy burden of demonstrating that a judge\u2019s credibility determination is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or otherwise unsustainable. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2005). Upon his review of the evidence in this case\u2014to include Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony at the hearing\u2014 the Judge made several discrete conclusions regarding credibility, to \ninclude: that the police reports on the instances of alleged criminal conduct were more reliable \nthan Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding those same events; that Applicant\u2019s version of those events \nwas not believable; that Applicant intentionally provided false information on his 2011 SF 85P \nand his 2022 SCA by failing to disclose his 2005 DWI arrest; and that Applicant\u2019s testimony at \nthe hearing about the same was also false. Those credibility determinations are well within the \nJudge\u2019s authority, and nothing in Applicant\u2019s brief or in our review of the record gives us reason \nto disturb the Judge\u2019s adverse assessment. Applicant may disagree with the Judge\u2019s negative \nassessment of his credibility, but that disagreement is not sufficient to meet his heavy burden of \npersuasion. Id. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge failed to \nconsider evidence in mitigation or misweighed the evidence. The Judge\u2019s decision, however, \nreflects a thorough consideration of all evidence presented, and it notably concludes with favorable \nfindings on several allegations based on evidence presented by Applicant at the hearing. None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the requirements of the \nDirective in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record in reaching his \ndecision.  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision.
