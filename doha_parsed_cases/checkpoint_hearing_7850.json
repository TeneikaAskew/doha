Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 25, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On September 19, 2008, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in failing to conclude\nthat Applicant had mitigated the security concerns in his case.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a fifty-four year old\nengineer who has worked for a defense contractor since 2006.  He used marijuana over 100 times\nbetween 1972 and February 2007.  Applicant has stated the he does not intend to use marijuana again\nbut that he would if it was offered to him.

Applicant has not rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under guideline H, drug involvement. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on June 25, 2008, detailing security concerns under drug \ninvolvement.  \n  \n \nOn July 8, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated August 7, 2008. The FORM contained \nattachments Items 1-5. In an undated letter, Applicant responded to the FORM. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to the material. Applicant's response was admitted \ninto the record. On September 15, 2008, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.e. of the SOR. He admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c of the SOR. \nApplicant neither admitted nor denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old satellite engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since November 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. In 1973, \nApplicant was granted a secret clearance and in 1984, he obtained a top secret \nclearance. No information about his duty performance has been presented. Applicant \nstated, but failed to document, he had many letters of commendation. (Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer to FORM)  \n \n \nIn his November 2006 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), in response to question 24, the use of illegal drugs and drug activity, Applicant \nstates he used marijuana \u201c100+\u201d times between January 1972 and the present. He \nstated within the last 20 years he was present when marijuana was being smoked and \nhe would occasionally take a puff and inhale. (Item 4) \n \n \nIn June 1974, Applicant was a member of the U.S. Navy when charged with sale \nof marijuana, a felony, and convicted of possession of marijuana. He was fined and \nreceived probation. In June 1976, he was honorably discharged from the Navy. (Item 4) \nIn a February 2007-personal subject interview (Item 5), Applicant admitted he used \nmarijuana on occasion. His last use was in January 2007 or February 2007 with old \nfriends at a funeral. (Item 5) Applicant first used marijuana in the 1970\u2019s. During the last \n20 years, he has used marijuana once or twice a year, when available, in a safe place, \nand among friends.  \n \n \nApplicant stated he did not plan to use marijuana in the future, but did state he \nwould smoke it again if offered. In his response to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant states he \nis not a security risk, his use of marijuana was \u201ca couple of puffs here,\u201d and, except for \nthe 1974 incident while he was in the Navy, never used while possessing a security \nclearance. In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated he never smoked \u201cwhile on \nassignment CONUS nor OCONUS.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n \n3\nThe National Defense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year 2008, Public Law 110 \n-181, codified in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, states: \u201cAfter January 1, 2008, the head of a Federal \nagency may not grant or renew a security clearance for a covered person who is an \nunlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict\u201d as defined by federal law.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n \n \n4\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: Use of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical \npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social \nworker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program; \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a duly \nqualified medical professional; \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use.  \n \nFrom the 1972 until early 2007, Applicant used marijuana in excess of 100 times, \nusing it once or twice a year during the past 20 years. He last smoked marijuana in \nJanuary 2007 or February 2007, while with old friends attending a funeral. This last use \noccurred after he had completed his November 2006-e-QIP and was seeking a \nclearance. At the time of his 1974 arrest and conviction, Applicant was a member of the \nU.S. Navy and held a secret clearance. In November 2006, when asked if he would \nsmoke marijuana in the future, Applicant stated he would use if offered marijuana and \nthe occasion conducive. AG \u00b6 25a, 25c, 25g, and 25h apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n \n \n5\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and, \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but \nnot limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, \nand a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e charge Applicant used marijuana when he held a security \nclearance. In 1973 and 1984, Applicant was granted security clearances. He used \nmarijuana from 1972 until early 2007. However, there is no evidence, except for the \n1974-incident, that his use occurred while he held a clearance. In 1974, he held a secret \nclearance when he was arrested for the sale of marijuana and convicted of possessing \nmarijuana. The 1974 incident was more than 30 years ago and, as such, the passage of \ntime lessens the security significance of this event.  \n \nApplicant has denied using while holding a clearance. The government \npresented no evidence refuting his denial. Applicant also denied using while on \nassignment. The disqualifying condition of using illegal drugs while holding a clearance \nmakes no distinction between using at work or while off-duty. Illegal drug use is illegal \ndrug use no matter where it occurs. The issue is whether or not Applicant held a \nclearance while using and the record fails to establish he had a clearance when he \nused. I find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. d and 1.e. \n  \n None of the mitigating factors apply to Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs. AG \u00b6 26a \ndoes not apply because the behavior did not happen long ago. His last use was less \nthan two years ago. He used it in excess of 100 times so his use was not infrequent. \nThere is no evidence his use occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur or \ndo not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. He last used with old friends at a funeral. Seeing old friends at a funeral is \nlikely to recur.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26b does not apply because there is no demonstrated intent not to abuse \ndrugs in the future. Applicant states he will not use marijuana in the future, unless it was \noffered to him and the occasion conducive. There is no showing of a disassociation \nfrom drug-using associates or contacts or a changing or avoiding the environment \nwhere drugs were used. Nor the period of abstinence, which is slightly more than a year \nand a half, an appropriate period of abstinence when balanced against his use over a \n35 year period.  \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 26c does not apply because use of prescription drugs was not an issue. AG \n\u00b6 26d does not apply because there was no satisfactory completion of a drug treatment \nprogram.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use occurred in early 2007, which was after he had \ncompleted his November 2006-e-QIP. Even though he was seeking a clearance, he \nlacked the knowledge that his illegal use marijuana was inappropriate and incompatible \nwith holding a clearance. During the 35-year period from the 1970\u2019s through early 2007, \nApplicant lacked either the knowledge that using marijuana was wrong or the fortitude \nnot to use. Either way, he fails to display the reliability and trustworthiness necessary to \nobtain access to our country\u2019s secrets. His continued marijuana use over a 35-year \nperiod raises questions about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.  \n \nUnder the National Defense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year 2008, Public \nLaw 110-181, codified in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, an unlawful user of marijuana may not be \ngranted a security clearance. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) uses the present tense, making it \napplicable only if the person \u201cis\u201d an unlawful user or \u201cis\u201d an addict. See ISCR Case No. \n03-25009 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005). Based on the evidence, I conclude Applicant is \ndisqualified as an unlawful user of marijuana. He has used it for most of his adult life. \nHe stated he would smoke marijuana if offered to him and the occasion conducive, \nmaking it likely he will continue to use it. I am satisfied Applicant is a present user of \nmarijuana within the meaning of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c. Applicant is disqualified from being \ngranted a clearance.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In 1974, Applicant, while a member \nof the U.S. Navy, was arrested and found guilty of marijuana possession. Had his \nmarijuana use ended there, this incident would not be a security concern. However, his \nuse continued for the next 33 years. For the past twenty years he has been using \nmarijuana once or twice a year. When asked if he would use in the future, he said he \nwould if it were offered and the occasion conducive. Applicant still fails to understand \nhis use of marijuana is illegal, inappropriate, and incompatible with holding a clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the drug involvement security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Furthermore, he falsified his security clearance application. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) or Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86 Format) on June 15, \n2007. On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOctober 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on August 6, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 3, \n2008. The Notice of Hearing was issued on September 17, 2008, convening a hearing \non October 9, 2008. At the hearing, the Government presented five exhibits, marked GE \n1-5. GEs 1, and 3 - 5, were admitted without objection. Applicant objected to GE 2 and I \nexcluded the exhibit (Tr. 32).2 Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented no \nwitnesses or documents. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 17, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, with \nexplanations. He denied, however, that the alleged criminal charges were valid. \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant admitted he provided incorrect information in his \nanswers to e-QIP section 23. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old computer hardware technician working for a \ngovernment contractor. He has never been married and has no children. He graduated \nfrom college in December 2006, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in \ncomputer information systems (Tr. 5). He intends to pursue a master\u2019s degree in \ncomputer science. \n \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Abduction and \nKidnapping (both felony charges) of his then girlfriend; Assault and Battery on his \ngirlfriend, and Petit Larceny.  \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that during his last year in college, he shared an apartment \nwith his girlfriend (Tr. 49-51). In October 2006, he invited some of his relatives to stay \nwith them during a homecoming football game weekend. His girlfriend disapproved \nbecause she was not consulted ahead of time and they became involved in a verbal \nargument. During the argument, Applicant told his girlfriend he was leaving her. \nAccording to Applicant, his girlfriend lost it and began hitting him. To defend himself, he \nhad to restrain her for some time until he was able to leave the apartment. The \nneighbors heard the commotion and called the police department. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend \naccused him of blocking and preventing her from leaving her apartment. This allegation \nlet to the abduction and kidnapping charges. She also accused him of assault and \nbattery, and with stealing money from her.  \n \n \n \nAfter leaving his apartment, Applicant was stopped by a police officer, placed \nunder arrest, and transported to a magistrate. At the magistrate\u2019s office, Applicant used \nabusive language and made some improper comments (Tr. 72). He was arrested and \n \n2  GE 2 is a report of investigation summarizing Applicant\u2019s interview conducted by a Government \ninvestigator in July 31, 2007. I excluded it pursuant to Directive, Enclosure 3, Additional Procedural \nGuidance. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                     \nplaced in jail for four days pending bail (Tr. 100). Applicant was assigned a court-\nappointed attorney to assist him with his criminal defense representation (Tr. 88). \n \n \nApplicant denied he ever assaulted his girlfriend. He claimed he had to restrain \nher for some time to prevent her from hitting him. He denied he prevented her from \nleaving their apartment. He claimed he was trying to enter the apartment to retrieve his \ncar keys and leave and she kept blocking and preventing him from entering the \napartment (Tr. 52-57). \n \n \n \nSeveral days after his release from jail, Applicant confronted his girlfriend about \nthe charges she filed against him. They became involved in another verbal argument \nand he lost his temper. He took her car keys from her and threw the keys away. He also \nbroke her car\u2019s side mirror and the windshield. Additionally, he used abusive language \nagainst her. On November 27, 2006, Applicant appeared in court to address the initial \nset of charges filed against him in early October 2006 (Tr. 86). At the arraignment, \nApplicant was served with the following additional charges resulting from his second \naltercation: Petit Larceny Under $200, Destruction of Property of a Value Under $1,000, \nand Abusive Language to Another (Tr. 102). \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s trial was scheduled for January 22, 2007 (Tr. 88-91). With the \nassistance of his court appointed attorney, Applicant entered into a pre-trial agreement. \nHe pled Nolo Contendere to the assault and battery charge. Applicant was required to \nmake restitution, to pay a fine, to attend a five week anger management counseling, to \nperform 40 hours community service, and to serve two years probation. The disposition \nof the assault and battery charge was deferred until February 2009 (Tr. 92). Pursuant to \nthe pre-trial agreement, all the remaining charges against him were Nolle Prossed.  \n \n \n \nApplicant believes that if he complies with all the conditions imposed by the court \nand stays out of trouble, all the charges against him, including the assault and battery \ncharge, will be dismissed and/or set aside. As of his hearing day, Applicant was serving \nprobation waiting for the final disposition of the assault and battery charge scheduled for \nFebruary 2009. \n \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. In his \nresponse to Section 23.a,3 Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question of whether he had \never been charged with or convicted of any felony offense. He deliberately failed to \ndisclose his October 2006 charges of Abduction and Kidnapping, both felony charges. \nIn response to Section 23.c, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the questions of whether there \nwere currently any charges pending against him for any criminal offenses. He \ndeliberately failed to disclose he is pending the adjudication of the Assault and Battery \ncharge scheduled for February 2009. Question 23.f asked whether in the last seven \nyears Applicant had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not \n \n3  Section 23 of the security clearance application reads in its pertinent part as follow: \u201cSection 23: \nYour Police Record.  For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has \nbeen sealed or otherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception to this requirement is for \ncertain conviction under the Federal Control Substances Act for which the court issued and expungement \norder under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                     \nlisted in response to other questions in the security clearance application. Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose his October 2006 arrest and charges of Abduction \nand Kidnapping (both felony charges), Assault and Battery, and Petit Larceny. He also \nfailed to disclose his November 2006 charges of Petit Larceny, Destruction of Property \nless than $1,000, and Abusive Language to Another. \n \n \n \nApplicant explained he failed to disclose his arrest and the charges for several \nreasons: (1) he was unfamiliar with the application and did not fully understand the \nquestions (Answer, Tr. 97); (2) he believed the charges were dismissed (Nolle Process), \nand as such, the questions did not apply to him (Answer), and (3) his girlfriend admitted \nthe charges were false and they were dropped (Tr. 39-41, 96); (4) the assault and \nbattery charge was to be set aside and removed from his records in February 2009 (Tr. \n111); (5) he did not know the abduction and kidnapping charges were felony charges \n(Tr. 95); (6) he had not seen his criminal record and did not know the charges would \nshow up (Tr. 98); and (7) he did not read the questions (Tr. 101).  \n \n \n \nIn mitigation, Applicant asserted that although he mistakenly failed to disclose his \narrest and charges, he corrected his mistake by being candid and forthcoming with a \nGovernment investigator during an interview conducted after he submitted his security \nclearance application. Applicant was called for a follow-up interview with a Government \ninvestigator in July 2007. Applicant did not request the interview. During the interview, \nthe investigator confronted Applicant with the undisclosed arrest and charges.  \n \n \n \nApplicant has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since \nApril 2007. He has performed well and has received no complaints from his supervisors \nor customers. There is no evidence he has ever compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. Outside of the arrest and charges involved in this \nSOR, Applicant has never been arrested, charged or convicted of any offenses. He has \nbeen involved in community and volunteer work with his fraternity and church. Applicant \nexpressed remorse for his questionable behavior and lack of judgment. He averred he \nhas matured and now understands the serious consequences of his actions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.4 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The \nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, \nwhich are to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n \n4  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d5 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \n \n5  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nApplicant was 22 years old and had almost completed four years of college when \nhe was involved in two altercations with his girlfriend. As a result of the first altercation \nhe was arrested and charged with Abduction and Kidnapping (both felony charges), \nAssault and Battery, and Petit Larceny. After the second altercation he was charged \nwith Petit Larceny Under $200, Destruction of Property of a Value Under $1,000, and \nAbusive Language to Another. He pled Nolo Contendere to the Assault and Battery \ncharge. The disposition of the Assault and Battery charge was deferred until February \n2009. He was placed on probation pending the disposition of the Assault and Battery \ncharge. All of the remaining charges were Nolle Prossed.  \n \n \nFurthermore, Applicant falsified his security clearance application when he failed \nto disclose he was arrested and charged with the above charges in 2006. His \nfalsification of the security clearance application is material and a violation of 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1001. Making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony \n(the maximum potential sentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 \nfine).6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s overall behavior raises security concerns under Criminal Conduct \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(d) \n\u201cindividual is currently on probation or parole or probation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s recent \nfalsification brings to the forefront the criminal conduct concerns raised by his past \nbehavior. The Government did not allege the falsification under Guideline J. Thus, the \nfalsification of the security clearance cannot be used as grounds to deny Applicant\u2019s \napplication under Guideline J. However, I am required to consider Applicant\u2019s overall \nquestionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged in the \nSOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his behavior is recent; the \nlikelihood of recurrence; Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning the circumstances of the \nincidents alleged; and his rehabilitation.7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that \nnone apply. Applicant\u2019s arrest and charges are recent. He is serving probation and \npending the adjudication of the assault and battery charge. Applicant receives some \n \n6  It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or \nfraudulent statement or representation, or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the \njurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Security clearances are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. See Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 527. The SOR does not allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 as criminal conduct, and I have not \nbased my determination on the applicability of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  \n7  ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncredit in mitigation because he expressed remorse for his past behavior, attended anger \nmanagement counseling, participated in community work, is doing well during his \nprobation, and he has a good employment record working for a defense contractor.  \n \n \nSeveral factors weigh against mitigation including the nature and seriousness of \nthe offenses, his age, education, and the fact that he is still on probation. Other factors \ntend to mitigate concerns such as the passage of time, his counseling, ongoing \nrehabilitation, expressed remorse, and good job performance. The positive factors are \ninsufficient to mitigate his criminal behavior. Applicant\u2019s overall behavior casts serious \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules and \nregulations.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. AG \u00b6 15. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose relevant information in his answers to Section 23 of \nhis security clearance application. Considering the record as a whole, I am convinced \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose the information. Numerous factors weighed in \nmy analysis to reach that conclusion, including: Applicant\u2019s age, his level of education, \nand his demeanor and testimony.  \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s excuses for his failure to disclose the information not credible. \nSection 23 of the security clearance application is written in plain, simple English \nlanguage. Applicant is a college graduate and is an articulate and bright person. He \nprovided extensive explanations minimizing his actions on the events that let to his \narrest and the filing of charges against him. He completed the security clearance \napplication in June 2007, only five months after his criminal trial hearing in which all but \none of the charges against him were Nolle Prossed. At the time he completed the \napplication, he was serving probation and pending the adjudication of his Assault and \nBattery charge, which was scheduled for disposition in February 2009. He knew that it \nwould not be until his February 2009 trial when all charges against him would be \n\u201ccompletely removed\u201d from his record (Answer, 3rd paragraph). \n \nApplicant knew or should have known the importance of accurate completion of \nhis security clearance application, and nevertheless failed to provide information that \nwas material to making an informed security decision. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 \n16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire,\u201d applies. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered all Guideline E mitigating conditions and conclude that none apply. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification is recent, and his favorable information is not sufficient to apply \nany of the mitigating conditions. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17.a: \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts,\u201d and find it does not apply. A Government \ninvestigator arranged for the interview and confronted Applicant with the undisclosed \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s evidence failed to establish he disclosed his arrest and charges \nbefore confrontation. Applicant\u2019s omission was not caused by improper advice of legal \ncounsel advising him concerning the security clearance process, thus, AG \u00b6 17.b, does \nnot apply. I do not consider Applicant\u2019s falsification a minor offense, and it is temporally \nrecent, AG \u00b6 17.c, does not apply. Additionally, for the same reasons outlined under the \ndiscussion of Guidelines J, incorporated herein, I conclude Applicant\u2019s behavior shows \nquestionable judgment, lack of reliability, and untrustworthiness. Finally, Applicant was \nunable to candidly admit the falsification at his hearing. He attempted to rationalize and \nminimize his falsification. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, \neducation, maturity level, both at the time of each incident of misconduct and at the time \nof his hearing. I considered his good performance for a defense contractor. I considered \nthat he is doing well on his probation, and in his rehabilitation efforts. On balance, the \nrecord evidence does not convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \ncriminal conduct and personal conduct concerns.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nDecember 10, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on July 12, 2007.  On June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines H and E for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 12, 2008.  He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 18, 2008, and subsequently requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request soon thereafter, and I received the\ncase assignment on August 25, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on that same\nday, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 11, 2008.  The\n\n2\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 and 2, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibit A, without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (TR) on September 19, 2008.  I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until September 25, 2008, to submit\nadditional matters.  On September 23, 2007, he submitted Exhibit B, without objection.\nThe record closed on that same day.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.c. of the SOR, and Subparagraph 2.a., of the SOR, as it relates\nto Subparagraphs 1.a.~1.c., without any explanations.\nThe Applicant is 22 years of age, and a recent, June 2008, college graduate (TR\nat page 18 line 23 to page 21 line 11).  He was very active in college, and a member of\na college fraternity (Id).  He has recently started \u201can in home personal training service;\u201d\nand as such, is very concerned about his health (TR at page 18 line 23 to page 21 line\n11).\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement & Guideline E - Personal Conduct\n1.a.~1.c., and 2.a.  The Applicant has smoked marijuana, at most, about 50\ntimes (TR at page 27 line 7 to page 28 line 19).  While attending college, from\nSeptember of 2004 until September of 2007, the Applicant smoked marijuana at his\ncollege fraternity between 10~20 times (Id, and GX 1 at page 10, and AppX A at page\n1).  He last used the drug in that setting in September of 2007, when \u201ca couple of guys\nwere watching TV and . . . [he] was sitting there and somebody passed it around and . .\n. [he] took a puff or two . . .\u201d (TR at page 44 line 18 to page 45 line 5).\nThe Applicant also contributed to the purchase of marijuana 5~10 times, the last\ntime being concurrent with his penultimate usage, sometime in 2006 (TR at page 43 line\n18 to page 44 line 12).  Again, in a fraternity setting, he \u201cwould throw $5 on the table for\nwhoever got it. . . . [He] never purchased it from a drug dealer . . .\u201d (TR at page 34 line\n23 to page 35 line 22).\nThe Applicant executed his e-QIP in July of 2007 (GX 1).  He thus used\nmarijuana once after executing this questionnaire, but prior to obtaining a security\nclearance (TR at page 40 lines 1~23, and at page 44 line 18 to page 45 line 5).  At his\nhearing, he averred that he intended no future drug involvement (TR at page 35 lines\n20~25).  Subsequent to his hearing, Applicant signed a statement of intent, vowing to\n\u201c[d]isassociate from drug using affiliates,\u201d and \u201cto never buy, use, sell or manufacture\nany drugs in the future\u201d (AppX B).  He further acknowledged that, by signing this\nstatement, any future drug involvement would result in any clearance he may hold being\n\u201crevoked\u201d (Id).\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nParagraph 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe guideline also notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.\nUnder Subparagraph 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying.  As is the\n\u201cpurchase\u201d of illegal drugs under Subparagraph 25(c).  Here the Applicant used\nmarijuana about 50 times, with his last usage being about a year prior to his hearing.\nThis is countered, however, by the mitigating condition found in Subparagraph 26(a).\nThe Applicant\u2019s Drug Involvement \u201chappened under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Here, the Applicant has graduated from college,\nand has left the attitude of complacency about marijuana of his college fraternity.\nSubparagraph 26(b) is also applicable, as Applicant has shown \u201ca demonstrated intent\nnot to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG Paragraph 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under\nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment . . . .  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d  Here, the Applicant used\nan illegal substance, marijuana, about 50 times, and used it once after executing his e-\nQIP.  However, this is countered by Subparagraph 17(c) as \u201cit happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Again, the Applicant\nhas graduated from college, and has left the attitude of complacency about marijuana of\n\n5\nhis college fraternity.  Furthermore, the Applicant has formally and credibly eschewed\nany future drug involvement.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his Drug Involvement and related Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The\n1\nSOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on October 3, 2008. She\nadmitted all SOR allegations and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 27, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued\non October 28, 2008, scheduling the hearing for November 17, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 12, 2009\n\n2\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4 and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified and submitted twelve documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant Exhibits (AE) 1-12 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript\nwas received on December 1, 2008.      \nProcedural Matters\nPrior to taking evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by striking\nsubparagraph 1.k based on it being a duplicate of the allegation contained in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.j. The amendment was allowed without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 34-year-old woman who has been employed as a beneficiary service\nrepresentative by a defense contractor since October 2006. She performed the same type\nwork for a different employer from March 2000 until October 2006. She worked in a\nhospital as mental health technician from April 1998 until March 2000. Applicant is able to\nwalk to her present job. She chose to change jobs and accept her current employment to\nsave money by eliminating the expense of commuting. Applicant submitted letters of\nrecommendation from her supervisors at all three of the above employers. (AE 1-4) Those\nletters establish she has consistently been a dedicated, hard-working and valued employee\nwho has earned a reputation for honesty, integrity and trustworthiness.\nApplicant obtained a GED in August 1997. She thereafter attended a community\ncollege and a university and is about 20 credit hours short from receiving a bachelor of arts\ndegree. She last attended the university in 2003. She earned a certificate from massage\nschool in December 2005. \n    \nApplicant has never been married but has had an ongoing relationship with a man\nfor the past 18 years. She has a 17-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son from this\nrelationship. She had a third child from the relationship who died in or about December\n1995 when the child was about two years old. Applicant has lived on and off with this man\nduring the course of their relationship, but has periodically had to obtain orders of\nprotection against him due to domestic violence. The last order of protection was taken out\nin 2006. They are currently residing together.\nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent accounts that have been submitted for collection,\ntotaling $48,413. Four additional accounts are alleged in the SOR that had been charged\noff as bad debts, totaling $30,698. Seven of the delinquent accounts, totaling $71,502,\nrepresent unpaid student loans or tuition. The other delinquent accounts include credit\ncard, telephone, and medical bills that have remained unpaid for at least several years. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.f through 1.j, totaling\n$22,535.10, are subject to a wage garnishment order that has been in effect since May\n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n2\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n3\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n4\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n5\n3\n2007 (AE 11). Applicant\u2019s annual gross salary is $33,000 (AE 12), and, as of November\n2008, $153.64 per pay period is being withheld from her wages to satisfy the wage\ngarnishment order (AE 12). The loans covered by the withholding order are subject to an\nannual interest rate of 7.14% with the daily interest charge being $4.12 (AE 11). Applicant\nhas not made any payment on any of the other delinquent accounts listed in the SOR since\nthe spring of 2005 (Tr. pp. 35-36).\nApplicant attributes her financial problems to the purchase of her house and her\nfollowing directions provided to her by the man with whom she has had the long-term\nrelationship. She obtained the student loans at his insistence and he squandered much,\nif not all, the money she received on himself. She acquired the credit card debt and other\nexpenses also at his urging. In 2005, Applicant obtained a mortgage loan to purchase a\nhome knowing she was financially unqualified to obtain the loan due to the overwhelming\ndebt she owed on her outstanding student loans.\nApplicant\u2019s net biweekly pay is $709.91 (AE 12). Her mortgage payment is $633 a\nmonth (Tr. p. 27) and her car payment is $453 a month (Tr. p. 28). Her male companion\nis currently employed and provides some limited financial assistance to Applicant and her\nchildren, such as paying the electricity bill. However, he has only worked about four years\nout of the 18 years they have been together. He also handles all the household expenses,\nso she does not actually know what is or is not being paid.\nApplicant contacted an attorney about filing for bankruptcy protection in July 2006,\nand gave him a down payment in the amount of $325 (AE 8). She completed the required\npre-filing counseling (AE 9) but has not further pursued the matter. She does not have any\ncurrent plan for resolving her financial problems other than to possibly seek a part-time job.\n  \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n2\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.3\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n4\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.5\n\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n6\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n4\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The Administrative Judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.6\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n7\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n8\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nAs alleged in the SOR, Applicant has 17 delinquent accounts, totaling $79,111, that\nhave either been submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts. Five of those\naccounts, totaling $22,535.10, are subject to a wage garnishment order that is being\nsatisfied by the seizure of $153.64 a payday from Applicant\u2019s wages. No payment has\nbeen made on any of the other delinquent accounts for almost four years. Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history\nof not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is about $1,500. Her mortgage and car payments\nalone total almost $1,100. She currently receives some financial assistance from her male\ncompanion, who she periodically has had to obtain orders of protection against, but doesn\u2019t\nknow what he actually contributes to the household or what family expenses are actually\nbeing paid by him. Applicant purchased a house knowing she was financially unqualified\nfor the mortgage loan she obtained due to her outstanding student loans. She acquired\n\n5\nstudent loans to finance her male companions desire to splurge on himself. She has\nthousands of dollars in delinquent credit card and other debt that she cannot even begin\nto satisfy. DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or\nother financial analysis applies.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are long standing and unresolved. They were caused\nby her following the unwise and self-motivated advise of her male companion and her\ndecision to purchase a house knowing she was financially unqualified for the loan she\nobtained. She has done virtually nothing to resolve any of her debts and has no plan or\nprospect to attain a financially secure and responsible lifestyle. I have considered all\nmitigating conditions and conclude that none apply. \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nher acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nfinancial considerations security concerns. She has not overcome the case against her nor\nsatisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraphs 1.l-r:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Timothy W. Shaw, Esquire \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on February 16,\n2007. On November 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under criminal\nconduct (Guideline J) and excessive alcohol consumption (Guideline G). The action was\ntaken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant provided his answer to the SOR on December 8, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on March 3, 2009, and the hearing was held on March 25, 2009. At the\nhearing, 11 government exhibits (GE 1 through 11) were admitted in evidence without\nobjection to support the Government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and submitted 10\nexhibits (AE A through AE J) in support of his case. DOHA received a copy of the\ntranscript (Tr.) of the proceedings on April 9, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\nJune 15, 2009\n\n The date January 31, 2007 appears (1) on the first page of the offense report, on the third page under the\n1\ncase status section, on the fourth page under the offense status section, on the fifth page in section titled\nprobable cause affidavit, on the sixth page in the breath test operator permit affidavit, and in the refusal to\nsubmit to a breath test form (seventh page of the exhibit). \n Applicant testified the officer had videotape evidence that he never produced (Tr. 132).\n2\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nRulings on Procedure\nSubparagraph 1.a. incorrectly identifies January 25, 2007 as the date the\nalcohol-related driving offense occurred. GE 6 clearly shows the offense occurred on\nJanuary 31, 2007.  Hence, the date that appears in the subparagraph is hereby\n1\nchanged to January 31, 2007 to conform the allegation in the SOR to the evidence\npresented. See, E.3.1.17. of the Directive. \nFindings of Fact\nParagraph 1 of the SOR alleges five criminal conduct allegations. In response to\neach allegation, Applicant admitted he was arrested. In response to SOR 1.a., he\nindicated, and the records reflect, the case was dismissed. Concerning the remaining\nallegations, Applicant neither admitted nor denied the substantive offense, but stated\nthat the evidence shows successful rehabilitation. Under paragraph 2 of the SOR,\nApplicant indicated that SOR 1.a., 1.d., and 1.e. have unusual circumstances.\nFurthermore, the behavior is unlikely to recur based on the passage of time and the\ninfrequency of the conduct. In addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the\nSOR, I make the following factual findings. \nApplicant is 46 years old and married. He has two children from a previous\nmarriage,  and his current wife has two children from a previous marriage. Applicant\nretired from the United States Air Force in 2003 with an honorable discharge after 20\nyears of service. \nCriminal Conduct\nOn January 25, 2007 (SOR 1.a.), Applicant was arrested for driving while under\nthe influence of alcohol (DUI), and refusal to submit to a test for alcohol. He admitted to\nthe arresting officer he had consumed two or three beers (GE 2). He contested the\nobservations of the officer about having trouble keeping his balance (Id.). Also,\nApplicant requested video evidence to support the officer\u2019s claim he crossed the yellow\nline (Tr. 144; GE 3), but Applicant never saw video evidence (GE 2).  Applicant declined\n2\nto take a breath test, \u201cBecause I thought I had a better chance by going to 12 peers and\nfor them to judge whether it was a legal stop or not.\u201d (Tr. 142-143) After the case was\nscheduled for hearing several times, the matter was dismissed when the police officer\n\n The refusal of Applicant\u2019s wife to answer questions concerning the officer\u2019s statement, coupled with her\n3\nnervous demeanor while she testified (Tr. 82), reduces the believability of her testimony concerning the\ndomestic violence offense on September 24, 2006. \n3\ndid not appear for the hearing (GE 6). A no prosecution order was issued on April 23,\n2007 (AE I). \nApplicant was arrested on October 11, 2006 (SOR 1.b.) for a battery domestic\nviolence offense that occurred on September 24, 2006 (GE 7). In GE 3, Applicant noted\nhe and his soon-to-be wife became involved in an argument over a business they\noperated. Applicant testified he had not been drinking before the incident. (Id.; Tr. 128)\nHe believed his wife had been drinking, though he did not know how much (Id.). He\nclaimed he did not strike her. (Tr. 129). \nApplicant\u2019s wife  testified that on September 24, 2006 (SOR 1.b.) she and\nApplicant got involved in a scuffle by grabbing each other (Tr. 62). She testified she had\nconsumed a large amount of alcohol, but he had not consumed any alcohol before the\nincident (Tr. 60). The police were called. Applicant\u2019s wife indicated repeatedly to the\npolice she did not want to file charges (Tr. 59-63). \nThere is information in the incident report (SOR 1.b., GE 7) that the children of\nApplicant\u2019s then-girlfriend indicated they saw Applicant punching her, and that the\narresting officer noticed marks on his wife\u2019s neck and face (Id.). Applicant\u2019s wife testified\nshe punched herself in the eye (Tr. 64), resulting in the marks that appear in her picture\non the first page of GE 7. Applicant\u2019s wife could recall no scuffles with Applicant before\nor since the encounter in September 2006 (Tr. 65).  \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant\u2019s wife was asked to provide information\nabout the police officer\u2019s investigative statement (GE 7) concerning witnesses in the\ndomestic violence of September 2006 (SOR 1.b.), and the statement\u2019s reference to a\nlocation where Applicant might be found. After acknowledging she had read the\nstatement, she denied she provided the information in the statement. She stated she\nwould not answer the question regarding the location identified in the statement or a\nlocation where Applicant frequented (Tr. 76-77).  \n3\nReturning to the procedural path of SOR 1.b. through the court system, on\nJanuary 25, 2007, Applicant pled guilty to battery, domestic violence, and was\nsentenced to 12 months probation, ordered to pay $502 in court fines, and required to\nattend the Battery Intervention Program (BIP). \nThe BIP program cost about $1,100 for 29 classes, meeting once every Tuesday\n(GE 2; AE A). Applicant\u2019s licensed mental health counselor, qualified to testify as an\nexpert in the field of domestic violence treatment, but not in the field of alcohol treatment\n(Tr. 88-96), testified that Applicant successfully completed the BIP program (Tr. 98).\nThe 29 meetings consisted of three classes of initial assessment, 24 weeks of group\nsessions, a feedback session half way through the program, and a final\n\n4\nassessment/critique session (Tr. 97). The mental health counselor did not believe\nApplicant was likely to be involved in similar behavior in the future based on:\nHis participation [in the program], his insight that they have gained, just an\noverall feel for how they participate and share with other people, confront\nother people, on their behaviors. It\u2019s not one specific thing. It\u2019s just a lot of\npieces that I picked up during the 29 sessions (Tr. 100-101).\nThe mental health counselor also saw Applicant on March 9, and March 23,\n2009. The counselor conducted an evaluation of Applicant consisting of a personal\nhistory, records review, a clinical interview, and administration of two tests. The\ncounselor opined that nothing in the records precluded Applicant from holding a security\nclearance (AE A). In the 29 weeks of counseling, the counselor did not become aware\nof Applicant\u2019s April 2002 domestic violence offense (Tr. 107, 109).\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that after Applicant completed the BIP course in 2007,\nshe noticed a change in his behavior. According to his wife, when he gets angry to the\npoint of being upset, he knows how to talk about it (Tr. 71). \nOn April 28, 2002, Applicant was arrested for battery domestic violence (SOR\n1.c.). He was on active duty in the United States Air Force and had just returned from\nextended deployment (GE 3). The supporting documents reflect statements by the\nvictim his former wife alleging he grabbed her and threatened her. Applicant maintains\nthat his former wife was startled by his hug, and began to strike him (GE 3; Tr. 119).\nApplicant indicated he had not consumed any alcohol before the April 2002 domestic\nviolence (Tr. 156). He recalled pleading no contest to the charges. On June 7, 2002,\nApplicant received pre-trial diversion. He successfully completed a four-day anger\nmanagement course and a family advocacy course on the military installation (AE G; Tr.\n120). AE G also refers to completion of the BIP program on December 20, 2002,\nalthough there is no corresponding entry earlier in the journal record directing Applicant\nto enroll in the program. I consider the BIP reference an administrative error. \nOn March 12, 2001, Applicant was arrested for DUI (SOR 1.d.). He had been on\na long deployment and returned home after realizing his 17-year marriage was over.\nApplicant indicated he had two beers at a bar and one beer at a restaurant (Tr. 117-\n118). Shortly after leaving the restaurant, he was stopped by the police for weaving\nbetween the lines. Applicant does not believe he was weaving (GE 3). After four field\ntests conducted by the arresting officer, the officer placed Applicant under arrest (GE\n10). Applicant\u2019s refusal to take the breath test resulted in his license being suspended\nfor 18 months because it was the second time he refused. Applicant refused the test\nbecause it was his right to refuse, not because he was intoxicated (GE 3). He also\ntestified that:\nI refused on that particular incident because I thought that I would have a\nbetter chance in court of putting my evidence out and seeing what the\npolice officers had. There are a lot of police officers, in my opinion, in this\n\n5\ncountry that are overzealous and pull you over for any reason, especially if\nit\u2019s after midnight (Tr. 145-146).\nThe state amended the charge from DUI to reckless driving and Applicant pled\nno contest. He was found guilty of reckless driving and ordered to attend DUI\nawareness school. He also paid a fine of $533, and was placed on probation for 6\nmonths. He successfully completed DUI school, along with all other conditions, and was\ndischarged from probation on January 18, 2002 (AE J).\nBefore Applicant\u2019s July 1994 arrest for DUI, he had been on a fishing trip. He\nstated in GE 3 he drank two beers on the trip, and one beer while his fishing equipment\nwas being unloaded. He was stopped for DUI. The arresting officer told him he was\nstopped for erratic driving, but the police officer never explained to him what his erratic\ndriving was, nor did Applicant believe he was intoxicated (GE 3). His reasons for\nrefusing the breath test in 1994 were that he did not want to jeopardize his position and\nsecurity clearance in the military. He added:\n. . . I would have a better chance with a jury trial than just having an officer\npull me over with his observations conducting trial and jury and convicting\nme on the spot, when I believe that I wasn\u2019t guilty for, number one, the\nreason for the stop or number two, for the amount of alcohol that I\nconsumed (Tr. 147). \nThe DUI charge was reduced to reckless driving and Applicant was found guilty\nof the amended charge. He completed all conditions of his sentence that included a\nfine, DUI school and probation for 6 months. His license was also suspended for 6\nmonths for refusal to take the breath test (Tr. 142). \nAlcohol Consumption\nApplicant began consuming alcohol in 1983 when he entered the service. When\nhe was not on deployment, he occasionally consumed a 12-pack of beer on the\nweekends with friends and family (GE 3). After the alcohol-related offense in March\n2001, Applicant decreased his drinking to a 6-pack of beer over a weekend on\noccasion, and two or three beers on occasion. In June 2008, Applicant indicated he\nconsumed alcohol to relax and not to become intoxicated. He intended to drink in the\nfuture, but would no longer drink alcohol then drive a car (GE 3). Applicant testified he\nnever had blackouts, has never missed work, or lied about his drinking (Tr. 152). \nApplicant\u2019s wife believes Applicant\u2019s drinking changed after the incident in\nSeptember 2006 (Tr. 69). In her estimation, Applicant currently consumes alcohol about\nonce every six months (Tr. 70). Applicant testified that from January 2007 (SOR 1.e.)\nuntil the hearing, he consumed alcohol six months before the hearing, and also during\nthe professional football championship in January 2009. He believes he will probably\nremain abstinent in the future because of the security investigation (Tr. 138). With 20\nyears of service in the military and five years employment with a defense contractor, he\n\n6\ndid not think he would have to come to a hearing to explain his alcohol consumption\n(Id.).\nCharacter Evidence\nWitness A, who worked the day shift before he retired in 2008, testified he has\nknown Applicant since 1991, and worked with him daily as senior technician on the\nsame shift from 2005 to 2008. In 2005, Witness A recommended that Applicant be hired\nfor his position, and still believes he is trustworthy (Tr. 37). Applicant has shown no sign\nof alcohol use on the job. Witness A has seen Applicant at a bar (Tr. 36).\nWitness B has known Applicant since June 2004. While he has no contact with\nApplicant away from the job, he has never seen any sign of alcohol use by Applicant on\nthe job (Tr. 43-45).\nWitness C, lead supervisor of the day shift, hired Applicant in July 2004. He has\nnever smelled alcohol on Applicant (Tr. 48-49), and recommends him for a position of\ntrust (Tr. 48). Witnesses A and C recalled Applicant attending battery intervention\ncounseling in 2007 (Tr. 56).\nApplicant received recognition by the Air Force for his non-combat service\nbetween November 1991 and December 1996 (AE B). \nApplicant\u2019s personal record (AE C) reflects education at the non-commissioned\nacademy. The record also shows a Bachelors degree in astronautical engineering and\nan associate degree in systems technology. \nOn November 10, 1998, Applicant received recognition for spending 30\nconsecutive days at a location in the Middle East, in support of a military program (AE\nD). AE E, which shows Applicant\u2019s flying history, reflects that he compiled 925.2 hours\nof flight time behind enemy lines. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\n\n7\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\n\u00b6 30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nThe government has established a criminal case under the criminal conduct\nguideline. Between 1994 and January 2007, Applicant engaged in four criminal offenses\nby violating the traffic laws and/or breath test regulations, and the domestic violence\nstatute of the state. Significantly, Applicant\u2019s explanation for the two alcohol-related\noffenses in 1994 and 2001 is that he did nothing wrong. In the 2002 domestic violence\noffense, he claims the only action he took toward his former wife was to hug her. In the\nSeptember 2006 domestic violence offense, his only adverse conduct was a mutual\nscuffling where he and his current wife grabbed each other. CC disqualifying condition\n(DC) \u00b6 31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and CC DC \u00b6 31.c.\n(allegation of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted) apply. \n\n8\nThere are two of four mitigating conditions that potentially apply to the facts: CC\nmitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 32.a. (so much time has passed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and CC\nMC \u00b6 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ndevelopment).\nConsidering the evidence as a whole, CC MC \u00b6 32.a. does not apply because the\nsecond domestic violence offense, which occurred less that four years ago, represents\na pattern of criminal conduct that began in 1994. Applicant\u2019s explanation for each\noffense demonstrates minimization and denial of the full scope of his conduct in each\ncrime. Even though he completed all terms of his sentence, including the completion of\nthe BIP program in 2007, Applicant still believes he did nothing wrong. His position\ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe evidence of successful mitigation under CC MC \u00b6 32.d. comes from\nApplicant\u2019s completion of the BIP program. Likewise, Applicant\u2019s job performance\nevidence and academic accomplishments have been recognized. But, not enough time\nhas passed since the September 2006 offense. Applicant has not persuaded me he\naccepts full responsibility for his actions in the domestic violence behavior, and the\nother alcohol-related offenses, including the refusals to take breath tests for alcohol.\nThe opinion of the licensed mental health counselor (qualified to testify in domestic\nviolence course of treatment) that he did not believe Applicant was at risk to engage in\nthis kind of behavior in the future, would usually be entitled to considerable weight.\nHowever, the counselor\u2019s opinion is assigned less weight because he did not know\nApplicant had committed battery domestic violence in April 2002. Having weighed all the\nevidence, particularly his refusal to take the test for alcohol on three occasions between\n1994 and January 2007, the CC guideline is resolved against Applicant. \nAlcohol Consumption (AC)\n21. The Concern. \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nAC DC \u00b6 22.a. (alcohol-related incidents away from work regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies to\nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol-related offenses in 1994 and 2001. However, Applicant indicated\nthat he moderated his drinking after the 2001 offense. Though Applicant continued to\nconsume alcohol subsequent to the 2001 offense, there is no evidence he used alcohol\nin the domestic violence offenses of April 2002 and September 2006. Though he was\ncharged with DUI and admitted consuming two or three beers before his DUI arrest in\nJanuary 2007, the charges were dismissed when the arresting officer failed to appear\nfor the hearing. Accordingly, the documentation (except the documentation verifying\n\n9\nApplicant refused to take the breath test) supporting SOR 1.a. receives no weight.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s reduced use of alcohol since 2001, I employ AC MC \u00b6 23.a. (so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) to resolve the AC\nguideline in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \n\u00b6 2. The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a\nperson\u2019s life, and a careful consideration of nine variables that comprise whole person\nmodel:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation and recurrence. \u00b6 2, p.18 of\nthe Directive.\nHaving carefully weighed and balanced the adverse evidence with the favorable\nevidence, I find against Applicant under the criminal conduct guideline because I am not\npersuaded he accepts full responsibility for his alcohol-related behavior in 1994, 2001,\nand the domestic violence offenses in 2002 and 2006. The reason for breath tests and\nother field sobriety tests is a convincing public policy of keeping drunk drivers off the\nroad. Though an individual\u2019s refusal to take the breath test is his right, Applicant\u2019s\nrefusal is based on his claim that police officers are more inclined after midnight to stop\ndrivers for any reason. This position demonstrates poor judgment and a lack of respect\nfor regulations designed to promote public safety. \nI have carefully evaluated the commendations/awards/education Applicant has\nreceived during his 20-year career in the Air Force. His good job performance serves as\na basis for Witnesses A, B and C to recommend him for a position of trust. Having\nweighed the entire record with the testimony of Applicant and his witnesses, Applicant\nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the CC guideline. Conversely, the\nsupporting evidence from his wife regarding his decreased alcohol consumption\nestablishes a finding in his favor under AC guideline. \n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Alcohol consumption, Guideline G) \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action\nis based on Applicant\u2019s connections to China via his involvement with a company doing\nbusiness in China. These circumstances raised security concerns under the guidelines\nfor foreign preference and outside activities. Applicant mitigated the security concerns\nby resigning from the company, terminating his interests in the company, and pledging\nnot to travel to China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Accordingly, as explained in more detail\nbelow, this case is decided for Applicant. \nAugust 27, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibit 4; Tr. 29\u201330. \n2\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on April 7, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B for\nforeign influence and Guideline L for outside activities. The SOR also recommended\nsubmitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 27, 2009, and he requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 8, 2009. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nJuly 16, 2009. The testimony of Applicant was taken, and Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 4 were admitted. The record was kept open until July 31, 2009, to allow\nApplicant to submit documentary evidence. Those matters were timely received, and\nthey are marked and admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E. The hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) was received July 22, 2009. \nProcedural Matters\nAdministrative or official notice was taken of certain facts concerning the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (China) as set forth in Department Counsel\u2019s written\nrequest.  In summary, the most pertinent of those facts are as follows: (1) China has an\n2\nauthoritarian government that is dominated and controlled by the Chinese Communist\nParty; (2) China is actively engaged in intelligence gathering (industrial and military) that\ntargets U.S. information and technology; and (3) China has a poor record of human\nrights. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, which establish his connections to China\nvia a company doing business in China. For ease of understanding, it will be described\nas the Chinese company throughout this decision. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand I found his testimony credible in all respects. Based on the record as a whole, the\nfollowing facts are established by substantial evidence.\n\n Tr. 72. \n3\n Tr. 43\u201344. \n4\n Tr. 48. \n5\n Tr. 51\u201352. \n6\n Tr. 65\u201366.\n7\n3\nApplicant is a 49-year-old entrepreneur and self-employed business consultant.\nHis educational background includes an MBA, and he is also a certified public\naccountant. He has his own company and works in the areas of venture formation,\nprivate equity, and hedge funds. In his line of work, the formation of a new company\ntypically results in an equity ownership in the new enterprise.  He also serves as a\n3\ndirector of several companies and is paid a fee for his services. He described himself as\na \u201ctechnology guy\u201d with a background in telecommunications, encryption, compression,\nsatellites, and thermal imaging.  He is seeking an industrial security clearance for the\n4\nfirst time in connection with his business relationship with a defense-contractor\ncompany. He serves as a director on the defense-contractor company\u2019s board of\ndirectors, and it is this company that is sponsoring him for the clearance. \nThe Chinese company is a privately-held company with its headquarters or main\noffice in the U.S. The company is engaged in two lines of business: (1) buying and\nselling of raw materials for a renewable-energy product; and (2) manufacturing certain\nparts or components for a renewable-energy product. There is no overlap or\ncommonalities between the business lines of the Chinese company and the defense-\ncontractor company; the only commonality is Applicant\u2019s involvement in each.  Of\n5\nconcern here is a subsidiary of the Chinese company that is currently building the\nmanufacturing facility in China. \nApplicant has served as a director and chief financial officer for the Chinese\ncompany. He was a minority shareholder who held about 1.5% of the company\u2019s stock.\nThe chief executive officer (CEO), chairman, and founder of the Chinese company\nholds about 95% of the company\u2019s stock. The CEO is a U.S. citizen who has Chinese\nethnicity. The remaining 3.5% of shares of the company are held by a Chinese citizen\nwho is overseeing the manufacturing facility in China. Applicant described his\nrelationship with that gentleman as remote, as Applicant has never met him or spoke to\nhim on the telephone and could not recall his name at the hearing.   \n6\nApplicant received a large number of shares of stock (vested and unvested) in\nthe Chinese company in exchange for his services. He estimated the potential future\nvalue of his equity interest was in the seven-figure range.  Beginning in 2007, Applicant\n7\nsold shares of stock back to the company at the rate of $6,000 monthly for about nine\nmonths for a total of $54,000 in capital gains. He ceased selling the shares in about\nAugust 2008, when concerns were raised by written interrogatories that the Agency\n\n Tr. 53. \n8\n Tr. 52\u201353. \n9\n Exhibits A \u2013 E. \n10\n Exhibit D. \n11\n Exhibit C. \n12\n Exhibit E. \n13\n Department of Navy v.

Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n4\npropounded to him. He has received no compensation from the company since August\n2008, when he \u201ctruncated his relationship with the company.\u201d8\nApplicant\u2019s work for the Chinese company included a business trip to China in\n2007. During the trip, he met with local or municipal governmental officials. He\ndescribed his role as preparing the business plan, providing advice in the areas of\ncapital structure of the company, offering prices, corporate governance documents, and\nemployment agreements, and he helped obtain the necessary building permits.9\nApplicant fulfilled his responsibilities in this regard, he had no ongoing business role with\nthe manufacturing facility, and he had no ongoing contact with the Chinese\ngovernmental officials since concluding the trip.    \nApplicant has now resigned from the Chinese company, terminated his interests\nin the company, and pledged not to travel to China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and he\nhas advised the defense-contractor company of his actions.  First, he notified the CEO\n10\nof the Chinese company that he was resigning, effective July 16, 2009, as an employee,\nofficer, and director of the company.  Second, the three-page separation agreement\n11\nbetween Applicant and the Chinese company sets forth the terms of the separation. It\nspecifies, among other things, that Applicant will not receive any form of severance or\nseparation payment, and that he irrevocably surrendered all outstanding stock, stock\noptions, and warrants.  Third, Applicant agreed in writing not to travel for whatever\n12\npurpose to China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and he agreed to report any contact by a\nChinese national.  \n13\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n14\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\n\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n15\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n16\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n17\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n23\n5\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n15\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n16\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n17\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n18\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n19\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n20\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n21\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.22\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.23\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n24\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 6.  \n25\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 36. \n26\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 6\u20138 and \u00b6\u00b6 36\u201338 (setting forth the security concerns and all the disqualifying and\n27\nmitigating conditions). \n6\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n24\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nThe foreign influence and outside activities concerns are discussed together\nbecause the record shows the concerns are factually related or connected to each\nother. Under Guideline B, the concern is that an applicant\u2019s foreign connections may\nraise security concerns by creating divided loyalties or interests. The overall concern is\nthat:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.25\nLikewise, under Guideline L, the concern is that an applicant\u2019s outside employment or\nactivities may raise security concerns by creating a conflict of interest. The overall\nconcern is that:\nInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of\nsecurity concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s\nsecurity responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized\ndisclosure of classified information.26\nUnder the foreign influence and outside activities guidelines,  the following\n27\ndisqualifying conditions are raised by the record:\nContact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 7(a).\n28\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 7(e). \n29\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 37(a).\n30\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 8(b). \n31\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 38(b). \n32\n7\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion;28\nA substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country,\nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject\nthe individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation;  and \n29\nAny employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with: \n(1) the government of a foreign country; \n(2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity; \n(3) a representative of any foreign interest; and,\n(4) any foreign, domestic, or international organization or person engaged\nin analysis, discussion, or publication of material on intelligence, defense,\nforeign affairs, or protected technology.30\nThe guidelines also provide that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate\nthe concerns. The following mitigating conditions are raised by the record: \nThere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  and\n31\nThe individual terminated the employment or discontinued the activity\nupon being notified that it was in conflict with his or her security\nresponsibilities.32\nThe record contains substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s connections to China\nthrough his business activities with the Chinese company. This evidence raises security\nconcerns under both guidelines. The concerns are now resolved, however, by\nApplicant\u2019s affirmative actions. He wholly mitigated the concerns by resigning from the\nChinese company and terminating his interests in it. At this point, Applicant has no\nconnections to the Chinese company, and he has no other connections to China that\nare of concern. His actions were probably to his financial detriment given the potential\nfuture value of his equity interest in the Chinese company. But his actions demonstrate\n\n8\nhis true sense of loyalty or obligation is in favor of U.S. interests. And there is no conflict\nof interest between Applicant\u2019s business activities and his security responsibilities.\nApplicant has done everything he could do to mitigate the security concerns. \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines B and L. Applicant met his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline L:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.     \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \non (e-QIP), on September 16, 2005. On March 27, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 17, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on May 5, 2008, and I received the case assignment on May 8, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on May 14, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 11, 2008. \nOn June 5, 2008, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing rescheduling the \nhearing for June 24, 2008.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. The Government also submitted a List of Government \nExhibits, Exhibit (Ex.) I. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through O, \nwhich were received without objection, and testified on her own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until July 18, 2008 to afford the Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional documents. Applicant submitted AE P through AE II, which were \nforwarded to me without objection by Department Counsel by Memorandum, dated \nJuly 21, 2008 (Ex. II). DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 1, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., 1.n., 1.o., and \n1.p. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.j., 1.l., and 1.m. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old junior analyst, who has worked for a government \ncontractor since September 2004. GE 1, Tr. 17-18. Applicant stated she currently has \nan interim top secret, and has held a clearance since November 2001. GE 1, Tr. 16-\n17. Her continued employment is dependent on maintaining a security clearance. Tr. \n19-21. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1985. She estimates that she has \ncompleted 36 college credit hours. GE 1, Tr. 15-16. She was previously married from \nJanuary 1989 to August 1998. That marriage ended by divorce. Applicant remarried in \nMarch 2003. She has three children from her first marriage, an 18-year-old son, a 16-\nyear-old daughter, and a 14-year-old son. All three children reside with her and her \nsecond husband. She receives $452 per month in child support from her former \nhusband. GE 1, GE 2, Tr. 15-16. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded a review of her September 2005 e-QIP, March 2008 Response to \nInterrogatory with Attachments, and March 2008 and April 2007 credit reports. GE 1 \u2013 \n4. Allegations were delineated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.p., and are substantiated by \nApplicants admissions and documents submitted by the Government. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 16 separate line items to include a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy filed in September 1999 and dismissed in January 2000, and 14 separate \ndelinquent debts totaling over $16,000.  \n \nApplicant paid or otherwise resolved all of the debts alleged. SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a \n$1,370 judgment against Applicant, which has been paid in full. AE A. SOR \u00b6 1.b. is a \n$742 judgment against Applicant, which has been paid in full. AE B. SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a \n$750 collection account, which has been paid in full. AE C. SOR \u00b6 1.d. is a $222 \ncollection account, which has been paid in full. AE D. SOR \u00b6 1.e. is $332 collection \naccount, which has been paid in full. AE DD. SOR \u00b6 1.f. is a $346 collection account, \nwhich has been paid in full. AE DD, AE EE.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a $504 collection account, which has been paid in full. AE EE, AE \nHH. SOR \u00b6 1.h. is an $83 collection account, which has been paid in full. AE E. SOR \u00b6 \n1.i. is $8,783 collection account, for which Applicant has settled for $4,100, is making \npayments and is current. AE F, AE G. SOR \u00b6 1.j. is $50 past due account, which \nApplicant has paid in full. AE H. SOR \u00b6 1.k. is a $1,527 past due account, for which \nApplicant is making payments and is current. AE I.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. is a $385 collection account, which Applicant has settled for $192.50 \nand paid in full. AE GG. SOR \u00b6 1.m. is a $100 collection account, which Applicant has \npaid in full. AE K. SOR \u00b6 1.n. is a $1,295 collection account, for which Applicant is \nmaking payments and is current. AE L. SOR \u00b6 1.o. alleged Applicant is only making \npartial payments on her mortgage. She has since rectified that and is current. AE M. \nTr. 21-66, and AE Q apply to all SOR \u00b6\u00b6. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in approximately 1994 when she \nseparated from her first husband. She had custody of her three children and her \nformer husband was not paying child support. Around that time, she took a job with \nthe federal government and took an annual pay cut of approximately $13,000. \nOverwhelmed, she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1999, and simply did \nnot have the money to make monthly payments to the trustee. Tr. 65-70. Her \nbankruptcy was dismissed. (SOR \u00b6 1.p.) Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties continued. \nHer income deficiencies and lack of child support placed her in a financial tailspin. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s former husband is now paying child support, he remains $20,000 \nin arrears. Tr. 81-87 \n \nApplicant has remarried, obtained a better paying job, and learned to budget \nher finances better. She sought professional financial counseling since receiving her \nSOR, established a budget, and is well on the road to financial recovery. Her financial \nnet worth is $27,822. AE CC.  \n \nApplicant provided numerous reference letters from past and present \nemployers that support her good character and is a trustworthy individual. Her 2007 \nand 2008 work performance evaluations reflect above average performance. AE R \u2013 \nAE BB. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern is \nthat an Applicant\u2019s: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial considerations concerns were established by her \nadmissions and the Government\u2019s evidence. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties stem from \nher separation, divorce and underemployment beginning in 1994. She was faced with \nsupporting three minor children without child support. She sought Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection in 1999, but was unable to make the monthly payments to the \ntrustee and her financial difficulties continued until recently. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions listed under \nGuideline \u00b6 19, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d \nand \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nApplicant has paid or otherwise resolved all of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nShe has a better paying job, is receiving child support, and sought financial \ncounseling. Her financial house is in order, and her financial statement shows a \npositive net worth. In short, her financial situation has undergone a complete \nturnaround since she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy over nine years ago. She has \ndemonstrated she is a trustworthy individual by successfully maintaining a security \nclearance since 2001 and character evidence submitted.  \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude four of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 20 are applicable or \npartially applicable: \u00b6 20(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur an does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d \u00b6 20(b) \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's \n \n1 Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;\u201d \u00b6 20 (c) \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control;\u201d and \u00b6 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.p.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 22-year-old consultant who began employment with a federal contractor in May 2004. Applicant lists on his security clearance application (SCA) that he attended college from August 2003 to May 2007. Although he could have worked full time and also attended college, it is unlikely he could have completed college in four years while working full-time. It is likely he worked part-time or during the summers while attending college. He completed his SCA in September 2007, a few months after graduating from college. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in computer science.1 Applicant used marijuana on approximately 15 occasions from February 2006 to August 2007. Applicant provided little evidence regarding his drug abuse. In response to the FORM he stated his use was while he was attending college.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn January 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 21, 2008, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on March 13, 2008. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant on March 20, 2008, and it was received on March 28, 2008. \nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nApril 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and submitted an \nadditional statement. Department Counsel had no objection. The case was assigned to \nme on April 29, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the sole allegation in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 22-year-old consultant who began employment with a federal \ncontractor in May 2004.

It is likely he worked part-time or during the summers \nwhile attending college. He completed his SCA in September 2007, a few months after \ngraduating from college. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in computer \nscience.1  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on approximately 15 occasions from February 2006 to \nAugust 2007. Applicant provided little evidence regarding his drug abuse. In response to \nthe FORM he stated his use was while he was attending college. His last use was on \nAugust 10, 2007, and prior to then it was in April 2007. He stated in a written statement: \n\u201cThe August 10th event I consider to be a slip up on my part. After April I had intended to \nstop smoking and had done so successfully until August.\u201d2 When referring to the period \nbetween April and August 2007, he further stated: \u201cAlthough I might have been out of \nschool at this point, I still went down to the University of [State] on weekends for a few \nmonths after I graduated. This was because most of my friends still lived down at \nschool. The August 10th slip up occurred down at school while still in the college \nenvironment.\u201d3 He claimed the only time he smoked marijuana was when he was at \ncollege and with two people. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he did not plan on smoking marijuana ever again. He has \noffered to submit to random drug testing. He stated he has distanced himself from \ncollege. He stated: \u201cI do not go down there on weekends anymore as my close friends \nhave all graduated. Also, I have not hung out with any of my friends that smoked in \nquite a while. Due to these facts I have not even had the opportunity to smoke \nmarijuana since August 10th, 2007.\u201d4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Item 5. \n \n2 Response to FORM. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Id.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nOn his SCA, in response to his drug abuse, he stated: \u201cI do not intend on ever \ndoing Marijuana or any illegal drug for that matter again. There are many reasons for \nthis some of which include: [n]ot in college anymore, [l]egal penalties, I have a full time \njob now, and also my health. Marijuana also caused me anxiety which I do not desire to \nexperience again.\u201d5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n                                                          \n5 Item 5. \n\n \n4 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n25 and especially considered (a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d) and (c) (\u201cillegal drug possession, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or \npossession of drug paraphernalia\u201d). Applicant admitted he used marijuana from \nFebruary 2006 to August 2007. Obviously in order for him to use the drug he had to \npossess it. Therefore, I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 \nand especially considered (a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, \nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d), and (b) (\u201ca \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence;(4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\u201d). It is unclear whether \nApplicant was actually working for his employer when he was using drugs. Based on the \ndates he provided in his SCA it appears he was employed during this time, but he \nclearly discusses his use was during his college years. Even if he was still in college \nand not working during the majority of time he used drugs, it is clear that approximately \nsix weeks prior to completing his SCA he again used marijuana. Applicant\u2019s statements \nconcede his use was while attending or visiting his college. He comments that he \nslipped up and \u201chas not even had the opportunity to smoke marijuana since August 10th, \n2007.\u201d It has been a mere eight months since Applicant last used marijuana. Although \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhe may now be committed to abstinence, he admitted he failed at his first attempt. He \nappears to be taking appropriate steps to reinforce his renewed commitment to \nrefraining from drug use. He is working full-time. He has not associated with those he \nused drugs with in the past, at least since August 2007. He has not been back to his \ncollege since August 2007. In addition, he has signed a statement of intent not to use \nillegal drugs in the future. Therefore, I find that mitigating condition (b) partially applies.  \n \n \nThe length of time Applicant has abstained from using illegal drugs is less than \none year. Despite Applicant\u2019s promises to not use illegal drugs in the future, he admitted \nhe attempted to abstain in April 2007 and failed. He has abstained since August 2007. \nAt this juncture, it is too early to conclude Applicant\u2019s commitment to abstinence is \npermanent. I cannot find that his behavior happened so long ago, was infrequent or that \nunder the circumstances it is unlikely to recur. Consequently, I cannot find (a) applies.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 22 years old and a \nrecent college graduate. He used marijuana 15 times over a period of a year and a half \nleading up to his full time employment. He states he is committed to abstinence, but \nadmitted he has slipped up. Although his drug use could be described as \u201cyouthful \nindiscretion\u201d it is too soon to conclude he has put that period of his life behind him. \nWithout a significant period of sustained abstinence I am unable to conclude Applicant \nhas successfully mitigated the security concerns raised. Overall the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from drug involvement.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

On July 25, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 30, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason\n\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not correctly weigh Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Applicant argues that this evidence was\nsufficient to warrant favorable application of the mitigating conditions and whole person factors.\nIn support of his argument, Applicant submits new evidence in the form of documentary exhibits\nwhich the Board cannot consider on appeal.  See Directive E3.1.29.  Applicant has not demonstrated\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\noutstanding debts, and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing,\nthe Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to four of the SOR\nfactual allegations.   However, he reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on June 8, 2007.\nOn July 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on August 29, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on October 3, 2008 for a hearing on October 28, 2008. The hearing\nwas held as scheduled. At the hearing, five exhibits (GE 1 through 5) were admitted in\nevidence without objection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted four exhibits. (AE A through AE D) DOHA received a copy of the transcript of\nDecember 30, 2008\n\n The amount has increased substantially because of penalties and interest added to the principal debt.\n1\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nthe proceedings on November 6, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR has five allegations under the financial considerations. Though\nApplicant admitted all allegations, I find that he still owes SOR 1.b., whether the\ndelinquent account is or is not related to SOR 1.c. As shall be noted below, SOR 1.c. is\nfound in Applicant\u2019s favor because the allegation is too vague to give Applicant\nadequate notice of the specific financial concerns relating to delinquent debts, his\nmortgage company, and the ultimate foreclosure and sale of his home. See, SOR 1.c. \nApplicant is 42 years old, divorced, with five children. He is employed by a\ndefense contractor as an emergency responder. In this job, Applicant and other\nindividuals maintain a ready status to respond to manmade or natural disasters (Tr. 37).\nIf a disaster occurs, he would proceed to the location and establish temporary hospitals\nto handle the injured. Applicant served in the United States Army (USA) from 1987 to\nJanuary 2007. He seeks a secret clearance. \nBetween 2001 and early 2003, Applicant was about to be mobilized to a military\ninstallation with an expectation for deployment that did not occur. He transferred\nownership through a \u201cquick deed\u201d and a \u201cpower of attorney\u201d to a brokerage firm to sell\nhis apartment building containing three units (GE 2). According to Applicant, the\nbrokerage firm did not put the building\u2019s water utility (SOR 1.e.) in their name. When the\napartment building was foreclosed on, Applicant\u2019s name still appeared on the water\nutility bill. The mortgage company identified in SOR 1.c. owned Applicant\u2019s mortgage for\nhis apartment building (Tr. 47). When the building was foreclosed on around May 2007,\nthe subsequent sale of the home provided a profit sufficient to extinguish the mortgage\ndelinquency.\n\u2022 SOR 1.a., $29,861.00.  This account was reported delinquent in May 2007 (GE\n1\n5). Applicant believes this account was for a credit card his former wife used to pay for\nhousehold items; he estimated the card became delinquent in 2006 or 2007 (Tr. 35).\nApplicant claims he made two or three months of payments (Tr. 21), or about nine\npayments because he was paying the creditor every week (Tr. 73), and the balance\nshould be lower than $18,000.00, rather than the posted amount in AE A. Applicant\nrecalled paying them $2,800.00 out of his checking account which temporarily reduced\nthe account to zero (Tr. 54-55). At a later point in his testimony, Applicant claimed he\nset up a payment allotment of $750.00 a month that is automatically taken out of his\nchecking account (Tr. 38). \nAE A contains four invoices dated: September 3, 2008, September 16, 2008,\nSeptember 30, 2008, and October 14, 2008. The balance listed on the most recent\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\ninvoice is $29,861.62. There is no documentation, i.e., bank statements, that would\nshow the frequency of payments to this collection agency, except for the four invoices\nthat show Applicant paid $1,400.00 to the collection agency. \n\u2022 SOR 1.b., $7,239.00. This account was first reported delinquent in January\n2007. Applicant initially claimed he had contacted the company who told him the debt\nhad been or would be removed from his credit report (Tr. 24-25). Based on discussion\nhe had with an adjudicator from DOHA, who suggested the debt may relate to the debt\nin SOR 1.c., Applicant testified the two debts could be related, but he really does not\nknow. He stated that he intended to find out whether he owes the account (Tr. 74).\n\u2022 SOR 1.c., $82,758.00. This amount appears in GE 3 as past due as of June\n2008. The allegation refers to other delinquent debts owed to the cited mortgage\ncompany, but does not identify what those debts are. After reviewing other record\nevidence exhibits (GE 3 and GE 4) and Applicant \u2019s testimony (Tr. 40-48), I am unable\nto determine what other debts the allegation is referring to, and how those other debts\nrelate to the mortgage company, leading to the foreclosure and ultimate sale of his\nhouse. Accordingly, I find the allegation is unclear because it does not provide\nreasonable notice of what is being alleged. This allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor. \n\u2022 SOR 1.d., $263.00. This account was first reported delinquent in June 2007.\nApplicant paid this creditor on October 23, 2008 (AE B). He also provided\ndocumentation he had paid the creditor in 2005 (GE 2). \n\u2022 SOR 1.e., $320.00. This account was first reported delinquent in October 2006.\nOn October 23, 2008, Applicant paid this creditor in full (AE C). As noted at the outset of\nthis section, this account originally belonged to Applicant but should have been\ntransferred and/or taken out of Applicant\u2019s name after the property had been foreclosed\n(GE 2).\n\u2022 SOR 1.f., child support. According to Applicant, execution of garnishment is an\nautomatic practice that State X imposes when it is determined that child support is owed\n(Tr. 51). Applicant maintains he never was delinquent in paying his child support (Tr. 29-\n31). Also, the two payment sources were paying the child support by mistake, and the\nadministrative error has been corrected (Tr. 52). GE 5 reveals that Applicant was\ncurrent on his child support. There is no entry identifying delinquent child support in GE\n3 or GE 4. The allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhen asked about whether he has a budget, Applicant responded in the\naffirmative and explained:\nYes, sir. Meaning that when the money come in, I know what has to be\npaid. It\u2019s like now it\u2019s pretty much set in stone, because [the bank] get their\nmoney, the child support get their money. I know to pay the - - where I\u2019m\n\n The only information appearing in Applicant\u2019s SCA (GE 1) is his length of military service and his rank. \n2\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nat now, and the rest is just to take care of the regular things around the\nhouse (Tr. 58).\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no evidence of military background,  or his job performance.\n2\nApplicant has only one mortgage on the house he is living in (Tr. 45), and his mortgage\nis current (GE 3). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nFC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply to SOR 1.a., 1.b.,\n1.d., and 1.e. the debts have been delinquent for about two years.  \nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances); FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control); and, FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Though there were\nfive delinquent debts at the time the SOR was issued in July 2008, Applicant paid two of\nthe smaller debts. Two other debts have been resolved in his favor. However, he still\nowes the SOR 1.a. and 1.b. accounts. Applicant has documented four payments\ntotaling $1,400.00 to the SOR 1.a. creditor. There are no records showing that he made\na $2,800.00 payment or that the balance of the debt is now $18,000.00. \nAfter initially claiming the SOR 1.b. creditor was going to remove the account\nfrom Applicant\u2019s credit report, then claiming the account was related to the SOR 1.c.\ncreditor, Applicant finally admitted he had taken no action regarding the 1.b. creditor.\nApplicant\u2019s equivocal testimony regarding the 1.a. and 1.b. creditors continues to cast\ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. FC MC 20.a. does not apply. \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nFC MC 20.b., which mitigates when unforeseen events impede an applicant\u2019s\nefforts to honor his current or delinquent financial obligations, is unavailable to\nApplicant. \nApplicant receives no mitigation under FC MC 20.c. because he has had no\ncounseling and there are no clear indications he has his financial difficulties under\ncontrol. While he has paid two small past due debts, he still owes about $36.000.00.\nThe mitigation Applicant receives under FC MC 20.d. for paying off the creditors\nidentified in SOR 1.a., 1.d., and 1.e. is reduced by the fact that he took no action on any\nof the debts until after he received the SOR in July 2008. In addition, he has undercut\nthe credibility of his efforts to repay the SOR 1.a. account with his unsupported claims\nthat he had been paying the account every week and that the balance should be less\nthan $18,000.00. Finally, the specious claims Applicant made about the SOR 1.b.\naccount before finally admitting he had taken no action on the debt, undermine his\ncredibility even more. On balance, without any evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial\npractices or character evidence regarding his job performance or lifestyle away from\nwork, Applicant\u2019s payoff of the creditors in 1.d. and 1.e. and his partial payment of the\nSOR 1.a. creditor does not sufficiently meet his burden of persuasion under the FC\nguideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FI guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nOne of the most important factors of the whole person concept is the sixth factor,\nor the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes. Because this\ncase presents financial issues, the action an applicant takes to repair his financial habits\nis just as important as actually paying past due bills. Applicant has provided no evidence\nof measures he has taken so his current financial trouble will not recur or persist in the\nfuture. Accordingly, under the ninth factor of the whole concept, I cannot confidently\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nconclude that Applicant with not have financial problems in the future. Considering this\ncase in light of the evidence as a whole, the FC guideline is resolved against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Under Guideline F, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his October 2007 e-QIP by denying any debts over 180 days delinquent within the past seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a) or currently over 90 days delinquent (SOR \u00b6 2.b).

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on October 16, 2007. On May 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\ndecision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative\njudge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 16, 2008. He answered the\nSOR allegations in writing on July 27, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing.\nOn August 22, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\nconsisting of ten exhibits (Items 1-10). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to\nApplicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. No response was\nreceived by the October 8, 2008, due date. On November 19, 2008, the case was\nJanuary 8, 2009\n\nApplicant did not provide the dates of his marriage and divorce on his e-QIP (Item 4).\n1\n2\nassigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for him. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s\nFORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 2), eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $44,229 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.l) following a November 2000\nbankruptcy discharge (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline F, personal conduct, Applicant was\nalleged to have deliberately falsified his October 2007 e-QIP by denying any debts over\n180 days delinquent within the past seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a) or currently over 90 days\ndelinquent (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted the Chapter 7 bankruptcy as well as the\ndebts, but indicated that the student loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was the same debt alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 1.d. In response to the personal conduct concerns, Applicant responded, \u201cI\nadmit but I needed to read question better.\u201d He added that he was seeking\nconsolidation of his outstanding debt (Item 2). After considering the evidence of record, I\nmake the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old divorced driver/mechanic with a 13 year old son.  He\n1\nhas been living and working in the Middle East since about October 2004. He has\nworked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since January 2005. The\navailable record does not show that he holds a security clearance (Item 4).\nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Army from 1995 to 2001\n(Item 7). While he was in the military, he fell behind in several financial obligations. On\nJuly 25, 2000, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, listing liabilities of $59,291, including\n$16,960 in secured debt, $16,000 of which was for a 1998 model-year vehicle. About\n$10,361 of the $42,331 in unsecured debt was for two student loans owed since the\nmid-1990s. He reported that his monthly expenses exceeded his monthly take home\npay by $132. On November 9, 2000, Applicant was granted a discharge of those debts\nlegally dischargeable, which did not include his student loans (Item 5).\nAfter he was honorably discharged from the Army, Applicant was unemployed\nuntil February 2002, when he started working as a driver for an aquarium (Item 4).\nAccording to his DD 214, he received disability severance pay of $21,333.60 for the\nperiod September 29, 1999, to September 28, 2002 (Item 7). In April 2004, he went to\nwork as a driver for a maid service/cleaning service. In September 2004, he began\noverseas employment in the Middle East as a mechanic with a defense contractor. In\nJanuary 2005, he began his present employment in a more stable country in the region\n(Item 4).\nIn application for a security clearance, Applicant executed an e-QIP on October\n16, 2007. He responded negatively to questions 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you\nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28.b, \u201cAre you currently over 90\n\nApplicant listed three student loan debts on his bankruptcy petition in the amounts of $851 opened\n2\nApril 1994, $5,240 opened June 1995, and $5,121 opened May 1996 (Item 5). Recent credit reports show one\noutstanding student loan account opened May 2005 (Items 6, 7) with a balance of $10,734 as if October 2007\n(Item 6).\n3\ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?,\u201d and indicated, \u201cI have not check[ed] my credit report\nin awhile.\u201d (Item 4).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on November 10, 2007, revealed several accounts\nhad been charged off and/or placed for collection since his bankruptcy.

It is unclear whether he pays her any money to care for his son. He earned\n$37,792.16 in gross wages during the first quarter of 2008 (Item 7). In response to\nDOHA\u2019s request to update the status of his past due accounts, Applicant provided an\nApril 10, 2008, credit report that showed he had made no progress toward resolving his\ndelinquent debts despite reported income and expense figures indicating he had a net\nmonthly remainder of between $4,700 (Item 7) and $4,966 (Item 8). He attributed his\nfinancial problems following his bankruptcy to issues with his divorce and custody of his\nson (Item 7). \n\n5\nAs of mid-July 2008, Applicant intended to satisfy his delinquent debts through a\ndebt consolidation plan (Item 2). He provided no evidence to indicate that he had\nentered into any consolidation agreement.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant was afforded a financial fresh start through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\ndischarge in November 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Although he left active duty in 2001, he was\npaid disability severance of $21,333.60, and he had earned income from civilian\nemployment since September 2002. He made no effort to satisfy his student loan (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, same debt) that survived the bankruptcy. In November 2000, he took\nout an automobile loan that was charged off in October 2002 with a balance over\n$10,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Over the 2003/04 time frame, he opened four credit card accounts\nthat were later charged off due to nonpayment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j). Power,\ntelephone, and cable bills went unpaid in recent years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l).\nSignificant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)). \nAG \u00b6 19(e) (\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis\u201d) applies to the period before his bankruptcy. He had\nincurred some $59,291 in liabilities when his annual income was less than $30,000.\nBased on the limited expense information available for recent years, AG \u00b6 19(e) would\nappear to no longer apply. As of 2008, he reported net discretionary funds each month\nin excess of $4,000, which suggests an unwillingness to satisfy debts (see AG \u00b6 19(a))\nrather than continued spending beyond his means.\nApplicant attributes his delinquent debt to his divorce and custody issues. While\ndivorce is potentially mitigating, he did not provide sufficient evidence to establish AG \u00b6\n20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d). There is no evidence that he pays any alimony to his ex-\nwife, or that he pays his sister to care for his son. He may well have incurred legal fees\nin a custody battle but I cannot speculate as to what impact that might have had on his\nfinances. Moreover, he appears to have the financial means to make payments on his\ndelinquent debts whether or not he qualifies for the foreign income tax credit. Even if he\nfailed to monitor his credit while living overseas, he knew as of April 2008 that DOHA\nwas concerned about his outstanding delinquent debts. Promises to pursue debt\nconsolidation are not enough to satisfy either AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is\n\n7\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control\u201d) or AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d). His inattention to his\nfinancial matters, especially after receipt of the SOR, continues to raise serious\nconcerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, \u00b6 15 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant responded negatively to the financial delinquency questions 28.a and\n28.b on his October 2007 e-QIP, when his past due balances totaled about $28,387.\nWhen first asked by DOHA about his failure to list his debts, Applicant responded in\nApril 2008, \u201cI had not got current credit report.\u201d (Item 7). Assuming he was unaware of\nthe status of some of his accounts, he must have known that he had defaulted on his\nstudent loans and that he had not paid them. They were listed on his bankruptcy petition\nand he has not denied the outstanding balance alleged other than to indicate that SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e pertain to the same debt. In response to DOHA\u2019s allegations that he\ndeliberately falsified his responses to questions 28.a and 28.b, Applicant did not claim\nthat he lacked knowledge of his debts, but rather that he had somehow erred in reading\nthe e-QIP (\u201cI needed to read [the] question better.\u201d Item 2). A reasonable inference of\nknowing and willful falsification is warranted, given the number of debts charged off\nand/or placed for collection, and his inconsistent explanations for the omission of\ndelinquent debts from his e-QIP. AG \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d) applies.\nAvailable mitigation shows that Applicant did not deny the delinquent debt when\nasked by DOHA to confirm the status of his past due accounts. He provided a credit\nreport showing that he had not satisfied his past due accounts as of April 2008.\nHowever, in the absence of any evidence that he brought the debts to the attention of\nthe government before he was asked about them, I am unable to conclude that he\nmade the prompt, good faith rectification required under AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts\u201d). Furthermore, in light of his inconsistent\nexplanations for failing to list any past due debts (i.e., unaware of the status of the debts\nvs. misread the questions on the e-QIP), AG 17(d) (\u201cthe individual has acknowledged\nthe behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive\n\n8\nsteps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy ,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d) also\ndoes not apply. Applicant has yet to admit that he put his interest ahead of his obligation\nto be fully candid about his finances.\n \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge\ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for\nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts\nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in\nthe SOR.\n\n9\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). In\nNovember 2000, most of his delinquent debts were discharged through bankruptcy. He\nmade no effort to repay his student loan debt that was not discharged, and he\nsubsequently fell behind on other financial accounts. While Applicant intends to seek\ndebt consolidation, there is no evidence of any payment arrangements with his\ncreditors, or with a debt consolidation firm to resolve the debts, despite available\ninformation showing he has the income to make payments. His lack of candor on his e-\nQIP about his indebtedness reflects an unacceptable tendency to act in self interest.\nDue to persistent concerns about Applicant\u2019s financial judgment and personal conduct, I\nam unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him\naccess to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant (Duplication of \u00b6 1.d)\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Dana D. Jacobson, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 1, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2008. Applicant \nwas working overseas, and was not scheduled to return to the United States until the \nlast week of December 2008. After coordinating with Department Counsel and \nApplicant\u2019s counsel, DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 19, 2008, and the \nFebruary 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing was convened as scheduled on January 6, 2009. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were received without objections. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf and submitted Exhibit (AE) A, which was received without objection. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit additional information. \nApplicant submitted six pages of documents, which were marked AE B through F, and \nadmitted without objections. Department Counsel\u2019s memos are marked Hearing Exhibits \n(HE) I and II. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He served in the U.S. Army from 1974 until he retired \nas a warrant officer in 1996. He has an MBA degree. He was married to the same \nwoman for 26 years, until they divorced in 2002. Applicant and his first wife remarried in \n2004. That marriage ended in divorce in 2006. He married his current wife in 2006. He \nhas three adult children from his first marriage and an infant child with his current wife.1  \n \n \nApplicant and his former wife had financial problems in the 1980s. She was also \nin the Army, but was discharged for passing nonsufficient funds (NSF) checks. She was \nunemployed and had a difficult time finding work. They filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \n1988. He was unable to maintain the payments to the trustee. The bankruptcy court \npermitted the case to be converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His dischargeable debts \nwere discharged on January 5, 1989.2  \n \n \nApplicant continued to have financial issues after the bankruptcy. He and his wife \nwent through a number of separations and then finally decided to go through with a \ndivorce. The separation agreement called for her to receive their house, and she would \nmaintain the mortgage payments. Their divorce was final in October 2002. She received \nthe house but did not keep up the payments on the mortgage. She planned to file for \nbankruptcy. He decided that if she filed bankruptcy and he did not, he would be solely \nresponsible for all their debts.3  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on August 1, 2002. Under \nSchedule D \u2013 Creditors Holding Secured Claims, he listed a mortgage and two equity \nloans on his house totaling $209,222, and a car loan with a balance of $13,198. \nSchedule F \u2013 Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims, listed 18 debts, totaling \n$67,428. He retained the car and reaffirmed the car loan. He filed that he would \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 22, 25, 31-32, 35-36, 44, 55-56; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 23-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2.  \n \n3 Tr. at 25-31. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nsurrender the house. The mortgage company filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to \npermit the company to proceed with foreclosure. The bankruptcy court permitted the \nforeclosure to proceed, and the house was lost to foreclosure. There is no deficiency \nowed on the mortgage. Applicant\u2019s dischargeable debts were discharged on November \n23, 2002.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment was sporadic. He had periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. He again fell behind on a mortgage, and lost his house to \nforeclosure in February 2007. There is no deficiency owed on the mortgage. His car \nwas also repossessed. The financial institution reported in July 2007, that the amount \ndue on the loan was $10,601, minus $3,500 obtained for the car at auction, plus $948 in \nattorneys\u2019 fees, for a balance of $8,050. Applicant settled this debt in full on January 26, \n2009, for $2,895.5 \n \n \nThe only other delinquent debt alleged in the SOR is a $20 debt to a collection \ncompany, collecting on behalf of a cable provider. The March 9, 2008 credit report listed \nthe original amount of the debt at $283, and a balance of $20. Applicant disputed owing \nthe debt, but paid the creditor to resolve the debt. The debt is listed on the December 9, \n2008 credit report with a zero balance.6 \n \n \nApplicant sought financial counseling from a credit counseling company. He also \nsought advice from financial planners. He obtained a job with a defense contractor in \nabout June 2007. He was deployed to Kuwait and Afghanistan in support of defense \ncontracts from about August 2007 through December 2008. Applicant was able to put \nhis finances in order and save money while he was deployed. He has no delinquent \ndebts, and he estimated that he has about $45,000 to $50,000 in his 401(k), cash, and \ncertificates of deposit (CDs), with about $30,000 of that amount in cash and CDs.7  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n                                                          \n4 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5.  \n \n5 Tr. at 33-39, 51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6-9; AE C, E, F.  \n \n6 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7, 8; AE A. \n \n7 Tr. at 39-43, 49-51, 54-57; GE 1. \n\n \n4 \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n5 \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems go back more than 20 years, and he only recently \npaid the last remaining delinquent debt. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. He attributed his \nfinancial problems to his former wife\u2019s actions and employment issues. These are \nconditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully applicable, there must be a \ncorrelation between the unforeseen circumstances and the person\u2019s financial problems. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant handled his financial issues by filing bankruptcy in 1988 and 2002. That is an \nacceptable legal option to address one\u2019s burdensome debts. However, Applicant does \n\n \n6 \n \nnot receive full credit under either AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d) for resolving his old debts \nthrough bankruptcy.8 To address his recent delinquent debts, Applicant obtained a job \nwith a defense contactor, and spent much of the last year and a half in Kuwait and \nAfghanistan. He built up a reserve of cash and other assets, and paid off all his \ndelinquent debts. He acted responsibly by making a good-faith effort to repay his \noverdue debts acquired since his last bankruptcy. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are applicable \nto his recent financial issues.  \n \nApplicant received financial counseling from a credit counseling company, and \nadvice from financial planners. He is now financially solvent, with a reserve of available \nassets. All his delinquent debts have been paid. His financial problems have been \nresolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n                                                          \n8 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No.  99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s service to \nthis country in the U.S. Army, and I also considered his deployments to Kuwait and \nAfghanistan as a defense contractor. His finances had been in disarray for a number of \nyears. However, he was able to save a substantial amount while he was deployed, and \nhe paid his remaining delinquent debts. His financial house is now in order.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one (SOR & 1.r) of the 22 allegations in the SOR relating to approximately $60,000 in delinquent debts. He denied the one personal conduct allegation (SOR & 2.a.). Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a government contractor working as an avionics technician since May 2006. He did similar work while on active duty as an E 6 in the Air Force for 14 years and for other defense contractors. He is married with two children, a son who is 20 and enlisting in the Marines and a daughter who is 18 living at home. Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2000 and it was discharged in February 2001 (SOR & 1.u. and v.). Most of the debts which were discharged arose from unsuccessful real estate investments. The principal sources of the delinquent debts alleged were from three auto repossessions totaling $45,000 (SOR && 1.l., 1.m., 1.o., and 1.p.), and medical bills for his daughter totaling $7,000 (SOR && 1.a-i.). There was an additional $2,000 of medical bills not alleged in the SOR which were paid. The remaining debts in the SOR were from a variety of sources such as cell phones and other consumer services. Although Applicant admitted all but one of the debts in his answer, at the hearing he questioned the validity of some and believed that one for insurance (SOR & 1.s.) had been paid.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel   \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). He mitigated security concerns regarding Guideline (Personal Conduct). \nClearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 19, 2007. \nOn March 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under Guidelines \nF (Financial) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 30, 2008\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 23, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 1, \n2008, and I received the case assignment on May 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on May 7, 2008, for a hearing on May 30, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled.  \n \nAt the hearing, the government offered five exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant submitted 17 exhibits which were admitted without \nobjection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non June 11, 2008. I granted Applicant=s request to keep the record open until June 30, \n2008, to submit additional evidence. One  additional document was received and admitted \nwithout objection. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one (SOR & 1.r) of the 22 \nallegations in the SOR relating to approximately $60,000 in delinquent debts. He denied the \none personal conduct allegation (SOR & 2.a.). \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a government contractor working as an \navionics technician since May 2006. He did similar work while on active duty as an E 6 in \nthe Air Force for 14 years and for other defense contractors. He is married with two \nchildren, a son who is 20 and enlisting in the Marines and a daughter who is 18 living at \nhome. \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2000 and it was discharged in \nFebruary 2001 (SOR & 1.u. and v.). Most of the debts which were discharged arose from \nunsuccessful real estate investments.  \n \n \nThe principal sources of the delinquent debts alleged were from three auto \nrepossessions totaling $45,000 (SOR && 1.l., 1.m., 1.o., and 1.p.), and medical bills for his \ndaughter totaling $7,000 (SOR && 1.a-i.). There was an additional $2,000 of medical bills \nnot alleged in the SOR which were paid. The remaining debts in the SOR were from a \nvariety of sources such as cell phones and other consumer services. Although Applicant \nadmitted all but one of the debts in his answer, at the hearing he questioned the validity of \nsome and believed that one for insurance (SOR & 1.s.) had been paid. He offered no \nsupporting evidence.   \n \n \nApplicant believes that one of the four auto repossession allegations were subsumed \nin one of the others and that the total owed is approximately $35,000. He entered into an \nagreement with a law firm to pay $250 per month on the repossessions but failed to \ncontinue the payments after $600 was paid (Tr. 32).  Other than this effort very little contact \nhas been made with the creditors after he determined that creditors were demanding large \npayments which he could not make (Tr. 51 and 52).  None of the alleged debts have been \npaid in full including several of the medical debts below $100.  \n \n\n \n3\n \nOne allegation concerns a state tax lien for $629 (SOR & 1.t.). That debt is also the \nsubject of the allegation under Guideline B relating to failure to reveal it on his SF 86 in \nanswer to  Question 27. He denied knowing about the lien (Exh. Q) until he received the \nSOR. He has been in negotiation with the state tax authorities who have withheld payment \nof his tax refund for 2007 of $250 to apply against the lien.  The matter has not been fully \nresolved (Tr. 72).  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he and his wife were not living within their means when \nmany of the debts occurred, and that they had acted irresponsibly (Tr. 56). However, their \nproblems were compounded when their daughter was assaulted while a hospitalized \nmedical patient. They reacted to this event by leaving their home and employment in the \nsouth and moving to the northwest for a year where he had no significant employment. Two \nauto repossessions occurred when they left for the northwest leaving the cars to be \nrepossessed by the creditors. A third auto repossession occurred when they left the \nnorthwest a year later to return to the south because the death of his father-in-law and \nassistance required of them for his mother-in-law.  He was re-employed in his former job \nupon their return.  \n \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had not sought credit counseling as he did not \nthink they could help him. He had thought about filing a second Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition but was concerned that to do so would further jeopardize his security clearance (Tr. \n58). He had no plan to resolve his financial problems. After the hearing he did seek credit \ncounseling and so advised me in his post-hearing submission.  The service declined to \nwork with him as they did not feel they could help him. \n  \n \nApplicant=s annual salary from his employment is approximately $60,000. His wife is \na nurse whose income last year was approximately $45,000 when she was working in \nanother state. She is again employed in their home state.  They hope to begin paying their \ndebts but recognize that it will take substantial time with the limited funds that they have \nafter paying their expenses as revealed in their budget analysis. \n  \n  \nApplicant lives within the family income. They have two smaller autos for which they \npay a total of $650 per month in payments. They have no credit cards. When they left for \nthe northwest, their home was foreclosed so they now rent a home  for $1,500 per month \n(Tr. 47-50).  \n  \nApplicant is well regarded in his work by his supervisors (Exhs. E - G, and  L - P) \nand has received several awards from his company (Exhs. H \u2013J). He has shown steady \ngrowth in the company and is on a steady rise in his evaluations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n4\n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge=s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \n\n \n5\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG \n& 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. Similarly \nunder AG & 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns. Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and was unable or \nunwilling to pay the obligations for several years. Thus, the evidence clearly raises these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG & 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Most of Applicant=s \nfinancial problems arose in the past four years when he had medical expenses for his \ndaughter and precipitously left his job and home to move to another state leaving property \nand debts.  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife are now employed with a combined income of over $100,000 \nper annum the past year. Yet no action has been taken to resolve even the smallest of the \ndelinquent debts.  While several of the alleged debts in the SOR appear to be duplicative or \nerroneous, even when those are mitigated, significant debts remain that are unresolved \nwith no plan to pay them other than a hope to do so.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), the security concern also may be mitigating where Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control \n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a \ndeath, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.@ As noted above, some of the financial problems arose from his medical \nproblems and periods of reduced income. However, his actions since the debts arose \ncannot be deemed responsible as he has admitted. He has paid only two debts totaling less \nthan $2,000 and these were not on the SOR.  \n \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Applicant\u2019s contacts with \ncreditors has been minimal. While it is not necessary for mitigation to apply that all of the \ndelinquent debts be resolved, it is necessary that a significant portion of this many debts be \nsettled or paid. I believe this test has not been met. He should have taken steps earlier to \nresolve some of the debts. He has only recently attempted to obtain credit counseling. \nWhile he was rejected for the credit counseling service, had he sought it earlier, a different \nresult might have been obtained. Thus, the mitigating conditions do not apply. \n \n\n \n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 \n15:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n AG \u00b6 16 describes the condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \nApplicant is alleged to have failed to report the state tax lien for $629 (SOR& 1. t.). \nAt the hearing he testified credibly that he was unaware of the lien until he received the \nSOR.   \n \nThe requirement in the guideline is that the omission be deliberate, I find that the \nomission alleged was not deliberate. Security concerns pertaining to personal conduct are \nmitigated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual=s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n7\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has incurred expenses growing \nout of the medical problems of his daughter but the actions he has taken in leaving his job \nand abandoning property to be repossessed seems somewhat irrational and not illustrative \nof the best judgment.

On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 7, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on July 24, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 13, 2008, and I \nreceived the case assignment on the same day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nSeptember 16, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 16, 2008. \nThe Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 11, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through D, without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 23, 2008.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 24, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f of the SOR. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 58 years old, divorced from his first wife by whom he had two now-\nadult children, and currently is remarried.  He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy \nin 1972, and served five years on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps.  He served in \nthe Marine Reserves for another 12 years.  He works for a defense contractor, and \nseeks a secret clearance.  During his military career he had security clearances, and \nhad no record of any violations of regulations during those periods. (Tr. 16, 17, 25, 26, \n35; Exhibit 1)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts owed by Applicant.  These debts total \n$11,704.  Appellant\u2019s Answer with attachments, and his testimony and exhibits at the \nhearing, show he has addressed each of the debts, paying them in full or regularly \npaying on an installment payment agreement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first delinquent debt listed in the SOR (Paragraph 1.a) was $519 \nowed to an energy utility.  He paid it in full in January 2007. (Tr. 27; Answer with \nAttachment 1; Exhibits 2-4, A) \n \n \nThe second debt (Paragraph 1.b) was owed to an apartment owner in the \namount of $1,585.  The debt went to judgment.  Applicant paid the judgment in full on \nSeptember 18, 2008, in the amount of $1,319.63. (Tr. 27; Exhibits 2-4, A, B) \n \n \nThe third debt (Paragraph 1.c) was owed on a telephone company bill in the \namount of $261.  This debt was paid in full on July 18, 2008. (Tr. 28, 29; Answer and \nAttachment 3; Exhibits 2-4, A) \n \n \nThe fourth debt listed in the SOR (Paragraph 1.d) is $2,385 owed to a bank on a \ncredit card.  There is an installment payment agreement in place.  Applicant pays $154 \nmonthly.  He will have this debt paid within 12 months. (Tr. 27, 29; Answer and \nAttachment 4; Exhibits 2-4, D)  \n \n \nThe fifth debt listed in the SOR (Paragraph 1.e) is $1,639 owed to a bank on a \ncredit card. This debt was paid in full on August 25, 2008. (Tr. 29; Answer and \nAttachment 5; Exhibits 2-4, A) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe sixth debt listed in the SOR (Paragraph 1.f) is $494 owed to a telephone \ncompany.  It was paid in full on January 9, 2007. (Tr. 29; Answer with Attachment 6; \nExhibits 2-4, A) \n \n \nThe seventh and last debt listed in the SOR (Paragraph 1.g) totals $4,821and is \nowed to a collector.  The original debt was owed to a bank.  Applicant has an \ninstallment payment agreement in place with this creditor to pay $350 monthly.  The \nbalance owed is $3,333.90. (Tr. 27, 29; Answer and Attachment 7; Exhibits 2-4, A, C) \n \n \nThese delinquent debts arose when Applicant was unemployed from January \n2001 to April 2002.  After his divorce in 1998, Applicant was ordered to pay $1,600 \nmonthly to his former wife.  When unemployed, he was still obligated to pay this amount \nfrom his $1,200 monthly unemployment compensation pay.  Applicant was able to get \nthe court to reduce his spousal support payments to $1,000 monthly, and extend the \npayment term to eight years from six years.  While paying this spousal support, \nApplicant was not able to pay his then-current debts.  He has not incurred additional \ndebt since he was re-employed in 2002. (Tr. 17, 18, 29, 30; Answer and Attachment 8) \n \n \nApplicant lives in the home owned by his new wife, and helps her pay the \nmortgage.  He owns two cars on which nothing is owed.  He has two credit cards, one \nwith a $400 limit, and the other with a $350 limit.  He has never made a late payment on \nthem, and his balances are below the limits.  He owes additional income tax for 2002 in \nthe amount of $6,000, which he wants to repay in a lump sum settlement.  He is \nconsulting an attorney about resolving this debt. (Tr. 31-33) \n \n \nApplicant presented a disciplined program of individual responsibility in paying \nhis delinquent debts.  Some debts were paid before the SOR was issued.  Applicant \ndisclosed his debts on his SF 86.  He saves $2,000 monthly now. He is a very \npersuasive and credible witness. (Tr. 34) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay \nthese obligations over the past five years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial worries arose between 2001 and 2002. He accumulated some delinquent debt \ndue to his 15 months of unemployment, and his court-ordered spousal support \npayments, which consumed most of his unemployment compensation. These \ncircumstances are no longer extant. The behavior occurred under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this \npotentially mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of \nthe financial problems arose from his unemployment.  In the following years, he did not \nincur additional obligations that became delinquent. He acted responsibly in identifying \nand resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for \nconsideration.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c).  This mitigating condition applies because \nthere is clear evidence that the delinquent debts are resolved and and his finances are \nunder control.   \n \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant \nresolved all the delinquent debts, either by payment in five of them or installment \npayment agreements in two situations. These actions demonstrate his good-faith effort \nto resolve his debts responsibly. He is now financially sound and prepared for future \ncontingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was a mature adult.  He fell on hard financial times when he lost his job and \nhad to continue to pay spousal support.  He did not incur additional debt, and worked to \nrepay his delinquent debts.  His problems have not recurred.  There is no potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, and no likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  He pays his current monthly bills, and saves $2,000 monthly with his new \nwife. Applicant demonstrated great maturity and responsibility toward his financial \nobligations. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 26, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 22, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 2, 2008. Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant is indebted to Bank of America and/or its assignees in the approximate\namount of $13,367.00.

He attached to his SOR response a March 24, 2008 letter from CLC. The\nletter from CLC states that the purpose of the letter is to \u201cclarify the scope of\nrepresentation that this firm is providing\u201d to the applicant, and then states the applicant\nretained the firm \u201cfor the limited purpose of auditing as to whether or not his creditors\nwere in compliance with the Truth in Lending Act, Fair Credit Billing Act, and the Fair\nCredit Reporting Act.\u201d This letter would seem to rule out any type of repayment contract\napplicant claims he has with CLC.\nHowever, in his March 2008 response to interrogatories sent to him by DOHA,\napplicant stated that \u201cas you can see [from his attachments to his response] the\nConsumer Law Firm takes out $245.25 monthly of [sic] my checking account at Suntrust\nBank,\u201d and he attached to his response one page of what appears to be a seven page\ncontract with CLC. The part of the contract he attached indicates that he will pay CLC\n$245.25 monthly for approximately 48 months, CLC will receive a fee of 25% of the total\ndebt placed with the firm, and applicant\u2019s monthly payment will be distributed in\naccordance with \u201cExhibit A.\u201d This one page, together with the evidence applicant\nprovided showing he made a February 2008 payment to CLC in the amount of $245.25,\nindicates there probably is a repayment contract in effect between applicant and CLC.\nHowever, because applicant did not provide the rest of the contract, including \u201cExhibit\nA,\u201d this evidence does not prove that his two remaining delinquent debts are covered by\nthis contract, let alone that the two debts are actually being paid. Furthermore, the fact\nthat applicant presented proof of just one payment to CLC raises substantial doubt that\nthe terms of the agreement are being honored.\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on or about August 2, 2007. In response to two questions on the e-QIP,\napplicant denied that (1) in the prior seven years he had been over 180 days delinquent\n\n3\non any debt and (2) he was then over 90 days delinquent on any debts. In fact,\napplicant was over 180 days delinquent on the Bank of America and Citibank debts\nwhen he completed the e-QIP. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated he \u201cdid not\ndeliberately withhold any knowledge about [his] financial situation since [he] was at that\ntime unaware of said difficulties. My wife disclosed this information to me until [sic] the\nend of August 2007, shortly after she sought professional guidance to resolve our credit\ncard debt.\u201d  I find that applicant\u2019s false answers were not intentional.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\n\n4\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his\nfinancial obligations is ongoing. He failed to establish that his financial irresponsibility\nwill not recur. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d In his\nresponse to the SOR, applicant stated that his wife was injured at work and underwent\ntwo surgeries, and when she returned to work she was unable to work overtime, which\ndecreased her earnings. Although such an injury was undoubtedly beyond applicant\u2019s\ncontrol, he failed to provide the details required to make a finding he acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances. Accordingly, this mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. There is no evidence of counseling.\nApplicant retained CLC in August 2007 to deal with his last two debts. Although\napplicant made at least one payment to CLC, there is no evidence that any money has\ngone to either creditor. Accordingly, this  mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition does not apply for the same reason Paragraph 20.c does not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\n\n5\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is not applicable because applicant did not deliberately provide\nthe false information on the e-QIP.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of not\nmeeting his financial obligations. In August 2007, he and his wife went to CLC for help\nin resolving their financial problems. It has been about a year since they signed up with\nCLC, and it appears the only help they received consisted of getting the entries in their\ncredit reports changed. There is no credible evidence that their remaining two creditors,\nholding past-due debts totaling more than $15,000.00, have been paid anything.\nApplicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to address these financial obligations in any\nmeaningful way leaves me no choice but to conclude he failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns arising from Guideline F.\n\n6\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 8, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 15, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant admits that as of February 20, 2008, she was indebted to the following\ncreditors in the following approximate amounts: an unidentified medical provider $50.00;\nFinal Asst (Nordstroms) $285.00; Capt Recov (Pepco) $805.00; Metro Adjt (Capitol\nBeltway) $481.00; NCC Busn (Park Forest Apt) $431.00; Metro Adjt (Enterprise)\n$227.00; ACC (Providian) $1,384.00; Verizon Maryland $202.00; Zenith Acquis\n$150.00; Dept of Educ $4,469.00; JKIII Koon (Auto) $6,735.00; IMAG/FBOFD\n$1,608.00; Diners/Citi $3,588.00; Certegy $115.00; and AFFL Fin (Auto) $15,321.00. All\nof these debts were either placed for collection or charged off.\nApplicant admits that as of June 23, 2007, she was indebted to the following\ncreditors in the following approximate amounts: AAC (Gateway) $3,288.00; Allied Coll\n$172.00; Americredit $14,644.00; IC Systems $332.00; Marauder Corp $2,053.00; NCO\nFin/99 $234.00; Paragonway $436.00; GECC $774.00; Yourbank $1,915.00; and\nCypress Creek $1,682.00. All of these debts were placed for collection.\nApplicant denies she was indebted to four of the creditors listed in the SOR. With\nrespect to SOR Allegation 1.b., Exhibit 6 establishes the existence of the $577.00\nNationlse debt. With respect to SOR Allegation 1.k., applicant provided proof that the\n$502.00 child/family support debt has been resolved. With respect to SOR Allegation\n1.u., the $275.00 Finn Assis debt appears to be the same debt as the Final Asst\n(Nordstrom) debt noted above. With respect to SOR Allegation 1.ac., the existence of\nthe $249.00 tax lien is established by Exhibit 5.\nIn her response to the SOR, applicant claims to have paid off one $50.00 medical\ndebt. Although she attached a copy of a $50.00 money order, it is unclear which debt\nshe addressed with this payment. She also claims that after she received the SOR, she\ncontacted or tried to contact the other creditors listed in the SOR, and with respect to\nthe ones she contacted, she made payment arrangements with them. The only\ndocumentation she provided to support her claim of payment arrangements were copies\nof 15 checks made payable to various creditors. There is no evidence that the creditors\never received or cashed these checks, but even if I concluded they received and\ncashed them, they do not corroborate applicant\u2019s statements that payment\narrangements were reached with these creditors.\nIn her SOR response, applicant stated that this \u201cwhole ordeal has taught me a\nvaluable lesson. I have taken the necessary steps to correct my mistakes and debts.\u201d\nShe further stated that her financial delinquencies were caused by situations beyond\nher control, which appear to be a marital separation and her husband becoming\ndisabled. \nLetters from two of applicant\u2019s coworkers and a friend were attached to her SOR\nresponse. The authors of these letters state applicant is reliable and honest. \n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\n\n4\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay her debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant has a large number of\noutstanding delinquent debts that she failed to address until after she received the SOR.\nHer indifference toward these debts casts doubt on her current judgment and reliability.\nThis mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nfailed to provide specific details to support a finding that her present financial\ndelinquencies were caused by factors largely beyond her control. And, the evidence\ndoes not support a finding that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. This\nmitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20. c. This mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant claims\nthat after she received the SOR, she contacted or tried to contact her creditors to work\nout payment arrangements. She further claims that she successfully made payment\narrangements with many of her creditors. Applicant\u2019s failure to offer credible evidence\ncorroborating her claim of payment arrangements makes her claim suspect. But even if\nher claim was accepted as true, her efforts, initiated after she received the SOR, hardly\nqualify as a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors. This mitigating condition does\nnot apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n\n5\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nhas a recent history of ignoring her financial obligations. She claims that after she\nreceived the SOR, she made payment arrangements with most if not all of the creditors\nshe was able to contact. This uncorroborated claim is highly suspect. But even if\naccepted as true, her failure to act until after she received the SOR indicates she was\nmotivated by self interest, and not by any sense of obligation to her creditors. Her\nconduct reflects adversely on her current judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on June 22, 2007. On April \n15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 30, 2008; answered it on \nMay 1, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received \nthe request on May 5, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 16, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on June 2, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 18, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1, 2, and 4 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. GX 3 was admitted in part. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough T, which were admitted without objection. The record closed on June 18, 2008. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 27, 2008. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 5, a personal subject interview extracted from a \nreport of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and he \ndeclined to waive it (Tr. 39). GX 5 was not admitted. The same personal subject \ninterview is included in the DOHA interrogatories offered as GX 3. I admitted GX 3 \nexcept for the part containing GX 5 (Tr. 41-42). \n \nApplicant offered three recent decisions by DOHA administrative judges involving \nGuideline H (AX S, T, and U). Department Counsel did not object. I admitted the three \ndecisions, recognizing that security clearance decisions are fact-specific and that \ndecisions of other administrative judges are not binding precedent.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old senior solutions architect for a federal contractor \nproviding information technology services. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business \nadministration in December 1999. He worked for a federal contractor from May 2000 to \nMarch 2005, and he has worked for his current employer since April 2005. He does not \nhave a security clearance (Tr. 8).  \n \n \nThe president and chief executive officer of Applicant\u2019s current employer has \nknown him since he was hired and worked closely with him. He described Applicant as \nan employee whose technical expertise, knowledge of the government marketplace and \nability to implement complex technical solutions has been invaluable. He states that \nApplicant has always demonstrated sound judgment, reliability, integrity, and \n\u201cunquestionable\u201d professionalism in dealing with customers and colleagues (AX A). \n \n \nThe company official who hired Applicant for his current position testified \nApplicant \u201cfar exceeded\u201d his expectations (Tr. 60-61). He testified Applicant has never \nbeen unreliable, untrustworthy, exhibited questionable judgment, or violated any \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncompany rules (Tr. 61). He testified Applicant did not sign any documents \nacknowledging that drug use was against company policy, because the company has \nno such policy (Tr. 61-62). Finally, he testified he was unaware of Applicant\u2019s use of \nillegal drugs until three or four weeks before the hearing (Tr. 63). \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s co-workers testified that Applicant is a \u201chighly valued member\u201d \nof their team. He testified Applicant exhibits initiative and is very reliable (Tr. 71). \nApplicant disclosed his previous drug use to this witness before the hearing. The \nwitness was unaware of any company policy prohibiting off-duty drug use (Tr. 73-75). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals from his present and former employers \nuniformly praise him for his technical expertise, communication skills, and concern for \ncustomers (AX E, F, and K). The only negative comment in his appraisals states that he \nvoluntarily takes on too much work (AX E). He has received numerous pay raises and \nbonuses (AX G, H, I, and J). He has been trained and certified in several additional \ntechnical skills while working for his current employer (AX M, N, and O). \n \n \nApplicant executed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on \nOctober 19, 2000, in which he disclosed using marijuana from October 1995 to April \n1999 (GX 2). Applicant testified he believed the application was submitted to enable him \nto work on a specific government contract, but that he did not have access to classified \nor sensitive data while working on that contract (Tr. 78). \n \n \nIn his security clearance application dated June 22, 2007, Applicant disclosed \nusing ecstasy (MDMA) about six times between January 2002 and January 2007, using \ncocaine about 15 times between December 2003 and December 2006, using marijuana \nabout 75 times between September 1993 and October 2006, using pain killers without a \nprescription about four times between January 2002 and January 2006, using hashish \nonce in March 1998, using mushrooms once in September 1996, and using lysergic \nacid diethylamide (LSD) once in December 1995. He corroborated his disclosures of \ndrug use during an interview by a security investigator on October 31, 2007 (GX 4), and \nhe admitted them in his answer to the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s one-time uses of hashish, mushrooms, and LSD were in college. \nAfter college, Applicant used ecstasy about once a year, usually with college friends at \nthe beach. He always obtained it from his former college roommate, and he used it with \nhis former roommate and his roommate\u2019s wife (GX 4 at 3). He used cocaine about five \ntimes a year, usually at house parties with his former roommate and his roommate\u2019s \nwife. The cocaine was supplied by his former roommate (GX 4 at 4). Applicant last used \necstasy and cocaine in December 2006, on New Year\u2019s Eve. He also used marijuana at \nparties, obtained either from his former roommate or \u201cfriends of friends.\u201d His last use of \nmarijuana was in October 2006 (GX 4 at 4). \n \n \nApplicant did not use pain killers recreationally, but for pain relief. On one \noccasion his father gave him a prescription pain killer to relieve the pain of having \nwisdom teeth extracted.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified he is very serious about his career, his health, his girlfriend, \nand his family. He testified he no longer associates with drug users. However, he \nadmitted on cross-examination that he and his former college roommate are still friends, \nexplaining that his former roommate no longer uses illegal drugs (Tr. 90). He testified \nhis girlfriend was present on a few occasions when he used drugs, but that she does \nnot use drugs (Tr. 89-90). In early August 2008, Applicant and his girlfriend are moving \nto another city, which will further separate him from his past drug use (Tr. 82-83). \n \nApplicant and his girlfriend have dated for about five and a half years and lived \ntogether for the last two years. His girlfriend submitted a statement expressing her belief \nthat Applicant has matured and put his drug use behind him. She does not use drugs \nand does not desire to associate with drug users. (AX B). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal physician for the past three years describes him as reliable, \ntrustworthy and of sound judgment. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s history of drug use and \nbelieves he does not need any treatment or rehabilitation for his past drug use (AX C). \n \n \nApplicant voluntarily underwent urinalysis testing for drugs in June 2008, twelve \ndays before the hearing. All tests were negative (AX Q). At the hearing, he submitted a \nsigned and notarized statement of intent to never use illegal drugs again, stating that he \nunderstands that any use of illegal drugs will result in immediate revocation of any \nsecurity clearance (AX R). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe SOR alleges multiple instances of illegal drug use between December 1995 \nand January 2007. The concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal \ndrug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.@ AG \u00b6 24. This guideline encompasses use or misuse of Adrugs, materials, \nand other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of \n1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and \nhallucinogens). AG \u00b6 24(a)(1). Drug abuse is Athe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal \ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b). \n \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include Aany drug abuse,@ and \nAillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.@ AG \u00b6 25(a) and (c). The evidence \nin this case raises these two disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of \u00b6 \n26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on the recency of drug involvement. There are \nno Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must \nbe based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time \nhas passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s last illegal drug use was about 17 months before the hearing, a \nsignificant period of time. However, this 17-month period of abstinence must be \nconsidered in the context of 13 years of illegal drug use. Applicant and his long-time \ngirlfriend, who disapproves of drug use, began living together about two years ago. \nApplicant has become more concerned about his health, apparently recognizing the \ndeleterious effects of drug abuse. He has rapidly advanced in pay and responsibility at \nwork. His family doctor believes he requires no treatment or rehabilitation. His focus has \nshifted from parties with old college friends to his girlfriend, his job, and his future. He is \nhighly respected at work, and his security clearance application is strongly supported by \nsenior officials as well as colleagues at his company. I conclude the first prong of AG \u00b6 \n26(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is established. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not fully established, however, unless the conduct in question does \nnot cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. One \nfactor demonstrating his current reliability is the absolute candor he has displayed \nthroughout the security clearance process. His full disclosure of his drug involvement in \nhis security clearance application was the only evidence of drug abuse. He was candid, \nopen, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He told his supervisors and peers about his \ndrug abuse before the hearing. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(1)-(4).  \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant told a security investigator he was \u201cclean\u201d and never \nintended to use illegal drugs again. He repeated the same promise at the hearing. He \ntestified he no longer associates with drug users, but he admitted maintaining his \nfriendship with his primary supplier of cocaine and ecstasy in their post-college years, \nexplaining that his friend no longer uses drugs. I am not satisfied that AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) \n(\u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates\u201d) is established, but I am satisfied AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3) (\u201cappropriate period of abstinence\u201d) and AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) (\u201csigned statement of \nintent\u201d) are established. Applicant used the phrase \u201cimmediate revocation\u201d instead of \n\u201cautomatic revocation,\u201d but his intent clearly was to satisfy AG \u00b6 26(b)(4). In light of his \ncompany\u2019s lax drug policies, it is unlikely that Applicant\u2019s supervisors will vigorously \nmonitor his compliance with the statement of intent, but the statement nevertheless \ndemonstrates the sincerity of his intention to refrain from further drug abuse. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished because Applicant has not received any drug treatment. I have considered, \nhowever, the opinion of his friend and family doctor that he does not need treatment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant illegally used drugs after submitting a security \nclearance application on October 19, 2000. The evidence indicates that Applicant \napplied for a trustworthiness determination, not a security clearance. Nevertheless, the \ngovernment produced substantial evidence that he illegal used drugs while his \napplication was pending and while he was working on a government contract. The \nrelevant concern under this guideline is: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack \nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions are relevant to this case. A disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(c). A \ndisqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201ccredible adverse information that is not \nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d). This disqualifying condition includes but is not limited to \u201ca \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d)(4). Applicant\u2019s long history of drug \nabuse is sufficient to indicate questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nand unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. I recognize that the language of \nAG \u00b6 16(d) suggests that it is inapplicable to conduct explicitly covered under another \nguideline, but the Appeal Board has construed it more broadly. See ISCR Case No. 06-\n20964, 2008 WL 2002589 at *5 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008). Thus I conclude AG \u00b6 16(c) \nand (d) are raised. \n \n \nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of \ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e). Although \nApplicant\u2019s colleagues, his girlfriend, his current supervisors, and some of his peers are \naware of his history of drug abuse, there is no indication that his company\u2019s customers, \ngovernment officials supervising the contracts with his company, and the appropriate \nlaw enforcement officials are aware of it. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 16(e) is raised. \nFinally, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cassociation with persons \ninvolved in criminal activity.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(g). Applicant was aware that he and his drug-\nusing friends were violating the law. Thus AG \u00b6 16(g) is raised. \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence raising AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), \n(e), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Security concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse was not minor, infrequent, or committed under unique \ncircumstances. For the reasons set out above under Guideline H, however, I conclude \nthat his conduct is mitigated by the passage of a significant drug-free time period, and it \ndoes not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his illegal behavior and \nabstained from illegal drug use for 17 months. He claims to have disassociated himself \nfrom his former drug-using companions, but he maintains his friendship with his former \ncollege roommate who supplied him with illegal drugs in their post-college days. \nHowever, he has shifted his focus from partying with old college friends to his long-time \ngirlfriend and his job. His most recent job appraisal, critiquing him for taking on too \n\n \n9 \n \n \nmuch work, demonstrates his change of focus. He soon will move to another \ngeographical location, further separating himself from his former lifestyle. I conclude AG \n\u00b6 17(d) is established.  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201c(e) the \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant fully disclosed his previous drug abuse \non his security clearance application, admitted it to a security investigator, and told his \nsupervisors about it. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(e) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant was very candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He was very well \nprepared for the hearing, reflecting his appreciation for the seriousness of his \nmisconduct. His deepening commitment to his long-time girlfriend, who disapproves of \ndrug abuse, appears to be a major factor in his change of attitude and lifestyle.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 4, 2008, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nthe government\u2019s written case on April 25, 2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nJune 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant received the FORM on April 30, 2008. He responded on May 21, 2008, with a \nletter and seven pages of documents. I received the case assignment on May 29, 2008. \nI have marked the seven pages of documents as Exhibit (Ex.) A, and they are admitted.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. Applicant did not object. The request for administrative \nnotice is approved. The request and the attached documents are not admitted into \nevidence but are included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out in \nthe Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He was born in Iran. \nApplicant came to the United States when he was in his early twenties to attend college. \nHe graduated from an American college and also obtained a Master of Science degree \nfrom an American university.

They \nhave two children who were born in the United States, ages 17 and 15.1 \n \n \nApplicant visited Iran on three occasions between about 2000 and 2006, when \nhis parents were ill. His parents are now both deceased. He traveled to Iran using an \nIranian passport, which has since been relinquished.2  \n \n \nApplicant has two brothers and two sisters who are citizens and residents of Iran.  \nNone of his siblings are employed by the government of Iran. His brothers and sisters \nhave never visited him in the United States. Applicant speaks with them on the \ntelephone about once or twice a year.3 \n \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s mother passed away, the family home was inherited by \nApplicant and his four siblings. The house is old and is not worth much. Applicant has \ndeclared his desire to divest himself of any property right he might have in the house. \nHe does not have any other Iranian assets. He has considerable U.S. assets. He has a \nstable work history. Applicant is not a member of Iran\u2019s official religion and has \nexpressed disdain for their repressive regime.4 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Items 5, 6; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n2 Items 4, 5, 6. \n \n3 Items 4, 5, 6; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n4 Id. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d The U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n \n\u2022 Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD);  \n\u2022 Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n\u2022 Its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and \n\u2022 Its dismal human rights record. \n \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq is also a concern. \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the world\u2019s leading state \nsponsor of terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. \n \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens, even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian, \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iran, a \ncountry that is clearly hostile to the United States.5 It is considered the world\u2019s leading \nstate sponsor of terrorism, and the government of Iran has committed numerous, \nserious human rights abuses against its people. His siblings\u2019 presence in Iran creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nIt also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by the \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s minimal interest in the family home in Iran is insufficient to raise a \ndisqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.c is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). \n\n \n6 \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has been in this country for more than 25 years and has been a U.S. \ncitizen since 1993. His wife is an American citizen and his two children were born in the \nUnited States. However, because of his close family ties to Iran and the nature of the \ngovernment of Iran, I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Iran. He came \nto the U.S. when he was in his early twenties and became a U.S. citizen in 1993. His \nwife and two children are U.S. citizens. He has a stable work history and considerable \nU.S. assets. Applicant agreed with Department Counsel\u2019s characterization of the Iranian \ngovernment and expressed disdain for its repressive regime.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. Iran is the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of \nterrorism and has a dismal human rights record. His four siblings are citizens and \nresidents of Iran. That raises considerable security concerns that Applicant was unable \nto mitigate. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nForeign Influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Two government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) were\nadmitted and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on July 8,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn May 28, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be taken\nof certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and its foreign\nrelations, including with the U.S. The request was based on publications from the\nDepartment of State,  the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies,  the U.S.\n1\n2\nChina Economic and Security Review Commission,  and the Office of the National\n3\nCounterintelligence Executive.  The government\u2019s formal request and the attached\n4\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. \nOn June 4, 2008, I notified the parties of my intention to take administrative\nnotice of specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at the\nhearing and any valid objections. The parties were informed that any objections would\nbe taken up at the hearing scheduled for June 27, 2008. At the hearing, Applicant did\nnot object to any specific fact, but questioned their relevance to her case. I agreed to\ntake administrative notice of particular facts pertaining to the PRC, as set forth in the\nFindings of Fact.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s mother is a\ncitizen of the PRC who resides with her in the U.S. part of the time and spends the\nremainder in the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant supports her mother financially when\nher mother is in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that Applicant\u2019s stepfather (SOR \u00b6 1.c), aunt\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f), and two brothers-in-law and one sister-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are resident\ncitizens of the PRC; that Applicant has provided financial support for a brother-in-law\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that Applicant traveled to the PRC in August 2004 to visit her family\n\n3\nand her spouse\u2019s family (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In her answer of May 5, 2008, Applicant admitted\nthe allegations, adding in explanation that her mother came to the U.S. in November\n2004 on an immigrant visa and went back to the PRC once, from October 2005 to\nMarch 2006. She indicated that the Internal Revenue Service requires that she support\nher mother while she is in the U.S. on an immigrant visa. Applicant averred that she had\nprovided financial aid to her brother-in-law a few years ago when he needed it to raise\nhis children, and that she cannot change the PRC citizenship and residency of her\nfamily members and her spouse\u2019s family members. After considering the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior engineer (\u201cprogrammer\u201d) who has been\nemployed by a U.S. defense contractor since August 2005. (Ex. 1, Tr. 38). She seeks a\nsecret clearance, never having held a security clearance in the past (Tr. 30).\nApplicant was born in the PRC in October 1968 to native citizens (Ex. 1). Her\nmother was employed in a textile factory that Applicant believes was government-\nowned (Tr. 72-73). When Applicant was in her late teens, her mother remarried (Tr. 59).\nAn only child, Applicant was educated in the PRC through undergraduate school.\nShe lived at home part of the time while in college (Tr. 59). In 1991, she earned her\nbachelor of science degree in computer science from a PRC university (Tr. 37). She\nworked as a cashier at a hotel from July 1991 to February 1992. From June 1992 to\nOctober 1993, she was an employee of a real estate management company (Ex. 1, Ex.\n2). In August 1993, she married a PRC native citizen in her hometown (Ex. 1, Tr. 35).\nIn November 1993, Applicant joined her spouse in the U.S. where he was\nfurthering his education (Ex. 2, Tr. 36). He was in the U.S. initially on a student visa but\nobtained a work visa and they made their home here (Ex. 2). The first of their two\nchildren, a daughter, was born in January 1995. Applicant stayed at home to care for\nher (Tr. 64). In October 1997, they had a son. Both children have been citizens solely of\nthe U.S. since their births here (Ex. 1). When her son was nine months old, Applicant\ntook him to the PRC. She stayed at her parents\u2019 residence and did not go to her\nspouse\u2019s hometown (Tr. 62). Her mother and an aunt cared for her son in the PRC for\nthe next three years while Applicant took classes toward her master\u2019s degree in the U.S.\n(Tr. 56). In June 2003, she was awarded her M.S. in computer science (Ex. 1, Tr. 36).\nApplicant worked while pursuing her graduate degree. From May 2000 to April\n2001, she was employed as a consultant. Sometime in 2000, Applicant and her spouse\nwent to the PRC to pick up her son. They returned to the U.S. without him because he\ndid not recognize them (Tr. 62-63). In May 2001, she took a position as an \u201capplication\narchitect\u201d with a publishing company (Ex. 1). Also, in 2001, her spouse returned to the\nPRC to bring their son home. Applicant did not accompany him because of her studies\n(Tr. 56).\nIn early July 2002, Applicant became a naturalized citizen, taking an oath to\nrenounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its\n\n4\nlaws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of\nthe U.S. if required. She was issued her U.S. passport in August 2002 (Ex. 1, Ex. 2).\nHer spouse applied for his U.S. citizenship when she did, and they had their interviews\non the same day (Tr. 66). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2004 (Ex. 1). No\nexplanation was given to them for the delay in processing his citizenship application (Tr.\n66).\nIn November 2002, Applicant traveled to India for her stepsister\u2019s wedding (Ex. 1,\nEx. 2, Tr. 61). Her stepsister, a native of the PRC, married an Indian national (Ex. 2).\nIn August 2004, Applicant and her immediate family (spouse and children) took a\ntwo-week vacation in the PRC to visit relatives. They stayed with her mother and\nstepfather and also visited with her spouse\u2019s siblings (Ex. 2). His parents were already\ndeceased (Ex. 1). Applicant and her family traveled on their U.S. passports. When she\nand her spouse applied for their visas, they had to submit their PRC passports to the\nChinese consulate, which were then invalidated and returned to them (Ex. 2).\nShortly after she acquired her U.S. citizenship, Applicant filed an immigrant\npetition for her mother in about September 2002 (Tr. 66). Applicant\u2019s mother was\ngranted U.S. permanent residency, and she moved in with Applicant and her family in\nthe U.S. in mid-November 2004 (Ex. 1, Tr. 32-34). Applicant\u2019s mother went back to the\nPRC once, from October 2006 to March 2007 (Ex. 2, Tr. 38-40). Applicant assumes she\nreturned to spend time with her husband, although she is not certain (Tr. 41). Applicant\nspoke with her mother by telephone more frequently than once monthly when her\nmother was in the PRC (Tr. 41).\nApplicant was unemployed from December 2004 to August 2005, when she\nstarted her present job (Ex. 1). In April 2007 Applicant complied with repeated requests\nfrom her employer to apply for a security clearance (\u201cI don\u2019t like the trouble too much,\nyou know, and so I didn\u2019t do it for a while. Then, you know, since they just keep asking,\nso I said I think, I said okay, I\u2019ll do it, so I applied for the clearance. . . .\u201d Tr. 31). On her\ne-QIP completed on April 19, 2007, Applicant indicated that her mother, a PRC citizen\nwith U.S. permanent residency, was living at her address in the U.S., but that her\nstepfather was a PRC resident citizen. Her father had died before she executed the e-\nQIP. She disclosed that her stepsister is a resident citizen of the U.S. Applicant\nindicated she had other relatives who are PRC resident citizens:  a maternal aunt, two\nbrothers-in-law, and a sister-in-law. Her parents-in-law were no longer living. Applicant\nresponded \u201cYes\u201d to question 17.b, \u201cAre you now or have you ever been employed by or\nacted as a consultant for a foreign government, firm or agency?\u201d, and she listed her\nformer employment with the housing company and at the ocean hotel in the PRC. In\nresponse to any foreign travel, she listed three trips to Canada, a trip in November 2002\nwhen she went to India, and the August 2004 trip to the PRC (Ex. 1).\nDuring a subject interview with a government investigator on July 13, 2007,\nApplicant provided details of her foreign relatives\u2019 occupations and her contacts with\nthem. She also indicated that her mother travels to China for up to six months periods\n\n5\non a regular basis to stay her husband (Ex. 2). At her hearing, Applicant explained that\nher mother had been to China only once since November 2004, and what she had\nmeant was that her mother could travel on a regular basis to the PRC provided her stay\nthere did not exceed six months (Tr. 40). Applicant also corrected the record to indicate\nthat her former employers in the PRC were hotel and real estate management firms and\nnot the Chinese government. She maintained she misunderstood the foreign\nemployment question on her security clearance application (Ex. 2).\nApplicant has a close relationship with her mother (Tr. 43) who continues to live\nwith them (Tr. 34). She covers her mother\u2019s living expenses in the U.S. Applicant\nbelieves she is required by the IRS to support her mother financially because she\nsponsored her mother\u2019s immigration (Tr. 31, 42). During her mother\u2019s stay in the PRC,\nshe did not provide her any funds. Her mother gets a small pension from her job in a\ntextile factory that was likely owned by the government since there was little private\nownership (Tr. 72). To Applicant\u2019s understanding, the PRC government pays the\npension (Tr. 41-43, 72).  None of Applicant\u2019s relatives have worked directly for the PRC\ngovernment as her maternal grandfather would not have approved (Tr. 67).\nApplicant\u2019s stepfather continues to reside in the PRC where he works in\nstructural engineering. Applicant believes he works for a private company, although she\nis not aware of the particulars (Ex. 2, Tr. 45). He has spoken about immigrating to the\nU.S. but to Applicant\u2019s knowledge, a petition has not been filed on his behalf. He has\nnot asked Applicant to sponsor him (Tr. 44). He has never visited the U.S. (Tr. 47).\nApplicant speaks with him by telephone a few times a year (Tr. 46). She knows her\nmother is in contact with him because she hears about her stepfather from her mother,\nbut she is not sure of the frequency of her mother\u2019s contacts (\u201cI would have to look at\nthe bill, the telephone bill.\u201d Tr. 47). Applicant would not describe her relationship with\nher stepfather as close, but she thinks he is \u201cpretty nice\u201d (Tr. 60).\nApplicant\u2019s aunt (mother\u2019s younger sister) was a cook in the PRC until she\nretired. Applicant maintains telephone contact with her two or three times a year, around\nthe holidays (Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival and Chinese New Year) (Ex. 2, Tr. 53-54).\nApplicant\u2019s mother telephones her sister, and on occasion when she does call,\nApplicant\u2019s son will speak with his great-aunt (Tr. 57).\nThe elder of Applicant\u2019s two brothers-in-law is 67 years old and employed as a\nchef in the PRC (Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 47). He has five grown children, the eldest of whom is\nan engineer in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s other brother-in-law is an engineer in the PRC. To\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge, one of his children is a doctor, the other is an engineer.\nApplicant visited with them during trips to the PRC, but she otherwise has no ongoing\ncontact with her brothers-in-law. Her spouse calls his brothers once every three to six\nmonths (Tr. 48-50). The elder of his brothers was in the U.S. visiting his daughter\naround Chinese New Year in February 2008. Applicant and her spouse saw his brother\nthen. It was her brother-in-law\u2019s first time in the U.S. (Tr. 50).\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a 63-year-old farmer in the PRC. Her spouse works in\na factory. She has never visited the U.S. and Applicant believes her spouse\u2019s contact\nwith his sister is even less frequent than his contact with his brothers (Tr. 51).  They\nstayed with his sister during part of their two weeks in China in August 2004 (Tr. 54).\nApplicant had planned to return to the PRC to visit her family and her spouse\u2019s family\nmembers this year, but decided against it because of the expense (Tr. 58).\n \nUp until his death in September 2005, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law lived with his\neldest son and his family. Applicant\u2019s spouse sent about $500 every three months to his\nbrother for the care of their father. They also helped with the costs of educating his\nbrother\u2019s five children, who have now all graduated. They sent his brother between\n$500 and $1,000 annually to help with tuition costs for his children (Ex. 2, Tr. 52-53, 72).\nApplicant does not own any property or have any financial assets in the PRC (Ex.\n2, Tr. 58). Neither she nor her spouse served in the PRC\u2019s military (Ex. 2). In the event\nof a conflict between the PRC and the U.S., Applicant maintains that she and her\nspouse would fully support the U.S. with no reservations. Applicant and her spouse\nbought their first home in the U.S. in about January 2000. They purchased their present\nresidence in about May 2004 (Ex. 1, Tr. 64). Applicant\u2019s spouse is employed as a\ncomputer programmer for a Japanese company in the U.S. (Tr. 65-66).\nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\neconomic, political, and intelligence activities of the PRC, I take administrative notice of\nthe following facts:\nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of just\nover 1.3 billion people. Its economy grows at about 10% per year. China has an\nauthoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The National\nPeople\u2019s Congress, the PRC\u2019s legislative body, is the highest organ of state power. With\nChina firmly committed to economic reform and greater openness, the influence of\npeople and organizations outside the formal party structure has increased, but in all\nimportant government, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the Chinese\nCommunist Party ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. During 2007,\nthe PRC government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, with a trend toward\nincreased harassment, detention, and imprisonment by government and security\nauthorities of those perceived as threatening to government authority. Foreign visitors in\nthe PRC may be placed under surveillance by security personnel, their hotel rooms,\ntelephones, and facsimile machines monitored, and their personal possessions,\nincluding computers, searched without their knowledge or consent. Foreign government\nofficials, journalists, and business people with access to advanced proprietary\ntechnology are particularly likely to be under surveillance.\nSince the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989, the PRC has become a\nkey participant in the international community through its seat as a permanent member\nof the United Nations, and through diplomatic relations with other countries. The U.S.\nand PRC have a history of cooperation on scientific and  environmental issues.\n\n7\nRecently, the two countries have cooperated with growing effectiveness on\ncounterterrorism and on various aspects of law enforcement (computer crime,\nintellectual property rights, human smuggling, corruption). China, a member of the\nWorld Trade Organization since December 2001, is an important trading partner of the\nU.S. Its trade surplus with the U.S. was $256.3 billion in 2007 while U.S. goods exports\nto China accounted for 5.7% of total U.S. goods exports. The U.S. is the sixth largest\nforeign investor in the PRC.\nThe PRC possesses large military forces (strategic nuclear forces, army, navy\nand air force), which are in the process of transformation into a smaller, more mobile,\nhigh tech military. In the last decade, the PRC\u2019s strategic posture has been one of\nselective modernization with an increasing focus on space-based assets. Civil-military\nintegration has led to increased utilization of commercial systems in military\napplications. The PRC places enormous pressure on foreign companies, including U.S.\nfirms, to transfer technology to Chinese companies as part of doing business in China.\nIn furtherance of these efforts, the PRC has aggressively targeted sensitive and\nprotected U.S. economic and militarily critical information subject to export control laws.\nThe PRC blends intelligence and non-intelligence assets, relying on covert espionage\nactivity by personnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, and military\nindustries independent of the PRC intelligence services, and by targeting ethnic\nChinese who have access to sensitive information. U.S. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement officials have rated China\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the\nleading threat to the security of U.S. technology.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n8\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant, her spouse, and their children are U.S. resident citizens. Her mother, a\nPRC citizen, lives with them. While her mother enjoys the protections of U.S. legal\nresidency, she remains subject to the obligations of her PRC citizenship. Applicant\u2019s\nstepfather, aunt, and her siblings-in-law are all resident citizens of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts with her stepfather and aunt are infrequent, about three times a year, and she\n\n9\ndoes not telephone her brothers-in-law or her sister-in-law. Yet, it is also evident that\nshe feels some bonds of affection and/or obligation for them. She visited with them\nwhen in the PRC, and she and her spouse provided financial assistance to his elder\nbrother for his children in college. Applicant intends to visit with her family members and\nher spouse\u2019s family members on any future trips to the PRC. The only reason she did\nnot travel this year was because of the expense. AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) applies.\nThe bonds that her mother shares with her husband and sister (Applicant\u2019s\nstepfather and aunt) in the PRC, and that her spouse shares with his siblings in the\nPRC, must also be taken into account in assessing the risk of foreign influence (see AG\n\u00b67(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status,\nif that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion\u201d)).\nApplicant\u2019s mother has traveled to the PRC only once since she emigrated in\nNovember 2004, but she stayed from October 2006 to March 2007. Applicant testified\nshe is unsure of the frequency of her mother\u2019s telephone contacts with her stepfather,\nbut she knows they are in contact as she hears about her stepfather from her mother.\nShe also knows that her mother contacts her aunt because Applicant\u2019s son will speak\nwith his great-aunt on occasion. As for any future travel by her mother to see her\nstepfather and her sister, Applicant likewise knows of no details. She expects her\nmother to spend more time in the U.S., but while her stepfather has talked about\nimmigrating to the U.S., he has not started the process. As long as Applicant\u2019s\nstepfather is in the PRC, future travel by her mother to the PRC cannot be ruled out.\nThe government argued persuasively that Applicant\u2019s vulnerability is heightened if her\nmother travels to the PRC where she would be not only subject to its laws, but also\nwithin the reach of any foreign entities that might seek to exert influence to gain access\nto classified information. I am less persuaded that the risk is heightened because of her\nmother\u2019s pension from the PRC. Applicant does not count on that pension to cover any\nof the costs of caring for her mother in the U.S. She has willingly assumed the full cost\nof her mother\u2019s living expenses in the U.S., which she understood she took on by\nsponsoring her mother\u2019s immigration. Should the pension become an issue, Applicant is\nlikely to give her mother whatever money she needs.\nAs for his spouse\u2019s family, Applicant\u2019s spouse contacts his brothers in the PRC\nonly about once every three to six months and his sister even less frequently. However,\nhe and Applicant considered it a family duty to provide financial support on a regular\nbasis for his father until he died and he gave his elder brother between $500 and $1,000\nyearly to help cover educational costs for his brother\u2019s children. AG \u00b6 7(d) applies.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant engaged in any conduct while in the PRC in August\n2004 that implicates security concerns under \u00b6 7(i) (\u201cconduct, especially while traveling\noutside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or\ncoercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d) other than establishing\n\n10\nthe ties to her relatives and her spouse\u2019s relatives, which are more appropriately\naddressed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(d).\nNone of Applicant\u2019s relatives or her spouse\u2019s relatives in the PRC work directly\nfor the PRC government. The only government connection is a pension benefit enjoyed\nby her mother that Applicant cares little about. However, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a)\n(\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d) does not apply because of the close family ties to the PRC and\nthe PRC\u2019s aggressive pursuit of U.S. sensitive and classified information. Applicant\u2019s\nstepfather and one brother-in-law work in the engineering field in the PRC. While both\nare employed in private industry, Applicant provided little to nothing about their\nassociates and affiliations within the PRC. With so little known about their jobs, it is\ndifficult to discount the risk of them being exploited by the PRC government or those in\nindustry targeting U.S. classified data for competitive advantage, although there is no\nevidence that any of her relatives or her spouse\u2019s relatives have been targeted.\nApplicant testified that her stepfather did not try to immigrate to the U.S. with her mother\nbecause of his job (Tr. 45). It is not clear whether it is just the income or something else\nthat keeps him in the PRC when his spouse, daughter, and stepdaughter all live in the\nU.S.\nThe risk of foreign influence may be mitigated by deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d)). Applicant credibly\nasserts a singular loyalty to the U.S. where she is invested financially and\nprofessionally. As soon as she was eligible to do so, she applied for her mother to\nimmigrate to the U.S. While her sense of loyalty or obligation to her native country is\nminimal, I cannot conclude the same with respect to her family ties.\nOver the past 14 years, Applicant has established significant ties to the U.S.,\nmost notably citizenship. She pursued her graduate degree while working part-time and\ncaring for her oldest child. Both her children were born in the U.S. and are U.S. citizens.\nShe has been a homeowner in the U.S. since January 2000 and has no financial assets\nin the PRC. Applicant has worked for her present employer since August 2005.\nHowever, Applicant has not been entirely focused on her life in the U.S. over the past\n14 years. In 1998, she took her son to the PRC so that her mother and an aunt could\ncare for him while she was in school in the U.S. When she and her spouse returned to\nthe PRC to pick him up in 2000, they decided to leave him there. Her spouse eventually\nbrought their son home in 2001. Certainly with her mother\u2019s immigration to the U.S. in\nNovember 2004, Applicant\u2019s bonds to the PRC have lessened considerably. But given\n\n11\nthe facts presented, I am unable to conclude that her ties to the U.S. are sufficiently\ndeep and longstanding to apply AG \u00b6 8(b).\nNone of the other mitigating conditions under Guideline B are pertinent.\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with her stepfather and aunt in the PRC are infrequent and she has\nno ongoing telephone contact with her spouse\u2019s siblings (see AG \u00b6 8(c) (\u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation)). Yet, these\nrelationships are certainly not casual in nature, for the reasons noted in discussing the\napplicability of AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(d). She trusted her aunt to help care for her son\nwhen he was just an infant, and she visited her stepfather and her in-laws when in the\nPRC.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty,\nbut rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See Executive Order\n10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet be in an\nuntenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family member and\nthe interests of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s ties to the PRC are familial. While she does not\nhave the same personal affection for persons living in the PRC that she does to her\nspouse, children, and her mother who are living in the U.S., she has not fully mitigated\nthe foreign influence concerns that exist.\nA Guideline B decision involving the PRC must take into consideration the\ngeopolitical situation. With China firmly committed to economic reform and greater\nopenness, the influence of people and organizations outside the formal party structure\nhas increased, but in all important government, economic, and cultural institutions in\n\n12\nChina, the Chinese Communist Party ensures that party and state policy guidance is\nfollowed. During 2007, the PRC government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, and\nthe PRC is a known collector of U.S. intelligence and economic information. Applicant\nretains ties, primarily through her mother and spouse, to PRC resident citizens, so there\nis the possibility that she could be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign person and the U.S.\nWhile Applicant has lived in the U.S. since November 1993, she did not fully\ndevelop the evidence showing her ties to U.S. citizens and institutions from which I\ncould conclude that she is not likely to succumb to any undue foreign influence.\nApplicant resisted filling out the security clearance application because she wanted to\navoid any problems (\u201cI don\u2019t like the trouble too much\u201d). She appears to be an ethical\nperson with the best interests of her family at heart, but it is precisely this regard for her\nfamily members, some of whom live in the PRC, that creates an unacceptable risk.\nGiven perhaps a change in her family\u2019s situation such as her stepfather\u2019s immigration to\nthe U.S., Applicant may in the future be in a position where she would no longer be at\nrisk of foreign influence. But based on the facts before me for review, I am unable to\nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to\nclassified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an security clearance application, Standard Form 86 (SF 86) \non January 31, 2006. On April 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference, for Applicant. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 19, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a determination \nbe made on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on July 29, 2008. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on that same \ndate. He received it on August 11, 2008.  Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the \nFORM to submit additional matters. He did not submit additional matters. The case was \nassigned to me on October 10, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nand exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nNovember 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel requested that administrative notice be taken \nof certain factual information pertaining to the country of Turkey referenced in four \ndocuments. (Items I \u2013 IV.) The following is a summary of the facts which administrative \nnotice is taken. \n  \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary system and a \npresident with limited powers. In foreign relations, Turkey\u2019s primary political, economic, \nand security ties are with the West. Turkey entered NATO in 1952 and serves as the \norganization\u2019s vital eastern anchor, controlling access from the Black Sea to the \nMediterranean Sea. Turkey shares borders with Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The United States \nand Turkey have a close relationship that began in 1947 with an agreement \nimplementing the Truman Doctine. Turkey cooperates closely with the U.S. on a \nnumber of security issues. (Item I at 1-2, 6-7; Item II at 1.)   \n \nDomestic and transnational terrorist groups have targeted Turkish citizens and \nforeigners in Turkey for more than 40 years. Terrorist bombings over the past five years \n\u2013 some causing significant numbers of casualties \u2013 have struck religious, government, \ngovernment-owned, political, tourist and business targets in a number of locations in \nTurkey. A variety of leftist or Islamic terrorist groups have targeted U.S. and Western \ninterests as well. Terrorists claiming association with Al-Qaeda were responsible for \nsuicide bombings in Istanbul in 2003 that targeted Western interests. The possibility of \nterrorist attacks, both national and indigenous, remains high. (Item III at 28; Item IV at 2-\n3.) \n \nThe Turkish government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; \nhowever, serious problems remained in several areas, including a documented rise in \ncases of torture, beating and abuse by security forces. Other forms of human rights \nabuses continue with respect to detainees, fair criminal trials, freedom of speech, the \npress and religion. In addition, societal attitudes of \u201chonor killing\u201d of women continue to \nbe a widespread problem. (Item II at 1, 6-15, 17-22.)   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 14, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the \nSOR allegations with the exception of SOR \u00b6 2.f.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old software architect/consultant employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since May \n24, 1999. He has a B.S.E degree. He is married and has one son. (Item 4; Item 5; Item \n7.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in the United States. His parents are dual citizens \nof the U.S. and Turkey.  He is a Turkish citizen based on his parents\u2019 status as Turkish \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncitizens. (Item 4; Item 5) His wife is a citizen of Turkey. She resides with Applicant and \ntheir son in the U.S. (Item 3.)   \n \nWhen Applicant was a child, Applicant\u2019s parents applied for Turkish citizenship \nand a Turkish passport on his behalf. The last passport expired in June 1998. Applicant \ndid not renew the Turkish passport because he could travel to Turkey using his U.S. \npassport. Applicant traveled to Turkey using his Turkish passport in July 1988, July \n1990 and July 1992. (Item 5.) After his Turkish passport expired in June 1998, Applicant \nused his U.S. passport when he traveled to Turkey. (Item 5; Item 6.) \n \nIn order to maintain his Turkish citizenship, Applicant is required to serve in the \nTurkish military or pay a fee. He has no intent to serve in the Turkish military and is \nwilling to renounce his Turkish citizenship. His first priority is to the U.S. and protecting \nthe national security of the U.S. (Item 3, Item 5.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and step-father are dual citizens of Turkey and the U.S., who \ncurrently reside in the U.S. His parents-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens of and \nreside in Turkey. He also has extended relatives (aunts, uncles, cousins) who are \ncitizens of and reside in Turkey. (Item 3; Item 5.) Applicant claims none of his family \nmembers, including his in-laws, have any contact with government officials aside from   \neach males having to fulfill their military service obligation when they were young. His \nfather-in-law owns an engineering and consulting services company, and a company \nthat exports natural stone, such as marble, from Turkey. (Item 3; Item 5.)  \n \nWhen Applicant was a child, his mother purchased a single unit in an apartment \nbuilding in Turkey. She put his name on the deed. His mother uses and has control over \nthe apartment. He has no financial interest in the apartment. He asked his mother to \nremove his name from the deed. The apartment is worth $60,000. (Item 3; Item 5) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law listed Applicant as a shareholder on one of his \nbusinesses. Applicant did not purchase the shares. His father-in-law purchased the \nshares. Applicant signed a power of attorney for his father-in-law to act on his behalf \nduring share holder meetings. Applicant has no vested interest in the company. He \nrequested his father-in-law remove his name as a shareholder. Applicant has \napproximately $370,000 in assets located in the U.S. (Item 3; Item 5.)   \n \nApplicant visited family members in Turkey on a yearly basis from 1998 through \n2004. He did not travel to Turkey in 2005 or 2006. He traveled to Turkey in 2007. (Item \n3; Item 6.) Applicant has sponsored his parents-in-law, his brother-in-law, two cousins \nand several friends when they traveled to the U.S. for visits and vacation. (Item 5.)  \n \n Applicant visits with his mother and step-father on average of 20 times per \nmonth via telephone and in person. They reside in the U.S.  He contacts his parents-in-\nlaw and brother-in-law several times a year. He and his wife visit with them about once \na year. They travel to Turkey or his parents-in-law visit him and his family in the U.S.  \nHe has contact with his extended relatives (aunts, uncles, and cousins) when he and his \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwife visit Turkey. At least once a year, he may speak with extended relatives on the \ntelephone as well. (Item 5; Item 6.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise \nsecurity concerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a) (exercise \nof any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport) applies. Applicant possessed a valid Turkish \npassport from June 1972 through June 1998. He used his Turkish passport in lieu of his \nU.S. passport when he traveled to Turkey in July 1988, July 1990, and July 1992. \nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of a Turkish passport is considered an exercise of his \nrights of foreign citizenship and raises a security concern under foreign preference.    \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Preference. The following Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions \n(FP MC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in \na foreign country) applies. While Applicant was born in the United States, his parents \nwere Turkish citizens. They completed Applicant\u2019s Turkish citizenship paperwork when \nhe was a child. They also applied for a Turkish passport for him.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship) applies. Applicant states that he is willing to renounce his Turkish \ncitizenship.   \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual \nwas a minor) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s parents submitted his application for Turkish \ncitizenship and applied for his Turkish passport when he was a child.  However, he \ntraveled on his Turkish passport after becoming an adult so FP MC \u00b6 11 (c) only \npartially applies.   \nFP MC \u00b6 11(d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority) is not applicable to the facts of this case.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n FP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies. Applicant has not possessed a valid \nTurkish passport since June 1998. He has traveled using his U.S. passport when \nvisiting family members in Turkey since that time.     \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(f) (the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United \nStates Government) is not applicable because there is nothing in the record evidence \nsuggesting Applicant voted in a foreign election.  \n \nApplicant mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns. While a dual U.S. and \nTurkish citizen, he was born and raised in the U.S. His Turkish passport has been \nexpired for over ten years. He is willing to renounce his Turkish citizenship. Although he \nhas family ties in Turkey, he has lived in the U.S. his entire life. Guideline C is found for \nApplicant. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following \npotentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in \nTurkey. His parents-in-law, brother-in-law and members of his extended family \nconsisting of uncles, aunts and cousins are citizens of and reside in Turkey. He has  \ntraveled on numerous occasions to visit family members in Turkey. Applicant\u2019s \nnumerous visits to Turkey to visit family members create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, manipulation and inducement. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup or country by providing that information) applies for the same reason.  Applicant \nhas close contact with his family members, including his in-laws who reside in Turkey. \nHis close ties to his relatives in Turkey is evident based on his numerous visits to \nTureky. With regard to his parents-in-law, there is a rebuttable presumption that an \napplicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his spouse\u2019s immediate family \nmembers. (ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (Appeal Board, February 20, 2002))  \n \nFI DC & 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion) potentially applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s wife \nbecause she is not a U.S. citizen.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and stepfather are dual citizens of the Turkey and the U.S. \nThey reside in the U.S. I find no foreign influence concerns with respect to Applicant\u2019s \nmother and stepfather. SOR \u00b6 1.c is found for Applicant.  \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation) applies with respect to \nthe apartment that he owns in Turkey, and his status as a shareholder in a Turkish \ncompany owned by his father-in-law.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Influence.  The following Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions \n(FI MC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.) applies. Family contacts and ties with persons in a foreign \ncountry are not automatically disqualifying but require the applicant to present evidence \nin mitigation and extenuation that he qualifies for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s ties to \nhis relatives in Turkey are based on familial relationships. None of his family members \nwho are citizens of and reside in Turkey are connected with the Turkish government. It \nis unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of his foreign family members and the interests of the U.S.  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) applies. Applicant clearly has a sense of loyalty and obligation to his \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfamily members in Turkey. However, Applicant was born and raised in the U.S. His \nmost significant family members, his wife and mother, reside in the U.S. While Applicant \ntravels to Turkey to visit his family members, his longstanding ties in the U.S. support \nthat premise that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. \ninterest. \n  \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation) is not applicable.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family members who live \nand reside in Turkey cannot be considered casual and infrequent.  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual) applies. When \nApplicant was a child, his mother purchased an apartment in Turkey. She listed \nApplicant\u2019s name on the deed. She uses the apartment when she travels to Turkey. It is \nworth approximately $60,000. Applicant has no financial interest in the property. He \nasked his mother to remove his name from ownership of the apartment. Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law listed Applicant\u2019s name as a shareholder in a company he owns in Turkey. \nApplicant is a passive shareholder. He provided no money towards purchasing these \nshares and has no vested interest as a shareholder. He asked his father-in-law to \nremove him as a shareholder. All of Applicant\u2019s other investments are located in the \nU.S.  The total value of his U.S. assets is approximately $370,000. Neither of these \nfinancial interests are likely to result in a conflict.  Due to his lack of a financial stake in \neither interest, they are unlikely to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant.  \n \nForeign Influence concerns are mitigated based on Applicant\u2019s longstanding ties \nto the U.S. Guideline B is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While security concerns were raised  \ndue to Applicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in Turkey and two financial \ninterests in Turkey, the concerns have been mitigated based on Applicant\u2019s \nlongstanding ties to the U.S, and his lack of financial involvement towards the two \nfinancial interests in Turkey. His willingness to remove his name from each financial \ninterest shows that he cannot be influenced by either interest. While Applicant traveled \nto Turkey in the past using a Turkish passport, he has not possessed a valid Turkish \npassport in over ten years and is willing to renounce his Turkish citizenship. Applicant \nmitigated the concerns raised under foreign influence and foreign preference.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \nNovember 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 29, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. On May 4, 2009, DOHA \nreceived his response. On July 14, 2009, Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed, and I received the case assignment on July 16, 2009. On July 28, 2009, \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for August 25, 2009. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nreceived without objection. I held the record open until September 11, 2009, to afford \nthe Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted \nAE B through E, which were received without objection. On September 1, 2009, DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations with explanations. Applicant testified \nat his hearing and I found his testimony credible. After a complete and thorough review \nof the evidence, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old technical manager who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since August 2006. GE 1, Tr. 38. He supervises nine developers and \ndescribes himself as the \u201csenior architect.\u201d Tr. 63-64. Applicant seeks a security \nclearance as a first-time applicant to enhance his position within his company. Tr. 39. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1988. Following high school, he \npursued his education and graduated from college in May 1994 with a Bachelor of \nScience degree in Natural Resource Management. He continued his studies as a \ngraduate student until August 1997, and completed all of his course work for a Master\u2019s \nDegree in Geographic Information Systems, but did not complete or defend his thesis. \nGE 1, Tr. 35-37. Applicant married in September 1997, and has a nine-year-old \ndaughter and a five-year-old son. GE 1, Tr. 38-39. \n \nApplicant has never been charged with any felony, firearms, or explosives \noffenses. He has not been charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type, non-traffic-\nrelated offenses. He has not had any debts delinquent over 180 days, bankruptcy \npetitions, unpaid judgments, or unpaid liens. Apart from his self-disclosure of drug and \nalcohol abuse discussed infra, the case file contains no derogatory information about \nthe Applicant. GE 1 \u2013 GE 3. \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nPersonal Conduct (falsification concerns)2 \n \n \nThe security concerns alleged in the SOR center on Applicant\u2019s purported \nsubmission of false information regarding his past drug use, or alternatively stated, his \nunderreported past drug use. In response to Section 24 on his April 2007 e-QIP, \nApplicant stated he had used cocaine on two occasions in May 2005. The SOR alleged \nthat he deliberately failed to disclose on that same e-QIP that he had used cocaine with \nvarying frequency between 2000 and 2005, and illegally used Xanax between 2001 and \n2003, by using the medication in dosages exceeding levels prescribed by his physician. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.)  \n \n \nAdditionally, when Application was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) in July 2007, he is purported to have deliberately \nfalsified material facts to the Special Agent when he stated that he had used cocaine on \ntwo occasions in May 2005. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \n \n \nDuring his OPM interview in July 2007, he revealed his use of Xanax, which was \nnot included in his April 2007 e-QIP. In his August 2008 Interrogatories, he provided a \nmore comprehensive answer regarding past cocaine use, which included varying use of \ncocaine from 2000 and 2005. GE 3, Tr. 29-32. This information conflicted with his e-QIP \nresponse and with what he is reported to have told the OPM Special Agent during his \nJuly 2007 interview. \n \n \nRegarding past cocaine use, Applicant stated in his February 2009 \nInterrogatories: \n \nI checked my copy of the original questionnaire. I did answer yes to 24A, \nhowever I overlooked the space below for details. Smaller print & I \nmissed. Accidental & not intentional. GE 3.  \n \nDuring his hearing testimony, he reiterated his Interrogatory response and added: \n \nIn regard to the Xanax, you know, this was so long ago that I don\u2019t \nremember, but, I mean, the way that I read this, I either just missed it, not \nintentionally, or I read this differently looking at illicit, illegal drugs. The \nXanax I had was a prescribed prescription, and I\u2019m not about to say that I \ndidn\u2019t abuse it because I did, and I was addicted to it. But I think at the \ntime I probably read this as a legal use, controlled substances, and I \nprobably \u2013 I either missed it or I considered the Xanax as it was a \n \n2 Identified security concerns were limited Applicant\u2019s alleged falsifications pertaining to past drug \nuse. Applicant successfully completed an intensive outpatient drug and alcohol outpatient treatment \nprogram from May 31, 2005 to July 20, 2005, and his aftercare continued to November 2005. His doctor \nrecommended that Applicant\u2019s outpatient treatment include attending a 12-step Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) program. Applicant did enroll in AA and regularly attends AA meetings. GE 3, AE E, Tr. 45-50. The \nrecord contains no evidence of any drug use after 2005. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nprescription I had from a doctor. I might have not put it on there because \nof that. Tr. 32. \n \nDuring his hearing testimony, he reiterated his Interrogatory response: \n \nIn regard to the, the cocaine use, like I said, I\u2019ve tried to be honest with \nthis whole process. And like I said, the notes I have, you know, I put that \non here. Obviously I, to me at least, I read that incorrectly, or I didn\u2019t put it \non there. And I do have on my notes, [OPM Agent] and I did discuss more \nthan just the two times that I did that.3 So it\u2019s possible that I just misread it. \nBut, again, I didn\u2019t intentionally do anything. \n \nFor me, one thing at looking at all these documents, you know, I\u2019m not \nproud of my past, and, you know, when I look at these documents and \nstuff I don\u2019t really see anything I would have to gain by saying I didn\u2019t do \nan illegal drug this many times versus I did it this many times, to me at \nleast. I mean, I\u2019ve been forthcoming about it, and if I\u2019ve done it twice, I \ndon\u2019t, it\u2019s pretty much as bad as doing it, you know, ten times, in my mind, \nmaybe not from the Government\u2019s point of view. \n \nBy my point is that, you know, I was told from the get go from several \npeople, you know, \u201cPut everything on there you did, and you\u2019ll likely get \nyour clearance on there, or be dishonest about something, you will not get \nit.\u201d And I would have been honest anyway, but through this whole process \nI put everything on there that I could think of. \n \nThe last thing I wanted to say in regard to that is, you know, if the \nGovernment asked me to get a check from the bank or something like \nthat, that I had a document, I could do that, but I don\u2019t have detailed \nrecords of my drug use, you know. So I tried to piece this together and, \nyou know, recollect it to the best of my abilities. And like I said, as far as \n[OPM Agent] goes, I did have that [with] her and I discussed that, and I \nthink I might have just read or misinterpreted it in the original application. \nTr. 33-34. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant submitted a reference letter from his supervisor. The supervisor stated \nthat she has known the Applicant since his initial employment with their company in \n2006. She has found Applicant to be \u201cdiligent, trustworthy, and honest in all his \nprofessional and personal dealings with employees, clients and subcontractors.\u201d AE D. \n \n3 During Applicant\u2019s testimony, he produced his handwritten notes from his July 2007 OPM \ninterview, which corroborated his version of past cocaine use. AE A, Tr. 50-58. The OPM Special Agent\u2019s \ntestimony revealed that she did not take a signed, sworn statement from Applicant, but rather prepared a \nsummary of her interview with Applicant. She added that she believed the Applicant was truthful during \nhis interview. Tr. 15-27.   \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nHis company\u2019s promotion letter announcing his current position of technical manager \nlauded his technical leadership in high profile projects. Applicant also submitted a \nperformance evaluation from his previous employer that reflected above average \nperformance. AE B. \n \nLastly, Applicant\u2019s AA sponsor submitted a letter stating that Applicant has been \n\u201cclean and sober\u201d and an active member of AA for over four years. He further stated \nthat Applicant has rebuilt his family, personal, and professional life and that Applicant is \nan honest and upstanding member of his community. AE E. \n \nApplicant testified that he spends most of his spare time with his children, and \nenjoys playing golf. Tr. 55-56. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security \nclearance application: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant submitted an e-QIP that asked questions about past drug \nuse. As noted supra, Applicant provided incorrect or incomplete answers regarding his \npast misuse of prescription drugs and cocaine use. In a July 2007 OPM interview, he \nwas cited for failing to disclose the full extent of his past cocaine use. During that \ninterview, he disclosed his past misuse of prescription drugs. In his August 2008 \nresponse to Interrogatories, he expanded on his past cocaine use. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n16(b) both apply because of the conflicting information he provided regarding the full \nextent of his past drug use. Further review is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n  \nApplicant credibly stated when he completed his e-QIP his failure to list the full \nextent of past cocaine use and his misuse of prescription drugs was unintentional. He \nstated when interviewed by the OPM investigator, it was his recollection that he did \ndiscuss his more comprehensive cocaine use. His interview notes corroborate his \nrecollection. It was also during this interview, he freely revealed his past misuse of \nprescription drugs. He explained that he did not keep records of past drug use and tried \nto answer the questions as truthfully and accurately as possible at the time. When he \ncompleted his Interrogatories in August 2008 and upon further reflection, he amended \nhis previous response regarding past cocaine use. \n \nHe was candid and forthright at his hearing about his past drug use. I conclude \nApplicant\u2019s alleged falsifications were not intentional. Although he provided incomplete \ninformation in his April 2007 e-QIP, AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies. The falsification allegations \nare not substantiated. I am satisfied he did not deliberately and intentionally fail to \ndisclose his past drug use on his e-QIP or during his OPM interview with intent to \ndeceive.4 I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the Findings section of this decision with respect to \nSOR \u00b6 1.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n \n4The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s conflicting versions of past drug use placed his credibility into \nquestion warranting further inquiry. The government relies on each applicant to \nthoroughly and accurately respond to questions asked. Information applicants provide \nform the basis to grant or deny security clearances. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide \naccurate and complete information required further costly and time consuming inquiries \nthat could have been avoided. Fortunately for Applicant, his lack of due diligence was \nnot imputed to be intentional or deliberate. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant \ngranting Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation(s). Applicant has achieved some important educational, employment, and \npersonal milestones, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He \nis a college graduate, who completed his course work for his master\u2019s degree. He was \nrecently promoted by his employer and is responsible for nine subordinates. Applicant is \nwell regarded by his employer. He has overcome alcohol addiction and drug abuse, and \nregularly attends AA meetings. Applicant is a dedicated and responsible husband and \nfather of two young children. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism, and \ntrustworthiness through his service to the Department of Defense as an employee of a \ndefense contractor.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.b.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 29, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 28, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Board cannot consider new information supplied by Applicant in his appeal brief which was not part of\n1\nthe record below.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant denied one of those three, a judgment, only as to the amount of the unpaid balance.  Another, he\n2\ntestified should have been paid by health insurance or medicaid.  The third he had paid off through the use of a credit\ncard.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nSpecifically, Applicant argues that the Judge committed a factual error in stating that\nApplicant had $40,000 in delinquent debt.  Applicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s decision was\nimproperly based in part on Applicant\u2019s filing for bankruptcy, and that the Judge should have applied\nmitigating conditions in Applicant\u2019s situation because he had discharged substantial amounts of debt\nand was working to accomplish that goal before he applied for a security clearance.   Applicant also\n1\npoints out that he has safeguarded \u201cconfidential and secret material\u201d for over nine years as a\nDepartment of Defense contractor.  Applicant\u2019s Brief at 2. \nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: The SOR allegations against\nApplicant include a 2002 bankruptcy, a judgment, and ten other delinquent debts.  In his response\nto the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the debts; he denied the judgment only because the balance\ndue is now much lower.  Applicant has significant debt which is not listed in the SOR.  This includes\npersonal loans at high interest rates and money owed to the Internal Revenue Service.  Applicant\nfiled for bankruptcy shortly after he bought a house in 1999, because he and his wife separated and\nhe could no longer afford the payments.  His delinquencies were caused in part by his lack of\norganization; he put unpaid bills in a box and forgot about them.  Applicant received financial\ncounseling in the past, but stopped working with the company because he paid a high fee and no\nmoney was being applied to his debts.  He began to receive financial counseling with another\norganization  four days before the hearing.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant was supporting his\nson and others.\nIn his response to the government\u2019s SOR, Applicant admitted all but three of the allegations.2\nHis admissions established the government\u2019s case.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts he admitted.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain\na favorable security clearance decision rested with Applicant.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant\ntestified as to the origin of his financial difficulties.  In his testimony, he also identified significant\ndebt not listed in the SOR, including several high-interest personal loans known as \u201cpayday loans\u201d\nand amounts owed to the IRS.  Applicant testified that he was paying his current obligations in a\ntimely manner.  He also noted that at the time of the hearing he was paying off the high-interest\npersonal loans and had signed a credit counseling agreement with the YWCA four days before the\nhearing. \nIn her decision, the Judge referred to Applicant\u2019s testimony and found in Applicant\u2019s favor\nas to five of the debts listed in the SOR.  The Judge discussed the possible application of mitigating\nconditions in Applicant\u2019s case and explained why the mitigating evidence Applicant provided was\nnot sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Applicant contends that the Judge\n\ndid not give sufficient weight to his mitigating evidence.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  The record\nsupports the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s attempts to reduce his debt.\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s allegation of factual error, Applicant testified that at the time of\nthe hearing he had about $40,000 in total debt.  Transcript at 64.  A large portion of that amount was\nnot delinquent.  Transcript at 64-69.  The Judge erred in stating that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt\ntotaled $40,000.  However, that error is harmless, since the Judge reasonably explained the basis for\nher decision apart from that erroneous figure.\nApplicant contends that the Judge improperly based her decision in part on Applicant\u2019s filing\nfor bankruptcy.  Although filing for bankruptcy was a legally available option for Applicant to\nexercise in 2002, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to take the\nbankruptcy into account when evaluating Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances under Guideline\nF.  The government is not precluded from considering the negative security implications of an\napplicant\u2019s overall history of financial difficulties merely because the applicant exercises the right\nto seek a discharge of debts in bankruptcy.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-27082 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug.\n5, 2003).\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s argument that he safeguarded \u201cconfidential and secret material\u201d\nfor over nine years as a Department of Defense contractor, the government need not wait until an\nindividual mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert.\ndenied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An unfavorable security clearance decision can be based on\ncircumstances that raise security concerns sufficient to preclude a determination that it is clearly\nconsistently with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for a given applicant.\nSee Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  A history of financial problems\nis a circumstance that raises security concerns.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd.\nNov. 17, 2004).  In light of the record here, the Board concludes that the Judge had a rational basis\nfor concluding that Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties raised such concerns and that\nApplicant did not present evidence sufficient to extenuate or mitigate those concerns.  The Judge\u2019s\ndecision is sustainable.\n\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett          \nJeffrey D.

Based upon a review of the record,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 13, 2008, Applicant denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.l, of the SOR because the debts were paid or he had no\nknowledge of them. He admitted the other allegations in the SOR. He provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1974, and attended college for two years. He married in 1990, and has\nthree children from his marriage. Applicant and his wife separated in 1999, but are not\ndivorced. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1978 until 1979. He has been employed\nwith his current employer doing general maintenance since April 2007 (GE 1).\nPrior to his current employment, Applicant worked for the same company from\n1999 until 2007, earning a low hourly wage for many years. He was making $15 an hour\nwhen he left for a better position. As a single dad for nine years, he provides for his son\nwho still lives with him. He admits that he was not always as organized with his finances\nas he could have been (Tr. 35).     \nIn 1996, applicant fell at work. He ruptured a disk in his neck. As a result of the\nwork-related accident, he received a monetary settlement of approximately $85,000 in\n1999. He used $30,000 of that amount for a down payment for a home. He also bought\na truck because he needed a reliable vehicle (Tr. 43).\nApplicant explained that his finances became an issue because he did not have a\ngood filing system. He would pay bills that he thought were due and owing. He also\nadmitted being financially irresponsible (Tr. 36). He put bills in a box and when he\nmoved he forgot about them.\nThe SOR alleges twelve delinquent debts including, a 2002 bankruptcy, one\njudgment, and ten collection accounts. The total amount of the delinquent debt is\napproximately $40,000.\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a bankruptcy filed in July 2002 and discharged in October 2002.\nAt the hearing, Applicant acknowledged he filed bankruptcy because he purchased a\nhome in 1999 and then he and his wife separated. He could not afford the payments.\nHe also had some medical expenses from emergency room visits because he had no\nhealth insurance. Applicant had some high interest loans and car loans included in the\nbankruptcy (Tr. 39). The amount discharged was approximately $90,000.\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for judgment entered against him in the amount of $12,039. He\ndenied this because the amount is not correct. He acknowledges that this is the result of\na car loan that was in default. He had been paying an involuntary garnishment through\n\n3\nhis previous employer sine 2006. He is now paying a collection agency directly. The\nbalance is $7,263 (Tr. 31).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a collection account in the amount of $463. Applicant admitted this\ndebt in his answer to the SOR. Applicant is now disputing the amount. He wants a\ndetailed billing because he believes $200 of this amount is for an early disconnection\nfee that he does not owe (Tr. 25).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a charged-off account in the amount of $2,016. Applicant\nbelieved this amount stems from moving out early from a rental apartment. He plans to\ninclude this in a debt management plan (Tr. 26)\nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a collection account in the amount of $368. Applicant intends to\ninclude this in a debt management plan (AE C). \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a collection account in 2004 for the amount of $44. Applicant\nadmits this bill. He paid the account in 2008 (AE A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a collection account (medical) in the amount of $581. He denied\nthis bill. Applicant does not have any knowledge of this account (Tr. ). He called the\ncredit collection company, but he does not have any documentation that he disputed the\namount ( Tr.91 ). \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. is another collection account in the amount of $146. Applicant paid\nthe account in May 2008.\nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a collection account in the amount of $1,618. Applicant admits this\naccount, but believes that his medical insurance was responsible for paying it (Tr. 28).\nHe will include this in a debt management plan if the insurance does not pay the amount\n(Tr. 28).\nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a collection account in the amount of $286 for a utility account.\nApplicant paid this bill through the use of another credit card in May 2008 (Tr. 52).\nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a collection account in the amount of $1,192. Applicant admits this\ndebt and plans to include it in his debt management plan.\nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a collection account in the amount of $290. Applicant paid this\nrecently by using another credit card (Tr. 52).\nApplicant has four personal loans from 2008 totaling approximately $1,500 (Tr.\n58). He pays a total of $447 on those loans each month ( Tr. 59). Applicant stated he\nran short of money and used the loans to help him with his expenses. He also helps his\n22-year-old son and his friends. His son does not work at this time. His daughter\u2019s\nboyfriend came to live with him because he needed a place to live. He acknowledges\nthat he helps a lot of people often at his own expense (Tr. 64).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $3,250. After monthly expenses and\ndebt payments, he has approximately $2 net remainder. He is currently making\nminimum payments on other credit cards for a total of $457 (AE C). He is current with\nhis two car payments. He has no bank savings. He is also paying on back taxes to the\nIRS ($1,800) (Tr. 71).\nApplicant received financial counseling on September 18, 2008. He met with a\ncredit counselor to review his debts and credit issues. He set up a household budget.\nHe is in the process of contacting his creditors to establish a debt repayment plan. Prior\nto September, he went to a debt consolidation group. He paid a high fee and no money\nwas being applied to his creditors. He stopped working with them (Tr. 76). He is working\na part-time job and plans to use the extra income to increase the amount that can be\nallocated for each debt (AE C).\nApplicant is recommended for his dependability and work ethic. He is trustworthy\nand committed to every project on which he works. He is very responsible. He\nvolunteers for community and service activities. He is conscientious and is\nrecommended for a security clearance by his long time associates (AE D).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n5\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and has current delinquent\ndebts and a judgment from 2006. Despite paying debts with a settlement in 1999 and\nhaving $90,000 in debts discharged in bankruptcy, he can not meet his financial\nobligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\n\n6\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries continue. He has personal loans from 2008 in addition to\nthe delinquent debts. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, his\nfinancial problems may have begun with his separation, but the inquiry does not end\nthere. He eliminated debts in 2002 through bankruptcy. However, he has incurred more\nunpaid debts. Applicant did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts.\nHe did not take a stance until he learned about the security clearance process. I find\nthis potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did receive financial counseling. He\nestablished a budget and has plans for a debt management plan. He has paid several\nsmall debts. However, he used another credit card to pay for one of those debts. He\ntook out four small personal loans in 2008 to cover his expenses and debt. This\nmitigating condition partially applies. \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\u2019s problems\nwere caused by an admitted inattention to his financial affairs. He did not actively\npursue any of the credit collection accounts until the security clearance process started.\nI conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that the alleged\ndebt in the SOR concerning a medical account and a collection account for an early\ndeparture from a rental are disputed. However, he did not produce any documentation\nto support this belief. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n7\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that under the whole\nperson, there is not sufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant is a hard worker. He has supported his family for many years. His son\nis not working and is living at home. Applicant supports him and his friends. Applicant\nmade a low hourly wage for many years. He bought a house, but had to file for\nbankruptcy in 2002 because he could not make the payments on the house and had\nother loans. The marital separation was a contributing factor to his inability to pay his\nexpenses. However, he received a settlement in 1999 and could only account for part of\nthe $85,000. \nApplicant admitted that he has been financially irresponsible. He has only\nrecently sought financial counseling. He has continued to take out small personal loans\nat a high interest rate to make ends meet. He owes the IRS in back taxes. He is still\npaying on a judgment from 2006. He does have a budget, but has no real net monthly\nremainder. The debt management or repayment plan has not started, and it is not clear\nthat Applicant has the financial ability to maintain such a plan. He has not produced\nsufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 12, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 9, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 19, 2008, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on January 6, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were received without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nFebruary 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \ncalled one witness, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through M, which were received \nwithout objections. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit \nadditional information. Applicant submitted 26 pages of documents, which were marked \nAE N through R, and admitted without objections. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is \nmarked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJanuary 26, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has an \nassociate\u2019s degree. He served in the U.S. Army from 1978 until he accepted early \nretirement in 1995. He was married from 1980 to 1992. He is currently married, having \nremarried in 1994. He has no children, but has four adult stepchildren, ages 29 to 34.1  \n \n \nApplicant has had financial difficulties for a number of years. He was laid off work \nin 2002, and was unemployed for about a year. His wife also lost her job in 2002, and \nremained unemployed through 2006. She again lost her job in 2007, and is still \nunemployed. Applicant attempted to start his own business after he lost his job. He ran \nthe business from 2002 through 2004.

He has deployed \nto Iraq on several occasions for his current employer.2 \n \nThe SOR lists seven delinquent debts. Applicant did not specifically admit or \ndeny the allegations in his response to the SOR, but he discussed his efforts to address \nhis financial problems. Individual debts and Applicant\u2019s actions are addressed below. \nHe also received financial counseling through his church.3  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent debt of $1,929 to a collection company, collecting \non behalf of a cellular telephone services provider. The debt is listed on the two credit \nreports in evidence. Applicant let his adult stepdaughter use the cell phone and the bills \nwent unpaid. He stated that he went to the services provider to attempt to resolve the \ndebt, but they told him that their record did not show him with an account in their \nsystem, apparently because it was transferred or sold to the collection company. The \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 61-64; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 30, 34, 67-68; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 60. \n\n \n3 \n \ncredit reports obtained by the Government and submitted in evidence provide almost no \ninformation about the identity of the collection company.4 \n \n \nA delinquent debt of $150 to a medical provider is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The \nname of the creditor is not provided in the allegation and it is not listed on the credit \nreports in evidence. Applicant provided documentation that he paid several medical \ndebts. This debt is considered resolved.5 \n \n \nApplicant voluntarily returned a car and a truck to the financial institutions that \nheld his loans after he became unemployed. The credit reports in evidence list the \nbalance owed on the loan on the car at $13,178, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. It is unclear \nfrom the reports whether this figure reflects the amount owed on the loan at the time of \nthe voluntary repossession, or if it reflects the deficiency balance owed on the car after \nit was sold at auction. Applicant testified that the bank sent him a letter some time after \nthe car was returned advising him that he owed about $13,000. The debt for the truck \nloan is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, as owed to a collection company. Applicant admitted that \nthe holder of the truck loan sent him a bill for $10,615 after the truck was returned. This \ndebt is not listed on the credit reports in evidence. Applicant stated that he will initiate \ncontact with whoever holds this debt to attempt to resolve the debt.6 \n \n \nApplicant fell seriously behind on his mortgage payments, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. In November 2007, he owed $19,752 in arrears. He entered into a stipulated \nrepayment plan agreement with the mortgage company. He agreed to make payments \nof $2,967 every month, starting on December 15, 2007, and ending on February 15, \n2009. The payments of $2,967 included $1,650 to the loan and $1,317 to the arrears. \nApplicant made all the payments to the mortgage company\u2019s satisfaction and the \nmortgage is now considered current.7  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a delinquent debt of $804 to a credit card company. The debt \nis not listed on the two credit reports in evidence. Applicant submitted a letter from the \ncompany that listed a balance on the account of $998.38 as of January 6, 2009. \nApplicant handwrote on the letter the figure $332.79. This figure represents one third of \nthe amount owed. Applicant paid the creditor $332.79 on January 8, 2009. Applicant did \nnot submit documentation or otherwise indicate that this was a settlement of the debt.8 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the delinquent debt of $1,133 to a collection \ncompany on behalf of a credit card company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. When Applicant \nresponded to DOHA interrogatories, he submitted a letter dated April 28, 2008, from \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 38-40, 45-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE G. \n \n5 Tr. at 47; AE E, F. \n \n6 Tr. at 31-33, 47-50, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A. \n \n7 Tr. at 37-38, 50-53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE A-C, H, R. \n \n8 Tr. at 39-44, 53-54; AE P. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nanother collection company. The letter listed the balance on the debt at $1,326. The \ncompany indicated that it would accept $828 in settlement of the debt. Applicant \nhandwrote on the document that he called the company to make payment \narrangements on the debt. Applicant did not make any payments before the hearing. He \nentered into a settlement agreement with the company on January 5, 2009, wherein the \nbalance of $1,373 would be settled by a payment of $300 by January 10, 2009, followed \nby a $798 payment on February 10, 2009. Applicant made the $300 payment on \nJanuary 8, 2008.9 \n \nApplicant has had tax problems for many years. He stated his tax problems \nresulted from his first marriage. However, that marriage ended in 1994, and he \ncontinued to have tax problems for years thereafter. He entered into an agreement with \nthe IRS in August 2007, to pay $750 per month for his and his current wife\u2019s back taxes \nfor tax years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2005. He attempted to have the \nIRS remove his wife\u2019s name from the tax debt. He submitted documentation that he \nmade all 12 monthly payments in 2008. His monthly IRS statement of April 9, 2008, \nreflected balances for the joint account of $14,169 for tax year 1997; $11,988 for 1999; \n$4,023 for 2000; and $9,580 for other periods. The total amount owed to the IRS from \nthat statement was $39,760. The IRS applied $9,229 from his wife\u2019s 2007 refund for \ntheir 1999 tax debt. The IRS notice of May 12, 2008, reflected a balance of $2,759 for \ntax year 1999, after the $9,229 was applied. Taking into account the amount the IRS \napplied from the 2007 tax year refund and Applicant\u2019s additional payments of $750 each \nmonth, Applicant and his wife\u2019s current tax debt to the IRS is estimated at about \n$23,781.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 39-44, 53-56; GE 2; AE J, O. \n \n10 Tr. at 62-67, 73-74; GE 2; AE A, K, Q; Applicant\u2019s tax debts were not alleged as a basis for the \ndenial of his security clearance in the SOR and will not be used for disqualification purposes. The tax \ndebts will be considered in the application of mitigating conditions and in analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes a substantial amount of money on debts alleged in the SOR. \nHis financial problems are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. He \nattributed his financial problems to his and his wife\u2019s unemployment. He also lost \n$40,000 in income as a subcontractor when his company was not paid on a contract. \nThese are conditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully applicable, there \nmust be a correlation between the unforeseen circumstances and the person\u2019s current \nfinancial problems. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant\u2019s financial problems started long before he became \nunemployed in 2002. He stated that his tax problems were related to his first marriage \nwhich ended in 1992. IRS documents reflect delinquent taxes for tax years 1996, 1997, \n1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2005. To his credit, Applicant has been paying his back \ntaxes for more than a year and has been addressing other debts. However, he still owes \nthe IRS more than $22,000, in addition to his other unpaid delinquent debts. There is \n\n \n7 \n \ninsufficient information for a finding that he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.   \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling through his church. The payments of \nsome of his debts are indications that the problem is in the process of being resolved. \nBecause of the amount still owed, it has not yet reached the point of being a clear \nindication that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially \napplicable. Under the same rationale, he has not made sufficient payments on all his \ndebts to constitute a good-faith effort to repay all his overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is only applicable to his resolved debts. \n \nApplicant may have had difficulty in finding all the creditors holding his delinquent \ndebts, but he did not dispute owing any of the underlying debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not \napplicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s service to \nthis country in the U.S. Army, and I also considered his deployments to Iraq as a \ndefense contractor. However, his finances have been in disarray for a number of years. \nHis finances were clearly damaged by his and his wife\u2019s unemployment from 2002, and \nthe failure of his business. However, that does not explain his tax problems. He stated \nthat his tax problems resulted from his first marriage, but that marriage ended in 1994. \nIRS documents reflect delinquent taxes for seven tax years between 1996 and 2005. \nHis tax liability at one point was more than $40,000. After his regular payments and the \nwithholding of his wife\u2019s refund for tax year 2007, the current federal tax debt is still \nmore than $22,000. He also still owes a large amount on the debts in the SOR, as \n\n \n8 \n \naddressed above. His ongoing financial issues cause me to question his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn June 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 14, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on September 8, \n2008. Applicant works and lives overseas. After coordination with Applicant and \nDepartment Counsel, DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 2, 2008, scheduling \nNovember 13, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nthe hearing for October 23, 2008, by video teleconference (VTC). I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A through C, which were received without objections. I granted Applicant\u2019s request \nto keep the record open to submit additional information. Applicant submitted 15 pages \nof documents, marked collectively as AE D, and admitted without objections. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 31, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked on a \nU.S. military installation overseas since 2005. His home, when he is not working on the \nmilitary installation, is in another foreign country. Applicant retired from the United \nStates Army as a Sergeant First Class in 1985, after 24 years of active duty. He was in \nthe Special Forces and served four years in Vietnam and other foreign countries. He \nwas awarded numerous medals and commendations, including the Vietnam Cross of \nGallantry with Palm, Combat Infantry Badge, and Purple Heart. He was married and \ndivorced, and is currently married with two children, ages 16 and 15.1 \n \n \nThe SOR lists two delinquent debts. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a debt of $13,581 to a \ncollection company on behalf of a credit card company. The debt is listed on the credit \nreport of June 5, 2008. Applicant admitted to having an account with the credit card \ncompany with a balance of about $3,500. He stated that he purchased an insurance \nprotection policy from the credit card company that would pay his balance if he were \nunemployed for 90 days or longer. He was unemployed for about six months in 2002 to \n2003. He honestly thought that the balance was paid by his insurance policy. When \nApplicant learned that the policy placed his payments on hold, but did not cancel the \ndebt, he indicated that he would settle the debt. In his post-hearing submission, \nApplicant stated that he reached a settlement agreement with the collection company. \nThe company attempted to send the agreement to him by facsimile, but was unable to \nmake the connection with his overseas location. The company is mailing it to him, but it \nwas not received by the close of the record.2  \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a debt of $3,099 to a credit union. Applicant was unaware of \nthis debt until he received Interrogatories from DOHA in March 2008. At that time, \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 53-59; GE 1, 2; AE A. \n \n2 Tr. at 27-52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE C, D. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant owed the credit union $3,599 plus an additional $875 on a separate account. \nThe debts were incurred by Applicant\u2019s former spouse without his knowledge while they \nwere married but separated. He decided to pay the debts. He paid $875 on March 24, \n2008, and made arrangements to pay the $3,599 debt in monthly installments. He \nprovided documentation showing $500 payments on March 2, 2008, April 1, 2008, April \n26, 2008, May 31, 2008, and June 30, 2008; a $232 payment on July 28, 2008; and \n$550 payments on August 18, 2008 and September 9, 2008. The debt has been paid in \nfull.3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances are in very good shape. His credit report is clean except for \nthe debts discussed above. He has no other outstanding debts. The mortgage on the \nhouse he owns with his ex-wife in the United States was completely paid off in March \n2008.4  \n \n \nOn November 17, 2005, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) and certified that his answers were true. Question 28a asked, \n\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Question \n28b asked, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to both questions. Applicant honestly believed he was answering the SF 86 \ntruthfully because he was unaware of the debt to the credit union and he thought the \ndebt to the credit card was paid by the insurance protection policy.5 I find his \nexplanations credible. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 24-26, 60-62; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE B, D \n \n4 Tr. at 59-60; GE 2, 3; AE D.  \n \n5 Tr. at 24-27, 62-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had two delinquent debts. He was unaware of one and thought the \nother was paid by his insurance protection policy. The evidence is not sufficient to raise \nAG \u00b6 19(a) because there was never an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 19(c) is minimally raised because of the two debts.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe two delinquent debts occurred under very unusual circumstances. The debt \nto the credit union was incurred by Applicant\u2019s former spouse without his knowledge \nwhile they were married but separated. He was unaware of this debt until he received \nInterrogatories from DOHA in March 2008. Applicant started repaying the debt as soon \nas he became aware of it and made the last payment on September 9, 2008. He \nhonestly thought the debt to the credit card was paid by his insurance protection policy. \nApplicant was mistaken in his belief, but it was an honest mistake. Now that he is aware \nof the mistake, he has taken steps to resolve the issue. I find the behavior was so \ninfrequent and occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, \nwarranting the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a). He initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts and there are clear indications that the \n\n \n6 \n \nproblem is being resolved and is under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) are applicable to \nboth debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is also applicable to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, including AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant omitted information from his Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions; however, it was not an unintentional error and not a \ndeliberate omission. No Personal Conduct disqualifying condition is raised by the \nevidence. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.   \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served this country for 24 \n\n \n7 \n \nyears and retired as a Sergeant First Class. He was in the Special Forces, served four \nyears in Vietnam, and earned numerous medals and commendations, including the \nPurple Heart. The two debts in the SOR are aberrations. As soon as he found out about \nthe debt to the credit union, he began repaying it. He only arrived at the conclusion that \nhe is liable for the debt to the credit card company at the hearing. He then made \narrangements to resolve the debt. His finances are otherwise in great shape. He \nrecently paid off a mortgage and has no other debts.  \n      \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on December 20,\n2006. On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant submitted his undated answer to the SOR. There is no date stamp on\nhis answer to reveal when the answer was received by DOHA. Then, he submitted the\nthird page of the SOR with his signature and a notary stamp. However, the notary did\nnot furnish the date when the document was notarized. Notwithstanding the lack of date\non his answer, I am certain Applicant provided the two page answer containing his\nhandwritten responses to each SOR allegation. His handwritten denials to SOR\nJanuary 23, 2009\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nallegations 1.b., 1.g., and 1.j. were substantiated by his testimony. Applicant established\nthrough his testimony that he was aware of and admitted most of the allegations, as\nevidenced by the documentation provided to address SOR 1.a. and his post hearing\ndocumentation. I accept his answer. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 7, 2008, and the hearing was held\non October 30, 2008. At the hearing, six exhibits (GE 1 through 6) were admitted in\nevidence without objection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant  testified and\nsubmitted one exhibit (AE A). In the time allowed for Applicant to furnish additional\ndocumentation, he submitted AE B through AE I. These exhibits contain updated\npayment information. DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the proceedings on\nNovember 6, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges 13 debts (eleven delinquent debts and two judgments) totaling\n$23,063.00. The debts converted to delinquent status between 2002 and 2006.\nApplicant denied subparagraphs 1.b., 1.g., and 1.j. He admitted the other nine debts.\nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.d. appear to be the same debt. However, the credit reports\ndo not show SOR 1g. and 1.j. as the same debt because the account numbers differ. \nApplicant is 41 years old and single. He has worked as a software developer for\nhis present employer since June 2006. In that position, Applicant develops database\napplications for the military. He seeks a secret security clearance.\nApplicant testified his financial problems occurred for three reasons: (1) a layoff\nbetween March and June 2006 (Tr. 30); (2) moving from state to state for employment\nand forgetting about accounts that he opened at his previous location (Tr. 40); and, (3)\nhelping his family financially (Tr. 47). In March 2006, Applicant was laid off from a\nposition in another state, and did not find employment in the local area until June 2006.\nDuring the first month of the layoff, Applicant was able to pay bills as he received at\nleast one more pay check in March 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s employment over the years has taken him to different parts of the\nUnited States (U.S.) When he departed one location, he forgot about some the\naccounts he had opened, and did not return to satisfy the account (Tr. 40; GE 1).\nThe third reason Applicant encountered financial troubles was in supporting the\nmonetary needs of his family. During his layoff in March 2006, Applicant exhausted his\nretirement account of $8,000.00 for family needs (Tr. 47). \nSOR 1.a. (same debt as SOR 1.d.) A judgment was entered against Applicant in\nOctober 2007 for $6,920.00, for failure to meet installment payments on a credit card\naccount. AE A reflects a payment agreement was reached with Applicant paying\n$250.00 a month on the judgment, beginning in October 2007. On November 4, 2008,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nApplicant had paid $3,500.00, leaving a balance of $5,057.00 (AE D). His sustained\ninvolvement in a payment plan results in finding in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR 1.b. A judgment of $913.00 was entered against Applicant in January 2004\nfor failing to pay rent. Because he did not leave the apartment until he June 2006, he\nopined that the rental company simply reported the failure to pay rent to the court and\nobtained a judgment of $913.00. He claims that he paid the rent, however, the new\nrental agency could not reverse the action, although the reason Applicant provided is\nnot clear. He claims the new rental agency advised him to come before a local judge\nand have the judgment removed (Tr. 34). I find against Applicant.  \nSOR 1.c. Applicant purchased $95.00 in food from a supermarket in March 2004\nwith a worthless check. On November 3, 2008, Applicant paid this delinquent debt by\ncheck card (AE C). Applicant\u2019s belated action still results in a finding in his favor. \nSOR 1.d. This account is the same as SOR 1.a. I find for Applicant.\nSOR 1.e. This telecommunications account for $234.00 was paid off by Applicant\non November 3, 2008 by check card (AE I). This account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor. \nSOR 1.f. This telecommunications account of $138.00 was opened in February\n2002, with the last activity on the account occurring in February 2004 (GE 6). Applicant\npaid the account on November 3, 2008 (AE H). Applicant receives a favorable finding\nfor this account. \nSOR 1.g. This credit card account is delinquent in the amount of $2,061.00. The\nlast activity on the account was 2002. Applicant received a letter from the creditor on\nOctober 31, 2008 indicating the account was paid in full. However, there is no indication\nof what amount Applicant paid and when he paid it. The check card payment\ndocumentation is not helpful because it does not identify which creditors received\npayments. I assume that Applicant settled the debt for less than the full amount.\nNonetheless, this account is resolved in his favor. \nSOR 1.h. The delinquent account is $252.00, and according to GE 6, Applicant\npurchased some jewelry in August 2003 that he did not pay for. SOR 1.h. is found\nagainst Applicant. \nSOR 1.i. The account ($1,736.00) was opened in 1995, with the last activity on\nthe account occurring in 2002. Applicant forgot about the account (Tr. 38). This account\nis resolved against Applicant.\nSOR 1.j. This credit card account has a delinquent amount of $2,253.00. The last\nactivity for this credit card account is the same as the account in SOR 1.g. Applicant\nrecalled he had only one account with this credit card company because the card is\nmade available for customers who have bad credit (Tr. 38). I am unable to find sufficient\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nsimilarities between SOR 1.g. and 1.j. to state they are the same accounts. I find\nApplicant owes this account. \nSOR 1.k. This professional services account of $122.00 was reported for\ncollection in February 2001. Applicant has taken no action on this account (Tr. 39). SOR\n1.k. is found against Applicant. \nSOR 1.l. The electronics account of $1,994.00 was opened in 1996, and\nApplicant\u2019s last payment on the account was June 2002. Applicant\u2019s claim he has not\nmade payments on this debt for years (Tr. 39) does not relieve him of responsibility for\nthe account. Applicant remains responsible for this delinquent debt. \nSOR 1.m. Applicant testified the $303.00 represents a car payment he neglected\nto pay when he was working in the upper northwest part of the United States (U.S.).\nApplicant provided no documentation to support his claim he returned to the location\nand donated the car to charity (Tr. 24). Applicant still is responsible for the account. \nApplicant\u2019s documentation shows he has paid or settled with the creditors in SOR\n1.a. (same as 1.d.), 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g. He still owes SOR creditors 1.b., 1.h., 1.i.,\n1.j., 1.k., 1.l., and 1.m. Applicant still owes $10,993.00 to seven creditors. \nApplicant has never had financial counseling. Except for SOR 1.a. and 1.g., he\ndid not try to pay the debts earlier because when he initially began his job in June 2006,\nhe did not need a security clearance, so he was not thinking about his bad credit (Tr.\n44). Applicant has been continuously employed since June 2006. He disclosed in\npersonal financial statement in March 2008 that he had about $3,458.00 in\ndiscretionary, monthly income remaining after payment of monthly expenses.\nIn addition to the listed debts, Applicant received a parking ticket in 2004 he did\nnot become aware of until recently. Because he did not pay the ticket in the time\nprovided to avoid interest and penalties being added to the ticket, he currently owes\nabout $900.00. He is paying about $200.00 a month to extinguish the fine (Tr. 42). He\nstill owes about $500.00 (Id.)\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no evidence from other individuals, e.g., coworkers or friends,\nto provide insight into his job performance and/or lifestyle away from work. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nFC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) is\nactivated by Applicant\u2019s inability to satisfy his delinquent debts. When the SOR was\npublished in June 2008, Applicant owed $17,143.00 to 12 creditors. The number of\ncreditors is reduced by one because SOR 1.d. appears to be the same account as SOR\n1.a. However, I am unable to conclude that SOR 1.g. is the same as SOR 1.j. FC DC\n19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) applies based on the fact that several\nof the debts have been designated delinquent for at least six years, exemplifying a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations. \nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that have potential application to this\ncase. FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) is not\napplicable even though several listed debts became delinquent over five years ago.\nApplicant\u2019s historic inattentiveness to his debts continues to raise doubts about his\nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control and individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies as a result of Applicant\u2019s layoff in March 2006. But, Applicant was still being paid\nin the first month of the layoff. Moreover, Applicant has been continuously employed\nsince June 2006. He disclosed in March 2008 that he had $3,458.00 of discretionary,\nmonthly income remaining after payment of his expenses. He could have used this\nmoney to pay several additional creditors. He did not. There were only two debts\nApplicant acted on in 2007. Applicant\u2019s efforts to repay the SOR 1.a. creditor were taken\nafter the creditor obtained judgment against him in October 2007. Applicant\u2019s payoff of\nthe SOR 1.g. creditor on November 30, 2007, occurred after the account had been\nassigned to a collection service. In sum, Applicant receives only limited mitigation under\nFC MC 20.b.\nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\nshall be discussed with FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) to determine their availability. Applicant\nhas never had financial counseling, and there is no indication he has his financial\nproblems under control. His payment of one creditor under a payment plan is favorable\nevidence. But, Applicant did not enter the payment plan until after a judgment had been\nobtained against him. His payment of four of the other creditors is favorable evidence.\nHowever, he did pay three of these creditors until after he was advised by the\ngovernment in March 2008 that he owed these debts. The fact that he has waited so\nlong to resolve five of his debts, while seven remain unresolved, raises residual\nconcerns his financial problems will continue. The FC guideline is found against\nApplicant. \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s\nlife, and a careful consideration of nine variables that comprise whole person model:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation and recurrence. \u00b6 2, p.18 of\nthe Directive.\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the general factors of the whole\nperson concept. Since October 2007 Applicant has paid five of 12 creditors\napproximately $6150.00 or about 64% of his total delinquent debt. But, to truly\ndemonstrate sound financial responsibility, an applicant should demonstrate more than\nsimply paying delinquent debts. He should also show that he knows how manage his\nfinancial obligations, including how to prevent current debts from becoming delinquent.\nNot remembering to pay bills, or forgetting about accounts, or simply disregarding a\njudgment altogether, as in SOR 1.b., continues to cast a pall over Applicant\u2019s judgment\nand reliability, and prompts the legitimate question of whether Applicant could adopt the\nsame irresponsible attitude toward security rules and regulations. Having weighed the\nwhole person factors in light of the evidence as a whole, Applicant has not presented\nsufficient evidence to conclude his security clearance application should be granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l\n.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nSamuel Bluck, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 15, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 23, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \n\nRegarding Guideline F, the Judge found that Applicant and two partners started a business\nin 1997 and obtained a $100,000 loan pursuant to a promissory note wherein the lender held a\nsecurity interest in the business\u2019s assets.  Applicant and other company officers executed documents\nguaranteeing the loan.  A second line of credit, also in the amount of $100,000, was also guaranteed\nby Applicant and the CEO.  Applicant was not involved in handling the finances of the business.\nHe invested some of his own assets in the business, and borrowed $27,000 from his brother to put\ninto the business.  Subsequently, the business failed.  The company offered its inventory as collateral\nto the banks when it could no longer make loan payments.  In 2000, both banks filed lawsuits against\nthe company and the loan guarantors.  In June 2000, one of the banks, Applicant, the CEO and the\ncompany stipulated to a Judgment of $116,418.  In the same month, the other lender obtained a\njudgment against Applicant for $112,130.  \nApplicant sold his residence and the $32,000 proceeds went to partially satisfy the $116,418\njudgment.  As of December 2005, the credit bureaus were reporting that one of the lenders had filed\nin court to attach Applicant\u2019s assets to recover a $120,000 debt balance.  In 2006 or 2007, after he\napplied for a security clearance, Applicant retained legal counsel to represent him in settling the\njudgment debts against him.  Settlement negotiations ensued, but no agreement was reached and, as\nof July 2009, Applicant had paid nothing toward the judgment debts.  Applicant believes that one\nof the creditors received proceeds from an auction of the inventory of the failed business, but there\nis no information available confirming his belief.  As of the summer of 2009, Applicant was making\nhis credit card account payments and his mortgage payments on time.  In July 2009, Applicant\nestimated his annual income at about $180,000.  He had available to him about $20,000 to $30,000\nin cash assets to pay the judgments.\nRegarding Guideline J, the Judge found that during the course of a lawsuit concerning the\nbusiness debts, Applicant was subpoenaed to testify in June 2001.  Applicant provided false\ntestimony under oath.  Applicant was subsequently indicted on three counts of perjury in October\n2001.  In March 2004, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of false swearing, a Class\nA misdemeanor.  After Applicant signed a form acknowledging that he understood he was admitting\nthe truth of the charges against him, a finding of guilty was entered for both counts.  Applicant\nunderwent a voluntary psychological evaluation in April 2009 by a clinical psychologist to determine\nwhether he exhibited clinical indicators of lying behavior.  The psychologist found no significant\nindication of lying behavior at the time of Applicant\u2019s testimony and opined that Applicant was not\ndeceptive.  Applicant was not willing to acknowledge at his July 2009 hearing that he had knowingly\nprovided false testimony in the lawsuit.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s two outstanding judgments raised security concerns\nunder Guideline F.  The Judge indicated that despite some matters in mitigation, she was unable to\nfully apply the Guideline F Mitigating Conditions.  This was because of Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\nirresponsibility in not making the restitution of the judgment debts a priority.  While one creditor\nmay have received some funds from the equity in Applicant\u2019s house in 2000 or 2001, no payments\non the debt have been made since then, and the other creditor has gone uncompensated.  Applicant\nmade no attempt to address the second judgment until 2006 or 2007, after he applied for his security\nclearance.  Despite having $20,000 to $30,000 cash on hand, there is some question as to whether\nApplicant has the means to satisfy the approximately $200,000 in outstanding judgments, given the\n\nfact that he has outstanding credit card balances totaling about $29,000.\nThe Judge concluded that the passage of eight years since the false swearing convictions is\na significant mitigating condition.  She also mentioned Applicant\u2019s character references and good\nemployment record.  However, this evidence in reform must be weighed against the seriousness of\nthe offense.  Although a misdemeanor under applicable state criminal statutes, a knowing false\nstatement made under oath raises very serious concerns about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  Concerns persist about Applicant\u2019s reform, given his inability to provide a\nconsistent, credible account of his conduct in June 2001.  Applicant also told one of the witnesses\ntestifying on his behalf at the hearing that the judgment debts had been repaid.  Under a whole-\nperson analysis, the Judge concluded that it would be premature to conclude that the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns are fully mitigated at this time.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding the unpaid judgments are not a\nsatisfactory articulation of financial responsibility.  Applicant argues that the Judge focuses too much\non the timeliness aspect of Applicant\u2019s debt resolution and has failed to articulate precisely how\nApplicant\u2019s behavior was deficient.  Applicant\u2019s claims do not establish harmful error on the part\nof the Judge.  The Board has reviewed the Judge\u2019s conclusions and finds that they are sufficiently\ndetailed and consistent with her findings of fact to support her adverse decision.  The Judge\nappropriately considered the length of time that passed before Applicant took any meaningful action\ntoward resolution of the outstanding judgments, as well as the fact that, as of the close of the hearing,\nmost of the debt was still outstanding.  The Judge also considered the amount of the unresolved debt.\nApplicant cites the Board\u2019s ruling in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) for\nthe proposition that the Judge erroneously concluded that he did not act reasonably under the\ncircumstances of this case, and did not do all he reasonably could to address his indebtedness.  After\nreview, the Board concludes that the case cited by Applicant is distinguishable from the instant case\non its facts, and does not contain any analysis or statement of law that renders the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions unsustainable.  \nApplicant argues that the case against him under Guideline J has been mitigated, principally\nthrough the passing of eight years since the offenses.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not establish error\non the part of the Judge.\n The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\n\nconditions and factors.  She discussed the applicability of Guideline J Mitigating Conditions and\ncogently explained why there was insufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns, stressing the fact that the nature of Applicant\u2019s criminal activity (lying under oath) relates\ndirectly to concerns about his judgment, trustworthiness and reliability.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nthe decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has not satisfied two judgment debts totaling $228,548 following a\nbusiness failure. In March 2004, he was convicted of two counts of false swearing in\ncourt testimony in June 2001. Financial and criminal conduct concerns are not\nmitigated. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 1, 2005. On January 15, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F and Guideline J that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOctober 23, 2009\n\n2\nOn March 2, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on May 15, 2009, to decide whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On\nJune 2, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for July 1, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Six government exhibits (Ex. 1-6) and 15\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-O) were admitted. Department Counsel objected to the\npsychological evaluation offered as Exhibit K on the bases of lack of relevance, lack of\nfoundation laid for expert opinion, and inability to examine the psychologist about his\nassessment. The report was admitted in full with the weight to be afforded the\ninformation therein subject to my evaluation of reliability, trustworthiness, and probity, in\nlight of the record as a whole.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that as of\nJune 11, 2008, Applicant owed two judgment debts of $112,130 (SOR 1.a) and\n$116,418 (SOR 1.b). Under Guideline J, criminal conduct, Applicant was alleged to\nhave been indicted in October 2001 on three counts of perjury, convicted in March 2004\nof two counts of false swearing, for which he was fined $1,000, and sentenced to 12\nmonths imprisonment on each count, sentence suspended for one year (SOR 2.a).\nApplicant denied the allegations. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old consultant, who has served as the storage area\nnetwork architect on a military combat information transport system program since\nOctober 2004 (Exs. 1, A-E). He is a partner with three others (one active) in a storage\narea network company that has a contract with a subcontractor on the program (Ex. B,\nTr. 42-43, 71). Applicant had worked for the subcontractor until he established his own\ncompany and the subcontractor contacted with him to provide consulting services on\nseveral military projects (Ex. H). Applicant seeks a security clearance under the\nsponsorship of the subcontractor.\nApplicant is a naturalized United States citizen, who came to the U.S. from Iran in\nearly 1978 on a student visa. After some studies in the English language, he pursued an\nassociate of science degree in computer science and engineering from 1978 to 1980\n(Ex. K). From about September 1980 to September 1997, Applicant was employed as a\nprincipal engineer/consultant for a computer company. During the first four years of his\nemployment, he attended college part-time. In June 1984, he was awarded his bachelor\nof science degree in electrical and electronics engineering (Exs. 2, K). \nIn 1997, Applicant and two partners started their own business serving as a\n\u201cmaster distributor\u201d for a data storage manufacturer (Tr. 72). In mid-March 1997, their\ncompany executed a secured promissory note with the bank in SOR 1.b in the principal\nloan amount of $100,000 (Ex. 5). The bank was given a security interest in all of the\ncompany\u2019s business inventory, chattel paper, accounts, equipment and general\nintangibles (Ex. 5). Applicant, as company vice president, and one of his business\n\n3\npartners, the company\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO), executed commercial guarantees\n(signed the line of credit), guaranteeing all indebtedness of the company to the bank\n(Ex. 5, Tr. 73, 102). A second line of credit, also in the amount of $100,000, was\nobtained from another bank (SOR 1.a), with Applicant and the CEO guaranteeing that\nloan (Ex. 1, Tr. 102-03). Applicant did not handle the finances of the business, but he\nbelieves the lines of credit were being paid while the business was in operation (Tr. 103-\n04). Applicant invested some of his personal funds in the business, from which he\nreceived \u201ca small amount\u201d of income (Tr. 102). Applicant also borrowed $27,000 from\nhis brother (\u201ca personal loan\u201d) that he invested in the business (Tr. 135, 137).\nAfter the data storage equipment manufacturer began direct sales, Applicant\u2019s\nand his partners\u2019 distribution business failed (Tr. 73). The company offered its inventory\nas collateral to the banks when it could no longer make its loan payments (Tr. 104).\nApplicant estimated the value of the inventory to be about $800,000 (Tr. 73), but he\nprovided no evidence showing an accurate valuation of the company\u2019s assets.\nIn 2000, both banks filed lawsuits against the company and the loan guarantors\n(Applicant and the CEO) for default on the respective promissory notes. In June 2000,\nApplicant, the CEO, and the company stipulated to a judgment awarding the bank in\nSOR 1.b $116,418.27, inclusive of interests and costs. Applicant and the CEO were\nheld jointly and severally liable for the judgment. Any amounts received by the bank\nfrom the sale of the collateral, the attachments of the defendants\u2019 bank accounts or real\nestate or other source were to be credited against the judgment (Ex. 5, Tr. 74). In June\n2001, a successor in interest to the lender in SOR 1.a obtained a judgment against\nApplicant of $112,130.20 plus costs, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and interest from April\n2000 (Tr. 72).\nApplicant had sold his residence in June 1998 (Ex. 6), giving him about $32,000\nafter his mortgage was satisfied (Tr. 75-76, 96, 132). The proceeds went to partially\nsatisfy the $116,418.27 judgment debt (SOR 1.b). Applicant\u2019s brother, who felt he was\nentitled to the funds because he had loaned Applicant $27,000, filed a lawsuit against\nthe bank for the money in 2001. Applicant was subpoenaed to testify on behalf of the\ncreditor bank (Tr. 106). On June 13, 2001, Applicant provided false testimony under\noath concerning communications he had in 2000 with the attorney who represented\nhim, his former business partner, and the company, in the judgment action brought by\nthe bank. Applicant was indicted on three counts of perjury in October 2001. In March\n2004, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of an amended charge of false\nswearing, a class A misdemeanor (SOR 2.a). Applicant signed a form acknowledging\nthat he understood he was admitting to, or not contesting, the truth of the charges\nagainst him and that a conviction would be entered against him. A finding of guilty was\nentered for both counts. He was sentenced on one count to a 12-month jail term,\nsuspended on good behavior and compliance with all terms and conditions, and a\n$1,000 fine plus statutory penalty assessment to be paid on or before March 26, 2004.\nApplicant was sentenced on the second count to a consecutive 12-month jail term,\nsuspended, and a fine of $2,000 plus statutory assessment, suspended for two years.\nThe remaining perjury charge, which related to whether he knew his attorney had\nentered his appearance in January 2000, was nolle prossed (Ex. 4). Applicant was not\n\nW hen asked on cross-examination to confirm whether he had testified falsely in June 2001\n1\nconcerning his communications with the company\u2019s attorney in January 2000, Applicant responded that he\ndidn\u2019t believe his statement was false at the time, although he went on that he was not sure \u201csince it\u2019s a long\ntime ago.\u201d (Tr. 106). He then claimed that he had relied on his memory at the time and had since learned that\nit is better \u201cto go with what you write, that\u2019s why these days I write things down.\u201d (Tr. 109). W hen subsequently\nasked about whether or not he believed he had committed a crime, Applicant responded:\nNobody personally feels guilty about, at times but things in life, it\u2019s, at this time it\u2019s not clear\nto me, it\u2019s something that I haven\u2019t dwelled on, thinking about it day in and day out. It\u2019s a\nportion of my life, it was one instance in my life that I was involved with anything like this or\nin a court, with any law or anything, and I just, it is, maybe it\u2019s I just mentally want to forget\nabout it and just move on. I personally have moved on and I, at times, it\u2019s like thinking of it\nI\u2019m guilty, not guilty, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to help my case. W hat I can do is to set an\nexample from that day on and I think I have. I\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t have a black and white\nanswer for you but that\u2019s how it is (Tr. 117).\n4\nwilling to acknowledge at his July 2009 hearing that he had knowingly provided false\ntestimony in his brother\u2019s case against the bank.1\nDuring 2002 and 2003, Applicant worked as an enterprise architect and then\ndirector of storage architecture for a commercial company. He has been consistently\nemployed as a contractor, providing his expertise in data network storage for the U.S.\nmilitary at his work location since October 2004 (Exs. 1, H). \nOn June 7, 2004, Applicant executed his first application for a security clearance.\nHe disclosed that he pleaded no contest on the advice of his attorney and paid a fine of\n$2,200 on three counts of an unspecified misdemeanor offense. In response to question\n37 concerning unpaid judgments, Applicant listed two $100,000 judgments awarded in\n2000 for business loans that he had cosigned. He indicated he was unaware of the\nexact date or of the final amount of the judgments (Ex. 2). Applicant provided the same\ndebt information on an e-QIP completed on December 1, 2005, but he clarified that he\npleaded nolo contendere to two counts of misdemeanor false swearing. He reiterated\nthat he entered nolo pleas on the advice of counsel (Ex. 1). As of December 20, 2005,\nthe credit bureaus were reporting that the original lender in SOR 1.a had filed in court to\nattach Applicant\u2019s assets to recover a $120,000 debt balance (Ex. 6).\nIn 2006 or 2007, after he applied for a security clearance, Applicant retained\nlegal counsel to represent him in settling the judgment debts in SOR 1.a and 1.b (Tr.\n81). As of late May 2008, his attorney was in negotiations with the creditor in SOR 1.a,\nbut there had been no action on resolving the debt in SOR 1.b (Ex. 3). As of June 2009,\nhis attorney had no success in reaching a person with the authority to negotiate on\nbehalf of the bank (Ex. I, Tr. 91). In the event negotiations were unsuccessful, the\nattorney was prepared to represent Applicant in a bankruptcy proceeding (Ex. 3). As of\nJuly 2009, Applicant had offered to settle the judgment debt in SOR 1.a for an amount\nin the low $20,000s. While his attorney reported on June 12, 2009, that the creditor was\nevaluating settlement proposals (Ex. M), Applicant testified on July 1, 2009, that his\noffer was rejected by the creditor (Tr. 87). He had not filed for bankruptcy. Apart from\nthe equity in his house that went to satisfy, in part, the debt in SOR 1.b, Applicant had\npaid nothing toward the judgment debts as of July 2009 (Tr. 91, 95). He believes that\n\n5\nthe bank in SOR 1.b received the proceeds from an auction of the inventory of the failed\nbusiness (Ex. 3). There is no available information confirming his belief. He understands\nthat his former business partner, who had also guaranteed the loans, had filed for\nbankruptcy \u201ca few years back.\u201d (Tr. 130).\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a May 2008 credit\nreport showing he had no delinquent credit card debt. Applicant was making payments\nas agreed on three open credit card accounts with balances of $17,818, $1,585, and\n$1,064 (Ex. 3). As of June 4, 2009, he had brought down the balance of the $17,818\ndebt to $14,289, and had paid off the $1,585 owed on another account. But his balance,\nalthough current, had increased from $1,064 to $2,655 on the third credit card account,\nand he had incurred $12,106 in charges on a credit card account that had a reported\nzero balance as of May 2008. Applicant was making his monthly mortgage payments on\ntime, $1,998 on a primary mortgage of $231,771, and $341 on a second mortgage of\n$43,793 (Ex. L). As of June 10, 2008, Applicant reported a net monthly remainder of\n$4,341 on net monthly income of $11,835 (Ex. 3). As of July 2009, he estimated his\nannual income at about $180,000 (Tr. 71, 79). He had about $20,000 to $30,000 in cash\nassets available to pay the judgments (Tr. 124). Applicant participated in an internet and\ntelephone credit counseling session on June 22, 2009 (Ex. J).\nApplicant underwent a voluntary psychological evaluation on April 20, 2009, by a \nclinical psychologist to determine whether he exhibited clinical indicators of lying\nbehavior. Applicant informed the psychologist that the perjury stemmed from a business\nfailure, and explained that while testifying as a witness for the bank, he responded \u201cno\u201d\nto whether he had personally discussed the writ of summons with his attorney before\nmid-March 2000. The psychologist opined that Applicant was not deceptive:\nHis mental status examination was generally unremarkable other then his\nmild to moderate anxiety throughout the process. He was not, however,\nseen as deceptive but generally presented a picture of involvement in a\nlegal system in which he was uncomfortable and received questionable\nadvice. The fact that English is not his first language may well have\ncontributed to his confusion with our legal system. His naivety [sic] within\nthis arena was seen as the major reason for his consent to being\nconvicted of two perjury charges.\nThe psychologist found no significant indication of lying behavior and he did not regard\nApplicant to be a threat to national security (Ex. K).\nTwo of Applicant\u2019s three current business partners testified for Applicant at the\nhearing. They endorsed Applicant for a security clearance based on Applicant\u2019s\ndemonstrated subject matter knowledge and dedication to the contract (Exs. A, B).\nNeither of the partners is fully aware of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nprevious business failure. The active partner in their consulting company, who has\nworked closely with Applicant since 2004 (Ex. B, Tr. 36), understands from Applicant\nthat he has made reparations (Tr. 37), and that the judgment debts have been paid (Tr.\n41). An inactive partner, who derives his income from the subcontractor rather than from\n\n6\ntheir consulting company (Tr. 51), became aware the day of the hearing that Applicant\nhas not yet resolved the issue of an unpaid business loan of about $120,000 (Tr. 53).\nHe has found Applicant to be \u201cvery honest, straightforward,\u201d and of \u201csterling character.\u201d\n(Ex. A, Tr. 54-55). Applicant is considered a key member of their team and is held in\nhigh regard by their military customer as well as their professional colleagues (Exs. A-E,\nN, Tr. 49-50). The subcontractor on the project recognized Applicant\u2019s invaluable\ncontributions with an award given to those individuals who demonstrate superior\nunderstanding and integrity in their field and apply it to the customer (Exs. A, B).\nA close personal friend and work colleague who has known Applicant for the last\nseven years also testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf (Ex. O, Tr. 59). He does not doubt\nApplicant\u2019s commitment to the job or his honesty (Tr. 62). He became aware of the\noutstanding financial obligations and the misdemeanor false testimony charge (Tr. 60)\nthe night before the hearing (Tr. 63, 67). The friend believes that the bank has a lien on\nApplicant\u2019s assets because of an unpaid business loan debt of about $120,000, and that\nApplicant \u201cpleaded out\u201d to a charge of false statement (Tr. 64, 68).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion in obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\nAvailable court records show that Applicant and the CEO were liable on the judgment awarded the\n2\nbank in SOR 1.b. Applicant testified that he and the CEO were jointly and severally liable as well on the debt\nin SOR 1.a, although the court document lists only Applicant as the defendant (Ex. 5).\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe evidence shows that two financial institutions obtained sizable judgments of\n$112,130 and $116,418 against Applicant and a business partner in 2000/01 after the\ncompany that they founded could no longer make its payments on two lines of credit\nthat they had guaranteed.  Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\n2\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d apply.\nOf the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 20, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies to the extent that the debts stem from a\nbusiness failure more than nine years ago, and do not appear to be characteristic of\nApplicant\u2019s handling of his finances generally. He has a track record of timely payments\non his personal financial obligations, including his mortgages and credit cards. While\nApplicant is a business partner with three others (one active) in the consulting company\nfrom which he derives his current income of about $180,000 per year, there is no\n\n8\nevidence that he owes any debts from his consulting business. The circumstances that\nled to these judgment debts are not likely to recur.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d must be considered because the debts\nstem from a business failure. It is unclear to what extent Applicant was involved in the\ndaily operations of the distribution company. He apparently did not handle the financial\nmatters, and was not in control of the data storage equipment manufacturer\u2019s decision\nto bypass the distribution network and sell directly to potential customers. However, I\nam unable to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(b) because of Applicant\u2019s demonstrated irresponsibility\nin not making resolution of these judgment debts a priority. Applicant testified that the\nbank in SOR 1.b received $32,000 from the sale of his home in partial satisfaction, and\nhad acquired and auctioned the business inventory. Applicant believed the value of the\ninventory amply covered the judgments. The lawsuit brought by his brother (a personal\ncreditor) against the bank over the $32,000 tends to substantiate that the equity in\nApplicant\u2019s previous residence was turned over to the bank in SOR 1.b. Applicant\u2019s\nDecember 2005 credit report (Ex. 6) shows a mortgage loan was closed and paid in\nJune 1998, which would have predated the judgment award. The home that was sold\n(Ex. 3) was listed as his residence of record from May 1982 until June 1998 (Ex. 2). The\nbank may well have received the funds sometime after the award of the judgment in\n2000 and his brother\u2019s lawsuit in June 2001. However, there is no proof that the\ninventory of the business was auctioned off by the creditor, or if an auction was\nconducted, whether the proceeds satisfied the judgment. Assuming that the creditor in\nSOR 1.b has been compensated in part, Applicant has not made any payments on the\njudgment debt since 2001. Moreover, Applicant made no effort to address the debt in\nSOR 1.a before he retained legal counsel in 2006 or 2007, after he applied for his\nsecurity clearance (Tr. 81). Two to three years later, Applicant is still trying to settle that\njudgment debt, apparently for less than a quarter of the balance.\nAG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is implicated because of the payment of $32,000, but I am\nunable to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(d) because of his disregard of the judgment debts after\n2001 until they became an issue for his security clearance. AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d does not apply. The creditor in\nSOR 1.a rejected Applicant\u2019s latest settlement offer. Applicant\u2019s attorney indicated that\nhe had made \u201cseveral attempts\u201d without success to contact someone who handles\ncommercial transactions for the bank in SOR 1.b, so that debt is also not likely to be\nresolved in the near future. Furthermore, one session of internet and telephone debt\ncounseling does not alleviate the financial burden of about $200,000 in unpaid judgment\ndebt. While Applicant indicated that he has the means to satisfy the judgments, the\navailable information suggests otherwise. He testified he has $20,000 or $30,000 in\ncombined cash assets (Tr. 123-24) and his latest credit report shows he has\noutstanding credit card balances totaling about $29,050 (Ex. L). Although he is making\nmonthly payments on his credit card obligations, this is a significant amount of credit\n\nUnder the pertinent state\u2019s criminal code (Title 62), Chapter 641 concerning false swearing in official\n3\nmatters provides as follows:\nA person is guilty of a misdemeanor if:\nI. He makes a false statement under oath or affirmation or swears or affirms the truth of such\na statement previously made and he does not believe the statement to be true if:\n(a) The falsification occurs in an official proceeding, as defined in RSA 641:1, II, or is made\n9\ncard debt, the repayment of which has been given priority over the outstanding\njudgments of about $200,000.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in Guideline J, \u00b6 30 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nIn October 2001, Applicant was indicted on three counts of felony perjury\nstemming from testimony he gave under oath in a June 2001 civil lawsuit brought by his\nbrother against the bank in SOR 1.b. The case was disposed of through a nolo\ncontendere plea in March 2004 to two counts of misdemeanor false swearing, and guilty\nfindings were entered against him. His misdemeanor convictions raise criminal conduct\nconcerns implicating AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d\nand AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \nThe passage of eight years since the offenses is a significant mitigating condition\n(see AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). Also in his\nfavor are his disclosures of the criminal conduct on two security clearance applications\n(Exs. 1, 2). His character references, some in person and others in writing, amply\nconfirm his invaluable dedication to the military project that has consumed his\nconsiderable time and talent since late 2004. The passage of time without recurrence of\nthe criminal activity and his good employment record are evidence of successful\nrehabilitation under AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement\u201d). Concerning restitution, there is no evidence that Applicant\nfailed to comply with his sentences, including payment of a $1,000 fine.\nYet this evidence in reform must be weighed against the seriousness of the\noffense. Although false swearing is punishable as a misdemeanor and not a felony\nunder the pertinent state\u2019s criminal statutes,  a knowing false statement made under\n3\n\nwith a purpose to mislead a public servant in performing his official function; or\n(b) The statement is one which is required to be sworn or affirmed before a notary or other\nperson authorized to administer oaths: or\nII. He makes inconsistent statements under oath or affirmation, both within the period of\nlimitations, one of which is false and not believed by him to be true. In a prosecution under\nthis section, it need not be alleged or proved which of the statements is false but only that\none or the other was false and not believed by the defendant to be true.\nIII. No person shall be guilty under this section if he retracts the falsification before it becomes\nmanifest that the falsification was or would be exposed.\n10\noath raises very serious concerns about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. Applicant does not dispute his convictions, but he testified equivocally\nat his July 2009 hearing about whether he had knowingly provided false testimony in\nJune 2001. He initially testified that he did not believe he made a false statement at the\ntime, and claimed that he had relied on his memory. Yet, when asked later whether he\nbelieved he had committed a crime, Applicant responded that he had moved on and did\nnot have \u201ca black and white answer.\u201d\nApplicant persuaded the psychologist who evaluated him in April 2009 that\nnaivete led him to plead nolo contendere (\u201c[Applicant] was not, however, seen as\ndeceptive, but generally presented a picture of involvement in a legal system in which\nhe was uncomfortable and received questionable advice.\u201d Ex. K). But I am not\nconvinced that either Applicant\u2019s lack of familiarity with the legal system or him being a\nnonnative English speaker, or both, caused the false testimony at issue. The available\ncourt records (Ex. 4) indicate that the questions asked of Applicant when he testified in\nJune 2001 were straightforward and about matters that would have been within his\nknowledge. Although he is a naturalized U.S. citizen, he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in\nthe U.S. and had resided here for some 20 years before he testified in 2001. As a\nsubject matter expert in data storage, Applicant can be expected to have understood\nthe legal implications of pleading nolo contendere, and also of the importance of full\ncandor during the security clearance process.\nConcerns persist about his reform, given his inability to provide a consistent,\ncredible account of his conduct on June 2001, and evidence showing that Applicant has\nnot been completely forthright with his active business partner about whether the\njudgments had been paid. When queried about his knowledge of the government\u2019s\nallegations, the witness responded that, from what Applicant had told him, \u201creparations\nhad been made.\u201d Asked directly whether he believed that the debts had been repaid,\nthe witness responded, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d (Tr. 41). \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\n\n11\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nThe financial issues stem from Applicant guaranteeing two lines of credit for a\nbusiness venture that failed by 2000. Applicant believes, but has not verified, that the\nCEO who cosigned the two promissory notes filed for bankruptcy. It is in his favor that\nhe has retained legal counsel to negotiate with his two creditors. But as of July 2009,\nthe judgments have not been satisfied. He is willing and able to pay less than a quarter\nof the balance owed on the judgment in SOR 1.a. It would be premature to conclude\nthat the financial concerns, which include a risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds, are fully mitigated at this juncture.\nFurthermore, Applicant caused considerable doubt about his judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness by lying under oath in a civil case in June 2001, and by being\nunwilling to acknowledge and express remorse for his criminal behavior. While the\npersons who have worked closely with him attest to his honesty and reliability, the\ncolleagues who testified at his July 2009 hearing had limited knowledge of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns. Applicant\u2019s partner in their consulting business had\nbeen led to believe from Applicant that he had made full reparations of the judgment\ndebt in SOR 1.a. Applicant has yet to make a single payment to that creditor. Despite\nthe passage of time since his false swearing misconduct, I cannot conclude at this time\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline H for drug involvement, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana approximately eight to ten times during the period January 1988 to July 2007. Under Guideline E for personal conduct, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana in July 2007 after completing and submitting a security-clearance application in April 2007, in which he was placed on notice that illegal drug use was a security concern. In his eight-page Answer, Applicant admitted the marijuana use as alleged under Guideline H and he admitted using marijuana in July 2007 as alleged under Guideline E. In addition, Applicant provided additional facts and information intended to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the SOR allegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a software-development company that has contracts with the federal government, including the Defense Department. He has worked for his current employer as a general manager (director of product development) since January 2007. He has worked in the software industry for several 3 companies in various capacities since earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in 1992.

Rotkis, Esquire\n \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on March 31, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline H based on Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use (marijuana) and\nGuideline E for personal conduct. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided\nfor Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR is dated May 8, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing (Tr. 9). The case was assigned to another administrative judge who scheduled\na hearing for June 26, 2008. It did not take place as scheduled due to a medical\nemergency of the judge. The case was reassigned to me on July 21, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on August 13, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nAugust 21, 2008.\nThe record was left open until August 27, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit additional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission and\nthe post-hearing exhibits are admitted as follows: 1) Exhibit E\u2013court reporter\u2019s\nverification of Applicant\u2019s divorce in 2004; 2) Exhibit F\u2013stipulation on conservatorship,\npossession, support, and other issues in Applicant\u2019s divorce; and 3) Exhibit G\u2013letter\nfrom a clinical and forensic psychologist in connection with Applicant\u2019s divorce.\nCounsel\u2019s cover letter for the exhibits is not admitted as evidence, but it is filed in the\ncorrespondence folder of the case file. The same applies to department counsel\u2019s e-\nmail expressing no objections to the post-hearing exhibits.  \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement, the SOR alleges that Applicant used\nmarijuana approximately eight to ten times during the period January 1988 to July 2007.\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana\nin July 2007 after completing and submitting a security-clearance application in April\n2007, in which he was placed on notice that illegal drug use was a security concern. In\nhis eight-page Answer, Applicant admitted the marijuana use as alleged under\nGuideline H and he admitted using marijuana in July 2007 as alleged under Guideline E.\nIn addition, Applicant provided additional facts and information intended to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the SOR allegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole,\nthe following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a software-development company that\nhas contracts with the federal government, including the Defense Department.  He has\nworked for his current employer as a general manager (director of product\ndevelopment) since January 2007. He has worked in the software industry for several\n\n3\ncompanies in various capacities since earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science\nin 1992. He is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. \nApplicant married in 1993 and divorced in 2004 (Exhibits 1, E, F, and G). He and\nthis wife had one child, a daughter, born in 1999. Applicant\u2019s wife suffered from\npostpartum depression, which later led to other serious mental-health issues (Tr.\n31\u201334). His wife\u2019s condition deteriorated to the point in May 2003 when Applicant\nsought and obtained a temporary protective order against his wife based on a clear and\npresent danger of family violence (Exhibit F). Applicant now has custody of his\ndaughter. \nAbout four months after he started his current job, Applicant completed a\nsecurity-clearance application in April 2007 (Exhibit 1). In response to Question 24a,  he\ndisclosed that he had illegally used a controlled substance within the last seven years.\nHe reported using marijuana eight to ten times during the period January 1997 to April\n2007.\nIn about March 2008, Applicant responded to written interrogatories issued to\nhim by DOHA (Exhibit 2). He reported using marijuana very rarely, no more than one to\ntwo breaths per setting. He reported that he last used marijuana in July 2007, and that\nhe had no intention to use it in the future. He explained that he had decided after the\nJuly 2007 usage to never again participate in using marijuana, and that he would\nremove himself from any situation where marijuana was present. \nHe confirmed and provided additional information about his marijuana use in his\nhearing testimony. Among other things, he stated the following about his marijuana\ninvolvement:\n\u2022\nThat he has never purchased marijuana and has no plans to do so (Tr. 25).\n\u2022\nThat his marijuana use goes back to about 1988 when he used it a few times\nwith college friends (Tr. 39\u201340).\n\u2022\nThat his marijuana use during 2006\u20132007 took place on dates when the women\noffered marijuana (Tr. 42\u201343).\n\u2022\nThat he decided to never use marijuana again after the July 2007 use because\nhe \u201cwas appalled\u201d by the circumstances (Tr. 51\u201352).\n\u2022\nApplicant described his marijuana use in July 2007 as \u201cridiculous,\u201d and he now\nrealizes how naive he was as he did not appreciate the potential ramifications on\na security clearance (Tr. 53). \n\u2022\nUsing marijuana was not part of his marriage and it is not part of his current\nrelationship (Tr. 61\u201362). \n\u2022\nHis reported marijuana use is an estimate and he has \u201cpadded\u201d the number to err\non over reporting (Tr. 62\u201363). \n\u2022\nHe estimates using marijuana eight to ten times during the period January 1997\nto present, and he estimates using marijuana a total of about 12 times, which\nincludes his use in college (Tr. 62\u201364).  \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n4\nApplicant states that marijuana use occupies no place in his life and he has no\nintention of using marijuana again. He executed an affidavit to that effect in which he\npledged that he will never again use marijuana, and he understands that any security\nclearance will be automatically revoked for any illegal use of a controlled substance\n(Exhibit B). \nProfessionally, Applicant is a well-regarded employee whom his direct supervisor\ndescribes as a consummate executive, an employee that the supervisor recruited to\nwork for the company (Exhibit A). Other individuals, witnesses and by letters of\nreference, attest to Applicant\u2019s professional and personal qualities and believe Applicant\nis a trustworthy individual (Exhibits C and D). The witnesses included Applicant\u2019s\ngirlfriend who is a program manager for a federal contractor and she holds a security\nclearance as well. She was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d when she learned about\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use, and she will end their relationship if he uses marijuana again\n(Tr. 93\u201395). She assessed Applicant\u2019s priorities as his daughter and family first and his\ncareer and work second (Tr. 95). And she described Applicant as an individual who\nfollows the rules, giving as an example Applicant\u2019s habit of adhering to speed limits,\nwhich she finds frustrating from time to time (Tr. 63\u201364). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n5\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. An adverse decision is not a determination of an\napplicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the\n13\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security\nclearance.\nAnalysis\n1.\nThe Drug Involvement Security Concern\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n14\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\n\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n16\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n17\n Revised Guidelines at 18.\n18\n6\nregulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\n15\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d16\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following conditions raise a\nsecurity concern:\n\u2022\nAny drug abuse (see above definition); and \n\u2022\nIllegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.17\nApplicant\u2019s history of drug abuse (and incidental possession of marijuana) raises\nsecurity concerns because it calls into question his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness,\nand willingness to obey the law. His use of marijuana in social settings goes back to his\ncollege days and extends to July 2007. Altogether, the evidence shows he used\nmarijuana about a dozen times during this period of nearly two decades. Of most\nconcern is his marijuana use during 2006\u20132007 when he was beyond the age of 35, a\ntime in life when most people have left such activity in the past. His marijuana use\nduring 2006-2007 took place in social settings (while dating), and he did not buy,\nprovide, or seek out the marijuana as it was offered to him. Nevertheless, these\ncircumstances show that Applicant used poor judgment on these occasions. \nThe four mitigating conditions under Guideline H have been considered and the\nmost pertinent here is MC 2.  It provides that security concerns may be mitigated if an\n18\napplicant is able to show a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future by\nactions such as: 1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 2) changing\nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; 3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; or 4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation. MC 2 applies in Applicant\u2019s favor for four reasons. First, he is no longer\nassociating with the marijuana users from the 2006-2007 period as he is no longer\ncasually dating and instead is involved in a serious, exclusive relationship. Second, he\nhas pledged to avoid marijuana by removing himself from the area and people if\nmarijuana is present. Third, his last use of marijuana took place in July 2007, more than\none year ago. That is an appropriate period of abstinence given his relatively infrequent\nuse of marijuana (a dozen times during nearly two decades). And fourth, Applicant has\npledged, in an affidavit, not to use any controlled substance in the future and has\nagreed to automatic revocation of any clearance for any violation. Given all these\ncircumstances, I am persuaded that Applicant has no intention to engage in drug abuse\nin the future. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n19\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n20\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201311. \n21\n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or\n22\ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\n7\n2.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n19\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n20\nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, the issue here is the security significance of Applicant\u2019s\nJuly 2007 marijuana use, which took place after he completed a security-clearance\napplication about four months earlier. Although this incident was considered under\nGuideline H, it has independent security significance under Guideline E. Indeed,\nApplicant used particularly poor judgment when he used marijuana after completing a\nsecurity-clearance application. It was inappropriate behavior and he plainly should have\nknown better. Accordingly, the most pertinent disqualifying condition is DC 4,  which\n21\ncovers a broad spectrum of credible adverse information that indicates questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, etc.\nThe security concerns under Guideline E are mitigated under a similar rationale\nused to mitigate Guideline H, as Applicant has demonstrated an intent not to engage in\ndrug abuse in the future. In addition, MC 4  applies in his favor. Applicant, through his\n22\nself-reporting, has acknowledged the behavior and taken positive steps, as discussed\nunder Guideline H, to alleviate the circumstances that caused poor judgment. And given\nthe infrequency of his marijuana use, the passage of time since July 2007 without\nrecurrence, the strong incentives Applicant has to refrain from marijuana use (in\nparticular, his personal life would be in some jeopardy), it is quite unlikely that\nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse will recur.  \n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n23\n8\n3.\nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the Directive, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant facts and circumstances. This analysis includes nine\nadjudicative factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n23\nI considered these nine factors, as well as Applicant\u2019s good employment record\nand favorable character evidence. First, Applicant impressed me as a serious, focused,\nand hard-working individual who is doing his best to do right by his daughter, his\ngirlfriend, and his employer. Second, I also considered the circumstance that he\nvoluntarily reported his marijuana use when he completed his security-clearance\napplication in 2007 and in response to written interrogatories in 2008. A core value or\nprinciple of the industrial security clearance program is that the government must have\nconfidence that those individuals with access to classified information can be relied on\nto exercise good judgment, which includes the willingness to report adverse information,\nsecurity violations, etc. Applicant\u2019s willingness to self-report his marijuana use shows\nthat he can be relied on to exercise good judgment. On balance, my analysis under the\nwhole-person concept weighs in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant presented sufficient\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant met\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is\ndecided for  Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:\n \nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.   \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Marine, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 20, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 2, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 13, 2008. Applicant filed a response\nto the FORM on July 10, 2008. The case was assigned to me on July 31, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26 year old employee of a defense contractor. She was married in\n2000 and divorced in 2003.\nApplicant is indebted to CANON DE ARROWHEAD in the approximate amount of\n$2,666.00 as a result of a judgment entered against her. She has contacted the creditor,\nbut to date has not taken any action to pay the judgment.\nApplicant is indebted to PARAGONWAY/CHECKMATE in the approximate\namount of $368.00. In her response to the SOR, applicant stated this debt was\ntransferred to Phoenix Debt Management (PDM) and that she paid it. Although she\nattached a copy of her check register showing three payments totaling $293.00 were\nmade to PDM, she provided no evidence that links PDM with the original creditor.\nApplicant is alleged to be indebted in the approximate amount of $146.00 \u201con a\nmedical account\u201d that has been turned over to a collection agency. In her response to\nthe SOR, applicant stated this debt was owed to Radiology Associates (RA) and has\nbeen paid. In her response to the FORM, she attached a check register showing a\n$28.82 payment was made to RA in March 2008. However, she has not provided any\nproof that this payment satisfied the debt.\nApplicant is indebted to COLLECTRIT/OSCAR QUINTANA in the approximate\namount of $54.00. This debt was placed for collection. Applicant claims she satisfied\nthis debt, but offered no proof.\nApplicant \nwas \nindebted \nto \nHUNTER \nWARFIELD/SEDONA \nRIDGE\nAPARTMENTS for two debts that had been placed for collection. The first debt, in the\namount of $252.00, was satisfied by applicant in March 2008. The second debt stood at\n$531.00. In her response to the SOR, applicant stated \u201cpayments are currently being\nmade on this account and I have one payment left which will occur on 6/6/08.\" She\nattached to her SOR response proof that she has made three payments, totaling\n$340.52, to the creditor. Although in her response to the FORM she stated \u201cthis account\nhas been paid in full,\u201d she provided no proof she made the last payment.\nApplicant is indebted to WFNNB/AHF in the approximate amount of $439.00.\nThis debt was charged off. Applicant was in contact with this creditor in March 2008,\nand it appears she made at least two payments since then. The total amount of the two\npayments is unclear as her checking account indicates $235.00 was paid while\ncorrespondence from the creditor indicates applicant authorized $300.00 in payments to\nbe made from her checking account. Either way she still has a balance due. In her\nresponse to the FORM applicant stated the account \u201chas been paid in full,\u201d but she\noffered no proof of this fact.\nApplicant is indebted to PALISADES/ATT in the approximate amount of $580.00.\nThis debt has been placed for collection.\nApplicant was indebted to PURPLN/FBD in the approximate amount of $683.00.\nThis debt was charged off. In her response to the SOR, applicant stated \u201cthis debt has\n\n3\nbeen paid in full to Nations Recovery.\u201d A check register she attached to her SOR\nresponse indicates she made five payments totaling $580.00 between February and\nApril 2008 to Nations Recovery. However, she presented no evidence indicating that the\ncreditor has accepted these payments as payment in full.\nApplicant is indebted to CPS/MAIL in the approximate amount of $10,076.00 as a\nresult of the voluntary repossession of her vehicle in 2004. Applicant has been in\ncontact with the creditor, but to date has not made any payments on the debt.\nApplicant has three medical debts totaling approximately $3,116.00 dating back\nto at least 2006. In her response to the FORM, she stated these debts should have\nbeen covered by Medicare, and she has \u201cbeen working on the dispute process.\u201d\nIn her response to the SOR, applicant stated: \u201cI am currently trying to pay my\npast debts which I now understand how important it is to pay my financial obligations.\nThis debt came about by my past divorce and unable to stay current with all my debts.\u201d\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\n\n4\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay her debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant has numerous\ndelinquent debts that are still outstanding. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is not\napplicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nfailed to provide specific details to support a finding that her present financial\ndelinquencies were caused by her 2003 divorce. This mitigating condition is not\napplicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20. c. Applicant went to see a counselor, but\nnever received counseling. Her financial problems are not under control. This mitigation\ncondition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant\n\n5\nappears to have made a good-faith effort to begin to repay a number of her creditors.\nThis mitigating condition applies.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nhas a long history of being unable to meet her financial obligations. Although she has\naddressed some of the delinquent debts, the evidence does not support a finding that\nshe is likely to be in a position to address the bulk of her past-due indebtedness anytime\nsoon, or that she is unlikely to experience additional financial delinquencies. Based on\nthe foregoing, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct), H (Drug Involvement), and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 22, 2007. \nOn June 28, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines J, H, and E. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nDecember 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on July 6, 2010; answered it partially on July 13, \n2010; completed his answer on July 26, 2010; and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on July 26, 2010. Department \nCounsel was ready to proceed on August 25, 2010, and the case was assigned to me \non August 27, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 2, 2010, \nscheduling it for September 22, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified but presented no witnesses or documentary evidence. I kept the \nrecord open until October 8, 2010, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He \ntimely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through DD, which were admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX A through DD are attached to \nthe record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 4, \n2010. \n \nBond Amendment \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a post-hearing brief on the applicability of the \nBond Amendment, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c. (HX II.) I agree with Department Counsel\u2019s \nanalysis, and I have concluded that the Bond Amendment does not apply to this case. \nThe reasons for my conclusion are set out in the \u201cAnalysis\u201d section below. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline J allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.r and the Guideline H allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c. He admitted failing to fully \ndisclose his criminal record on his SCA, alleged under Guideline E in SOR \u00b6 3.a, but he \ndenied intentional falsification. At the hearing, he reiterated his denial of SOR \u00b6 3.a. (Tr. \n20-21, 73.) His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old welder employed by a defense contractor since June \n2007. He has worked for federal contractors since January 2000. He was granted an \ninterim security clearance in January 2005. (Tr. 25.) He supervises about 20 employees \nworking on four different U.S. Navy ships. (Tr. 27.) \n \n \nApplicant did not finish high school, but he later received his general educational \ndevelopment (GED) certificate. He completed a three-year apprenticeship in welding in \nabout 1986. (Tr. 24.) \n \n \nIn March 1983 and May 1983, Applicant was charged with petit larceny. He was \n18 years old and living at home. His memory of the offenses was vague, but he believes \nhe and some friends stole some tires. They made restitution and were placed on \nprobation. (GX 4 at 2; Tr. 35-36.) \n \n \nIn June 1985, Applicant was charged with interfering with a police officer. He \ntestified that he and some friends were throwing tomatoes at cars, and they were \n\n \n3 \n \n \nchased by a plain-clothes police officer. He testified that he did not know the person \nchasing and subduing him was a police officer. He was fined but not jailed. (Tr. 38-39.) \n \n \nIn July 1985, Applicant was again arrested and charged with petit larceny. He \ncould not remember the details of this arrest, but he believed he was again fined but not \njailed. (GX 4 at 2; Tr. 38-39.) \n \n \nAlso in July 1985, Applicant was charged with possession of cocaine, a felony. \nHe testified that he possessed a \u201cuser amount\u201d of cocaine. Pursuant to a plea bargain, \nadjudication was deferred and he was sentenced to time served in jail and supervised \nprobation for five years. He successfully completed a 30-day drug rehabilitation \nprogram. There is no evidence that he was diagnosed with drug abuse or drug \ndependence. (GX 1 at 25; Tr. 39-40.) \n \n \nIn June 1987, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to \ndistribute, a felony. He denied intending to sell marijuana, but he admitted that he \npossessed more marijuana than what would be needed for personal use. He testified \nthe charges were dismissed \u201con a technicality.\u201d (Tr. 41-41.) \n \n \nIn June 1989, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony possession of \ncocaine. This arrest was for his possession of cocaine in July 1985, but the charge was \nrevived because he violated his probation. He pleaded guilty in January 1990 and was \nsentence to five years in prison, with four years and six months suspended, and \nsupervised probation for five years. (GX 2 at 13;Tr. 41-42.) \n \n \nIn January 1991, Applicant was charged with shoplifting a package of sausages. \nThe offense was treated as a felony because of his previous offenses. He served about \n30 to 45 days in jail awaiting trial and was sentenced to time served. (GX 4 at 2; Tr. 45-\n46.)  \n \n \nIn June 1992, Applicant was charged with receiving stolen property, and in \nOctober 1992, he was charged with breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony \nand burglary of a dwelling. He testified that the two arrests arose from the same \nincident, in which he and a person who owed him money went into the home of the \ndebtor\u2019s parents, and the debtor stole his parent\u2019s property and gave it to Applicant in \nrepayment of the debt. Applicant was uncertain about the sentence but believed he \nserved about six months in jail. (GX 1 at 25; GX 4 at 2: Tr. 47-48.) \n \n \nOn April 1, 1993, Applicant was arrested for violation of probation. His probation \nwas revoked in July 1993, and he was sentenced to confinement for four years, with all \nconfinement suspended. (GX 2 at 19.) \n \n \nApplicant married in September 1993. He and his wife live lived together for \nabout four years before they married. (Tr. 50.) They have three children, ages 18, 16, \nand 3 (Tr. 23.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn December 1994, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana. (GX 4 \nat 2.) In October 2007, he told a security investigator that the charges were dismissed \nbecause of an illegal search. (GX 3 at 10.) At the hearing, he testified that he could not \nremember this incident. (Tr. 51.)  \n \n \nIn August 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with unauthorized use of an \nautomobile and possession of cocaine. Both offenses were felonies. The charges arose \nwhen Applicant kept a company car at home over a weekend instead of returning it to \nthe shop. He was convicted of the unauthorized use of an automobile and sentenced to \nfive years in prison with two years and two months suspended. (GX 2 at 15; Tr. 52.) His \nprobation was revoked in May 1996, and he was sentenced to two years in prison. (GX \n2 at 17.) He served a total of five years in prison, based on his conviction of \nunauthorized use of an automobile and revocation of his earlier probation. (Tr. 53.)  \n \n \nIn April 1999, Applicant was charged with contempt of court. (GX 4 at 3.) He \nadmitted this charge in his answer to the SOR, but at the hearing he testified he could \nnot remember the circumstances of this arrest. (Tr. 54-55.) \n \n \nIn October 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of a \nfirearm as a convicted felon. In October 2007, he told a security investigator that he was \nstopped by police for failing to signal a turn, and the police found a handgun under the \npassenger seat of his vehicle. He told the investigator he was not convicted of any \ncharges arising from this event. At the hearing, he testified that he and a passenger \nwere stopped by the police at a driver\u2019s license checkpoint, and the police found a pistol \nunder the passenger seat of his truck. He testified that he did not know the pistol was in \nhis vehicle, and he did not know if the pistol belonged to his passenger. Contrary to his \nstatement to the security investigator in October 2007, the court records reflect that he \npleaded guilty and was placed on unsupervised probation for 20 years. (GX 2 at 6-7; \nGX 3 at 11; GX 4 at 3; Tr. 55-57.) \n \n \nIn May 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with sale and distribution of \nmarijuana, a felony, and unlawful possession of a Schedule III controlled substance. In \nOctober 2007, he told a security investigator that he did not know the drugs were in his \ncar and did not know how they were placed in his car. In a subsequent interview in \nNovember 2007, he told the investigator that the drugs were placed in his car by his \ngirlfriend. At the hearing, he testified that the marijuana belonged to a passenger in his \ncar and was in the passenger\u2019s luggage. He denied knowing that his passenger had \nmarijuana in his luggage. He testified that he had a prescription for the Schedule III \nsubstance, a pain killer prescribed for his back pain. The court records reflect that he \nwas convicted of both offenses and was sentenced to 30 days of jail time, suspended. \n(GX 2 at 1-2; GX 3 at 11, 14; Tr. 58.) \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant was cited and fined for a speeding infraction (driving 80 \nmiles per hour (mph) in a 55 mph zone). According to Applicant, he mailed a payment to \nthe court, but his fine was $20 more than the amount he remitted. While he was \noverseas on a project for his employer, his driver\u2019s license was suspended. When he \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreturned from overseas and found that his license had been suspended, he paid the \nremaining $20, and the suspension of his license was lifted. (GX 2 at 8-12; GX Tr. 59-\n60.) At the hearing, he promised to submit documentation that he was overseas when \nhe was convicted and proof that he paid the remaining $20 due on his fine, but he did \nnot include any documentation of these events in his post-hearing submission. (Tr. 83.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in August 2007, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to \nquestion 23a, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of a felony, and \nquestion 23d, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of an offense \nrelated to alcohol or drugs. He disclosed that he had been convicted of receiving stolen \ngoods (a felony) in June 1992 and possession of cocaine in July 1985. He answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to question 23b, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms \nor explosives offense, and \u201cNo\u201d to question 23f, asking if in the last seven years he had \nbeen arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not covered in questions \n23a, b, c, d, or e. He did not disclose the criminal offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m.  \n \n \nDuring an interview by a security investigator in October 2007, Applicant \nadmitted the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.n, after being \nconfronted with the evidence. At a subsequent interview in November 2007, he admitted \nthe criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.q, and 1.r. He did not disclose the conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.p. \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories in July 2009, Applicant expressed some \nuncertainty about whether a five-year period or a seven-year period was covered by \nsome of the questions on the SCA. (GX 3 at 5.) At the hearing, he testified that he had \ndifficulty remembering the dates of various incidents and was confused by some of the \nquestions on the SCA. (Tr. 19-20.) \n \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories in July 2009, Applicant admitted \nrecreational use of marijuana and cocaine an undetermined number of times between \n1982 and 1991. He decided to stop using marijuana and cocaine because it was \ninterfering with his ability to further his education and employment. (GX 3 at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his criminal record to associating with the wrong people and \nnot having regular employment. He no longer lives in his old neighborhood and has no \ncontact with his former friends. Since 2000, he has been regularly employed by federal \ncontractors and has progressed to a supervisory position. He owns his home and \nseveral vehicles. (Tr. 37, 60-61.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current employer has a drug-free workplace policy that allows \nunannounced inspections and drug screening. After the hearing, Applicant submitted a \nstatement agreeing to automatic revocation of his security clearance for any drug \nviolations. (AX A.) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nSince being hired in June 2007, Applicant has completed two fire watch training \nprograms and a shipyard competence course. (AX X, Y, and Z.) In July 2010, Applicant \nreceived a cash award for his outstanding performance. (AX CC.) After the hearing, \nApplicant submitted photographs of 24 command coins given to him as tokens of \nappreciation from the crews of U.S. Navy ships and submarines for whom he had \nprovided professional and technical services. (AX DD.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s first program manager described him as \u201cincredibly dependable,\u201d \ntrustworthy, ambitious, and responsible. (AX B.) His current program manager, who has \nknown him for about 15 months, has observed \u201ca great level of professionalism and \nmaturity, reflecting that Applicant has learned from his mistakes. (AX C.) A vice-\npresident of Applicant\u2019s company believes Applicant has been a reliable employee who \ntakes great pride in his work. (AX D.) The company vice-president submitted 21 letters \nfrom customers attesting to Applicant\u2019s character and performance. These letters from \nsupervisors, project managers, coworkers, and friends uniformly describe Applicant as a \nskillful, effective, compassionate, and caring leader. He has a reputation for high \nintegrity, hard work, and trustworthiness. His technical skills are exceptional. He is a \ngenerous and skillful mentor. He is a loyal friend and a devoted husband and father. \n(AX E through W, AA, and BB.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 18 criminal incidents between March 1983 and April 2008, \nincluding several felonies. The concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record establishes five disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses);  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or \nconvicted);  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d) (currently on parole or probation);  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(e) (violation of parole or probation); and  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(f) (conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial \nof a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long criminal record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). His 20-year \nprobation based on his illegal possession of a firearm in October 2004 establishes AG \u00b6 \n31(d). His parole revocations in July 1993 and May 1996 establish AG \u00b6 31(e). His five-\nyear stint in prison after his arrest in August 1995 and parole revocation in May 1996 \nestablishes AG \u00b6 31(f). \n \nBefore enactment of the Bond Amendment, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, the Smith \nAmendment, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, provided that disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 31(f) made \nan applicant ineligible for a security clearance unless a waiver was granted by the \nSecretary of a military department or an authorized designee. The Bond Amendment \nrepealed the Smith Amendment and limited the statutory disqualification to applicants \nseeking clearances for Special Access Programs, Restricted Data, and Sensitive \nCompartmented Information. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(c)(3). The Bond Amendment does not \napply to Applicant because he is not seeking access to any of the special programs \ncovered by it.  \n \nIt is unclear whether the Bond Amendment eliminated AG \u00b6 31(f) as a \ndisqualifying condition. The interim guidance for implementation of the Bond \nAmendment issued by the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence on June 20, \n2008, did not address the issue. Whether or not AG \u00b6 31(f) remains in effect does not \naffect my decision in this case, because Applicant\u2019s convictions and sentences are \ncovered by the other disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \n \n \nSince the Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c), (e), and (f), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005). In this case, the number and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s crimes and his lengthy \nperiod of incarceration placed a heavy burden of persuasion on him to show that the \nsecurity concerns raised by his criminal conduct have been mitigated.   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The first prong of \nthis mitigating condition focuses on whether the conduct was recent. There are no \nAbright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be \nbased on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time \nhas passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n \nApplicant offered a plausible explanation for his failure to appear in August 2008, \nbut he produced no documentation to support his explanation, even though he stated at \nthe hearing that he would provide it. An infraction is a lesser offense than a \nmisdemeanor and is punishable only by a fine. Department Counsel produced no \nevidence that an infraction is considered a criminal offense under the law of the \njurisdiction where it occurred. \n \n \nWhether or not an infraction is a criminal offense, Applicant\u2019s serious disregard of \nthe speed limit militates against a finding of reform or rehabilitation, because it \ndemonstrates a continuing pattern of disregarding laws and regulations. The \ninconsistencies among Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony and his two statements to a \nsecurity investigator in October and November 2007 raise doubt about his candor and \nindicate that he has not been rehabilitated. On the other hand, Applicant has completed \ntraining to improve his technical skills, been promoted to a supervisory position, and \nestablished a reputation for hard work, dependability, reliability, integrity, and \nleadership. I conclude that the period from April 2008 until the hearing in September \n2010 is a \u201csignificant period of time\u201d but his conflicting statements about the \ncircumstances of his arrests in October 2004 and May 2006 negate the positive \nevidence of rehabilitation. Thus, I conclude that his criminal conduct is not mitigated by \nthe passage of time. The remaining elements of this mitigating condition are not \nestablished because his criminal conduct did not occur under unusual circumstances \nand it casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nTherefore, I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by criminal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). Applicant expressed remorse during interviews by security investigators, in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, and at the hearing. He is regarded as an outstanding \nemployee. However, for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I \nconclude that this mitigating condition is not established. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges that Applicant was arrested, charged, and \nconvicted of drug offenses in 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), arrested for and charged with cocaine \npossession in 1995 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), charged with marijuana possession in December 1994 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g), charged with cocaine possession in 1989 (SOR \u00b6 1.l), charged with \nmarijuana possession in 1987 (SOR \u00b6 1.m), and charged with cocaine possession in \n1985 (SOR \u00b6 1.n). The SOR also alleges that Applicant used marijuana and cocaine an \nundetermined number of times from approximately 1982 to 1991. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: AUse of an illegal drug or \nmisuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1) explains that Guideline H encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his response to DOHA interrogatories and his answer \nto the SOR establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse, defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as \u201cthe illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction\u201d); and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia.) \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant\u2019s last drug involvement was \nin May 2006, more than four years ago. However, for the reasons in the above \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I conclude that this mitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant\u2019s statement (AX A) \ndoes not expressly state that he will not use drugs again, but that intent is implied in his \nstatement agreeing to automatic revocation of his security clearance for any drug \nviolations. I conclude that all four prongs of this mitigating condition are established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by intentionally failing to \ndisclose the full extent of his criminal record. The concern under this guideline is set out \nin AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n11 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this \ncase, the government has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does \nnot prove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n \n \nApplicant attributed his incomplete answers on his SCA to difficulty in \nremembering the dates of his offenses and confusion about some of the questions. His \nresponses to DOHA interrogatories reflect some uncertainty about whether a five-year \nor seven-year period was covered by some of the questions.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing caused me concern about whether he was \ntotally candid about his criminal record. His description of the circumstances of having a \npistol under the seat of his truck in October 2004 was not consistent with his \nexplanation to a security investigator in October 2007. Although he told the investigator \nthat he was not convicted of any offenses arising from this incident, the court records \nshow that he pleaded guilty.  \n \n \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s description of the circumstances of his arrest, charges, \nand conviction of possessing marijuana and a controlled substance in May 2006 varied \nsubstantially from the two inconsistent descriptions of this event he provided to the \nsecurity investigator in October 2007 and November 2007. The SOR does not allege \nthat Applicant gave false answers to the security investigator, but I have considered the \ninconsistency between his answers to the security investigator and his hearing \ntestimony for the limited purposes of assessing his credibility, determining whether he \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation, and deciding whether AG \u00b6 16(a) is \napplicable. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \n \nConcerning his answers on the SCA, I found his explanations implausible and \nnot credible. Questions 23a, 23b, and 23d asked, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of\u201d any felony offense or any firearms, explosives, or drug-related offenses. \nAny confusion about a five-year or seven-year period does not plausibly explain a \nnegative answer to these questions. Question 23f asked if, in the last seven years, \nApplicant had been charged with or convicted of any offenses not covered by the \npreceding questions. His faulty memory about the dates of his offenses does not \nplausibly explain his failure to disclose his drug-related arrest in May 2006, less than a \nyear before he submitted his SCA, or his arrest for a firearms offense in October 2004, \nless than three years before he submitted his SCA. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised \nby Applicant\u2019s responses to questions 23a, 23b, 23d, and 23f. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on an SCA or during a \nsecurity interview may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-\nfaith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). He did not make any effort to complete or correct \nhis responses until he was confronted with the evidence by a security investigator two \nmonths after he submitted his SCA. Even after he was interviewed by the security \ninvestigator, he provided inconsistent information about the omitted offenses and did not \nfully disclose his criminal record. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nFalsification of an SCA is not \u201cminor\u201d because it undermines the integrity of the security \nclearance process. Applicant\u2019s falsification is recent, because it pertains to his current \nSCA. It is arguably \u201cinfrequent,\u201d but it did not happen under unique circumstances \nmaking it unlikely to recur. For these reasons and the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. No other \nenumerated mitigating conditions are applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J, H, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has made significant progress in overcoming his \ncheckered past. He presented himself as sincere and remorseful at the hearing. He is \nobviously embarrassed by his past. The testimonials from his supervisors, friends, and \n\n \n13 \n \n \ncoworkers were impressive. On the other hand, he has persisted in trying to explain \naway his arrests for the firearms offense in October 2004 and the drug offenses in May \n2006, resulting in inconsistent explanations for his conduct and unmitigated concerns \nabout his candor.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, H, \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on his criminal conduct, drug \ninvolvement, and lack of candor on his SCA. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant served in the United States Navy, on active duty for twenty years, between the age of eighteen and thirty-eight. In June 2002, he retired with twenty years of service as an E-6. During his military career he held a DoD security clearance. Upon retirement, his life went into a downward spiral. He was unable to find employment that would make ends meet. To survive, he worked odd jobs for minimum wage and depleted his savings just to keep a roof over his head and food on the table. In 2004, he was unemployed for eight months. From October 2005 to June 2007, he worked as a grocery checker and earned $8.50 an hour. In May 2007, he was hired by his current employer.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 2, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on July 2, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On August 26, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 30, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on November 3, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nNovember 12, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December 11, 2008.  The Government\noffered Five exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant offered two exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A and B, and testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until close\nof business on December 30, 2008 to allow, the Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentation.  None was submitted.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received\n\n2\non December 23, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 44 years old and has a high school diploma and some college.\nHe is employed by a defense contractor as an Assistant Engineer and is seeking to\nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant served in the United States Navy, on active duty for twenty years,\nbetween the age of eighteen and thirty-eight.  In June 2002, he retired with twenty years\nof service as an E-6.  During his military career he held a DoD security clearance.  Upon\nretirement, his life went into a downward spiral.  He was unable to find employment that\nwould make ends meet.  To survive, he worked odd jobs for minimum wage and\ndepleted his savings just to keep a roof over his head and food on the table.  In 2004,\nhe was unemployed for eight months.  From October 2005 to June 2007, he worked as\na grocery checker and earned $8.50 an hour. \nIn May 2007, he was hired by his current employer.  He applied for a security\nclearance but was unable to obtain one within the time frame required by his employer.\nHe then found an opening within the company in a different city that caused him to\nrelocate.  This brought on unexpected expenses including the cost of relocating, car\nproblems and paying back loans to family and friends.  He was unable to resolve these\ndelinquent debts that accumulated over time.  \nThe Applicant is indebted to fourteen separate creditors in the amount of\napproximately $17,500.00.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 4).  Each of the debts\nlisted in the SOR remain delinquent and outstanding.  The Applicant testified that he\nhas not paid any of these debts.  (Tr. p. 35).  He states that he is now in a position to\ntake care of the debts and he intends to pay them all.  (Tr. p. 36).  The Applicant claims\nthat he has disputed one of the debts on line, but offers no documentation to\nsubstantiate this.  He further states that he has no excuse for not taking care of the\ndebts since he has been working for his current employer.  He believes his work and\ncommute schedule, up at 3:00 a.m. and back home by 8:00 p.m. at night has not given\nhim much time to handle these matters.  He does pay child support for his son in the\namount of $550.00 every month.\nThe Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement indicates that after paying his bills\nhe has a net remainder of $1,140.00.  (See Government Exhibit 5). He explained that\nhis net monthly income is $4,550.00.  After spending $350.00 on groceries, $100.00 on\n\n3\nclothing, $500.00 on utilities, $500.00 on car expenses, $100.00 on life insurance, at\nleast $550.00 on child support, $200.00 on medical claims, the rest he spends on his\nson and day to day expenses.  He has $175.00 in his checking account and nothing in\nhis savings.  He recently paid off his car and has at least an additional $400.00 to pay\nhis delinquent debts.  \nHe has received no formal financial counseling.  He is currently studying up on\nhow to clean up his credit and is seeking advice from a coworker who is a financial\nexpert.  (Tr. p. 42).  The Applicant is expecting a promotion and a pay raise in the next\nyear.  He plans to have all of his financial delinquencies resolved by April 15, 2009, or at\nan acceptable level.  (Tr. p. 49). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n19.(e) consistent spending beyond ones means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n\n4\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\n\n5\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant has not made a good faith effort to resolve his past\ndue indebtedness, and there no is evidence of financial rehabilitation. \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nThe Applicant has been gainfully employed since May 2007.  Since then, he has not\npaid even one of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, and remains indebted to each\nof the fourteen creditors listed in the SOR that totals approximately $17,500.00.  He has\nfailed to make a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and thus, he has not\ndemonstrated that he can properly handle his financial affairs.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of his delinquent debts and the impact that it can have on his ability\nto safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has\nfailed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the\nfactual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n\n6\n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns raised under\nGuidelines J, criminal conduct, and D, sexual behavior. Clearance is denied.\nOn July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and D. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 31, 2008, and requested an\nadministrative determination. On December 31, 2008, department counsel prepared a\nFile of Relevant Materials (FORM). Applicant received the FORM on March 4, 2009,\nJuly 13, 2009\n\n2\nand prepared a response on April 9, 2009. The case was assigned to me on April 22,\n2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old man with one adult child. Two previous marriages\nended in divorce. His highest level of education is unknown from the record. He served\nin the Air Force from 1980 to 1988 (Item 4 at 26). Applicant received a general\ndischarge under other than honorable conditions after being court-martialed for\ningesting an illegal substance (Id.). \nSince at least 1999, Applicant has worked as a commercial truck driver. He has\nworked for the same trucking company since 2002 (Item 4 at 11-13).\nOne day on or about December 1, 2000, the phone rang while Applicant was in\nthe shower. He left the shower without clothing himself, and answered the phone in\nanother room. The blinds on his second-story apartment window were open, and he\nwas visible to passers-by (Item 5 at 4-5). Later, after he dressed, a police officer came\nto the door, and told him that a neighborhood child had seen him standing naked in the\nwindow. The officer then arrested and charged him with indecent exposure to a child\n(Item 6 at 2; Item 5 at 5). \nApplicant remained in jail for four to five days after the arrest. His son then\nposted bail, and he was released. Later, Applicant pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of\nindecent exposure, a misdemeanor. The FORM contains conflicting evidence\nconcerning whether Applicant was subsequently sentenced. Although Applicant\nattended counseling after the arrest, it is unclear from the record whether he attended\nvoluntarily or whether he attended as part of a court sentence. The record is also silent\nas to the nature of the counseling, what Applicant learned from the counseling, and any\nfavorable prognosis resulting from the counseling.\nIn 1993, Applicant, while at a fast food restaurant, exposed himself to a female\ncustomer who was seated at a table (Item 6 at 3; Item 5 at 5). He was arrested and\ncharged with public indecency. Subsequently, he was found guilty. The court deferred\nadjudication for one year, fined him $100, and ordered him to attend counseling (Item 6\nat 2). It is unclear from the record whether he attended the counseling, as ordered, and\nif so, the nature of the counseling.\nIn 1989, Applicant was arrested and charged with indecent exposure. The\ndisposition of the case is unknown from the record.\nIn 1981, Applicant was the subject of a police investigation concerning indecent\nexposure incidents that had occurred in his apartment complex. The FORM contains no\nrecord of the investigation\u2019s outcome. In 1980, Applicant was arrested and charged with\nindecent exposure (Item 3). The record contains no evidence of the case\u2019s disposition.\n\n3\nApplicant acknowledges that he has had sexual behavior problems in the past.\nHe believes that the counseling he attended in 2001 helped him get his problems under\ncontrol (Id.). Since then, he has had no further episodes of exhibitionism (Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (Id.). \nSOR subparagraph 1.a merely alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith indecent exposure. Applicant admits being charged, and the charge is listed in a\nFederal Bureau of Investigation identification record (Item 5). Absent a police report or\nany evidence of the disposition of this charge, however, I cannot adequately evaluate\nwhether the underlying crime occurred. SOR subparagraph 1.a is resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.\n\n4\nSOR subparagraph 1.b merely alleges that Applicant was investigated regarding\nsome indecent exposure incidents. The FORM contains neither any evidence of the\ninvestigation\u2019s outcome, nor any other details about the investigation. Moreover, it\ncontains no evidence of the circumstances surrounding the incident. Given the\nvagueness of the allegation and its age, I did not draw any negative security inferences\nfrom it. SOR subparagraph 1.b is resolved in favor of Applicant. \nThe government does not have to establish that an applicant was convicted to\nsustain an allegation of criminal conduct. However, at minimum, the government must\nsupport its allegations with some evidence that the alleged crime occurred. SOR\nsubparagraph 1.c, like SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, does not meet this minimum\nthreshold; therefore, it is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nNevertheless, the remaining episodes of indecent exposure, as set forth in the\nSOR and admitted by Applicant, are sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca\nsingle serious crime, or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s most recent offense occurred nearly nine years ago, and the earlier\nepisode occurred nearly 16 years ago. The nature of Applicant\u2019s behavior may be\nindicative, however, of a behavioral disorder. Consequently, absent any comprehensive\nevidence regarding the counseling he received in 2001, I cannot adequately gauge the\npossibility of the behavior\u2019s recurrence. Also, Applicant provided no evidence of any\npositive factors demonstrating rehabilitation such as good job performance or\ncommunity involvement that could conceivably bolster his case. Consequently, despite\nthe time that has elapsed since the last offense, I conclude none of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable. \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct security concern.\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nUnder this guideline, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 12). Applicant\u2019s behavior triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a),\n\u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been\nprosecuted,\u201d 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d and 13(d), \u201csexual behavior . . . that reflects a lack of\ndiscretion or judgment.\u201d\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply for the same reasons set forth in the\ncriminal conduct paragraph, above. Applicant has not mitigated the sexual behavior\nsecurity concern.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct was infrequent, and resulted in minor judicial\npenalties, if any. The most recent offense occurred nearly nine years ago. The nature of\nthe conduct, however, reflects a serious lack of judgment and discretion, and may be\nindicative of a behavioral disorder. I was particularly troubled by the 1993 episode of\nindecent exposure which occurred inside a restaurant. Under these circumstances,\nApplicant\u2019s participation in counseling represents a positive effort at rehabilitation, but\nabsent any specific details, does not outweigh the security concerns. After evaluating\nthis case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has failed to\nmitigate the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn August 17, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On May 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under the guidelines for Financial Considerations, Drug Involvement and \nCriminal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nDecember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn July 7, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 17, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing seven \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy. Applicant signed the document \nacknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM on September 29, 2008, and returned it \nto DOHA. He provided no further response to the FORM within the 30-day period he \nwas given to do so, did not request additional time to respond, and made no objection to \nconsideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. I received the case \nassignment on December 12, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in Paragraph 1 \nof the SOR, except those contained in \u00b6 1.g and \u00b6 1.i that he denied. He admitted all \nallegations contained in Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the SOR. All admissions are \nincorporated into the findings herein.   \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and recently divorced from his second wife. He has a \nten-year-old son. In March 2007, he began working as a customer service \nrepresentative for a defense contractor. Prior to this position, he worked for other \nfederal contractors. In August 2007, he submitted an e-QIP. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories relating to his finances \nand drug use.  He attributed his financial problems to medical expenses related to a \nneck injury and his recent divorce from his second wife.  He noted that \u201cI intend to make \narrangements for payment on all debts.\u201d (Item 6 at 44.) The May 2008 SOR alleged that \nhe has nine delinquent debts, totaling $24,006. According to a September 2007 credit \nbureau report (CBR), one of the debts, a tax lien, was filed in 2002. He admitted that he \nowed all but $13,456 of the alleged debts, specifically denying the tax lien for $465 and \na credit union account of $13,000. Said CBR notes that the tax lien is outstanding, but \nthe credit union debt is paid. (Item 7.) He did not provide any information regarding the \nresolution of the remaining $11,000 of delinquent debt or the tax lien. \n \n \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana on a regular \nbasis from April 2001 to September 15, 2007, and used cocaine on a regular basis from \nmid-2000 to March 2001. (Item 4.) He stopped using marijuana after his second arrest \nfor possession of it in September 2007. He was previously arrested for possession of \nsome other type of controlled substance in March 2001 and in April 2001 for possession \nof marijuana.1 (Item 6 at 39.) He pled guilty to the April 2001 charge and was sentenced \nto pay a fine.  He was sentenced to pay a $589 fine on the September 2007 charge. \n \n \nAs of February 2007, Applicant terminated his relationship with those friends with \nwhom he engaged in illegal drug abuse, and later his second wife, who he said is an \n\u201caddict and is a bad influence on me and my child.\u201d (Item 6 at 40.) There is no evidence \n                                                          \n1 The drug charges, along with a domestic abuse charge, filed in March 2001, were entered nolle \nprosequi by the State. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthat he participated in any substance abuse treatment for either his cocaine or \nmarijuana abuse. He acknowledged that his employer utilizes a drug screening \nprogram, although he has never been tested. (Id. at 40.) \u201cSince 9/15/07, I realize, \nunderstand, and vow never again to do drugs or be associated with people, events or \nany circumstances that may be remotely associated with drugs. I\u2019m very, very, sorry.\u201d \n(Id. at 42.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d   \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt that he has \nbeen unable or unwilling to manage or resolve since 2002. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 20 \nprovides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nOther than providing evidence of the resolution of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, \nApplicant did not submit evidence to trigger the application of any of the six mitigating \nconditions to the other debts. The financial problems are on-going, such that AG \u00b6 20(a) \ncannot apply. Although there is some evidence that the debts may be attributable to \nmedical expenses and a divorce, he did not submit evidence to demonstrate that he \nacted financially responsible under those circumstances, as required under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant has not received credit counseling or initiated a good-faith effort to repay or \nresolve his debts, nor shown that his finances are under control, all of which are \nnecessary to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d). Nor is there any \nevidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) or AG \u00b6 20(f).      \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern pertaining to drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and \nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \nhallucinogens), and \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions that he regularly used marijuana from April \n2001 to September 2007 and cocaine from mid-2000 to March 2001, the Government \nraised a disqualification under AG \u00b6 25(a).  \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nillegal drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.   \n Based on an evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n26(a) does not apply. Applicant used marijuana regularly from April 2001 until \nSeptember 2007, the last incident being about a year ago. Given his 6-year history of \nmarijuana use, coupled with his previous year of cocaine use, his behavior does cast \ndoubt on his current trustworthiness and good judgment.   \nApplicant stated that since February 2007 he no longer associates with friends or \nhis ex-wife who used illegal drugs. As those assertions are not corroborated by any \nindependent evidence, only limited application of AG \u00b6 26(b) is warranted. The record \ndoes not contain evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 26(c) or AG \u00b6 26(d). \nApplicant has not sought professional treatment, an evaluation or received a favorable \nprognosis from a qualified medical professional.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this instance: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant repeatedly engaged in illegal substance abuse over a period of \nmore than six years and was arrested on three separate occasions for illegally \npossessing drugs, resulting in two convictions. The Government raised the above \ntwo disqualifications.  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline: \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n Applicant admitted that the last time he used marijuana was in September \n2007, and the last time he used cocaine was in April 2001. Given that the last \ntime he used marijuana was about a year ago and that he did not submit any \nindependent evidence to verify his assertions, AG \u00b6 32(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant was not coerced into using illegal drugs, so AG \u00b6 32(b) has no \napplication. AG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s admissions and \ncriminal record support the allegations regarding his illegal drug offenses. \nDespite a long history of serious substance abuse, Applicant has not sought any \nform of professional substance abuse rehabilitation, which would be pertinent to \nthe allegations raised under this guideline and Guideline H. Although he stated \nremorse over his previous conduct, it is insufficient to outweigh his history of \ncriminal conduct considering that he used illegal drugs while working for the \nfederal government that has a drug-free policy, and after completing a security \nclearance application. AG \u00b6 32(d) has no application.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 32-year-old man, who \nbegan using marijuana in 2001 and continued using it until September 2007, after he \ncompleted an e-QIP that inquires into ones illegal drug abuse. In addition, he also used \ncocaine from mid-2000 to March 2001. While I find his candid admissions of his drug \nuse noteworthy, his assertions that he will not use illegal drugs in the future are not very \nconvincing in view of the absence of any evidence that he has taken steps to address \nhis long history of substance abuse. The fact that he chose to use marijuana after \nsubmitting a security clearance application is troublesome and indicative of a lack of \ngood judgment.  \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant stated that he intended to resolve the delinquent debts \nthat were concerning the Government. Despite having a couple months to do so, he did \nnot take actions to follow through on his assertion, providing another indication of his \nlack of reliability and good judgment, \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with significant questions as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations, drug involvement and criminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Goldstein Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 10, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\n  \nThe Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) on May 23, 2007.  On March 12, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on March 24, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on April 29, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 12, 2008, and\nthe hearing was scheduled for June 9, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\nseven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7.  The Applicant\npresented four exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D.  He also\ntestified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 17, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 62 years old and has a Masters in\nInformation Technology, and is currently working on his PhD.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor as a Senior Business Systems Analyst and is seeking to obtain a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  He is indebted to six separate creditors totalling approximately $ 49,000.00.\nCredit reports of the Applicant dated April 16, 2008, February 12, 2008, January 30,\n2008, and June 14, 2007, reflect each of these delinquent debts.  (See Government\nExhibits 3, 4,  5, and 6).\nFrom 1964 to 1974, the Applicant was in the Air Force and held a DoD security\nclearance.  He has been divorced twice, and has one adult child.  Over time, the\nApplicant ran up his credit cards for personal usage, including travel expenses, and\nincurred a substantial amount of debt.  In 2000, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer\nand was treated for his disease until 2003.  He had medical insurance, but some of the\nco-pays for medication he was required to pay himself.  In October 2006, he was laid off\nfrom his job for six weeks.  Although he received a severance package from his\nemployer, he did not use the money to pay his bills because he was unsure how long he\nwould be unemployed.  At that time he contacted his creditors and also a consumer\ncredit counsellor to assist him in consolidating his debt.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C\nand D). Several of the creditors refused to consolidate or negociate a settlement and\nhave demanded payment in full.\n \nIn September 2007, with the assistance of the consumer credit counsellor, the\nApplicant was able to start a payment plan toward a debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $24,000.00.  The agreement requires that the Applicant pay the creditor\n$418.00 monthly until the debt is completely paid off, which is scheduled to take about\nthree years.  In January 2008, the Applicant started making monthly payments in the\namount of $500.00 to another creditor for a debt owed in the amount of $5,948.00.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\n\n3\nAt least three other delinquent debts totalling in excess of at least $20,000.00\nremain outstanding and have not been addressed.  A debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $5,344.00, a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $8,892.00, and a debt\nowed to a creditor in the amount of $7,289.00 remain outstanding. \nThe Applicant is current with all of his regular monthly expenses.  He has a\n401(k) with $82,000.00 and a savings account with approximately $500.00.  The\nApplicant has destroyed all of his credit cards, except for a gas card that he pays on a\nmonthly basis.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.\u00a9\n a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the\nfollowing general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n\n4\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \nI.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2\nof Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nto grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is\nthe careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\n\n5\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that although the Applicant suffered a serious illness from\n2000-2003, and a job lay-of in 2006, the impact of these events did not adversely effect\nhis financial situation. He had medical insurance to pay most of his medical bills, and\nwas given a severance package when he was laid off, equal to his pay for the period he\nwas out of work.  In this case, the Applicant abused his credit cards and incurred a\nsubstantial amount of debt that he initially could not afford to pay, and later chose not to\npay.  Although he contacted a consumer credit counsellor for assistance, they have only\nbeen able to help him with two of his creditors.  He remains indebted to at least three,\npossibly four other creditors in the amount of at least $20,000.00 that he has not begun\nto address.   Furthermore, the Applicant has resources that he could use to pay his\ndelinquent debts, including a savings account and a 401(k) but has chosen not to use\nthem.         \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19.\u00a9 a history of not meeting financial\nobligations are applicable.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  His financial\nproblems remain current, they are not isolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a\nprompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  The Applicant has only just begun the process of financial rehabilitation\nand he has a long way to go before his financial affairs are in order.    \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \n\n6\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on May 19, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to an\nadministrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this\ncase fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial\nproblems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n See Applicant\u2019s testimony on the individual debts (Tr. 42\u201355). \n3\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on June 16, 2008, and\nshe requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on August 13, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nAugust 21 3, 2008.\nThe record was left open until August 27, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit additional documentary evidence. She did so, and those matters are admitted,\nwithout objections, as follows: (1) Exhibit E\u2013monthly budget; and (2) Exhibit F\u2013petition\nfor divorce. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges ten delinquent debts for about $29,000 in\ntotal. She admitted the ten debts in her Answer. Based on the record evidence as a\nwhole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for\nher current employer since 2006. Her position or title is supply technician, and her\nduties involve the purchasing of equipment, supplies, and materials. Three fellow\nemployees (the program manager, the administrative manager, and the industrial\nsecurity manager) have high regard for her ability to perform her job and all three\nrecommend her for a security clearance (Exhibit B). \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which she does not dispute. It\nappears all the delinquent debts in the SOR are marital debts. The debts include two\nauto loans that ended in repossession, consumer debts, medical bills, and a utility bill.3\nShe married in 1989, and she and her husband have three children, ages 18, 16,\nand 12. They separated for about three weeks in 2005, but reconciled. They separated\nin October 2006 with the intention of ending the marriage. She has filed a petition for\ndivorce and she thinks the divorce will be final within the next several months (Exhibit\nF). The divorce petition does not address who will be responsible for specific debts\n(Exhibit F at 2). But it does indicate that the parties will try to reach an agreement on\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n3\nhow the debts are divided, and it also asks the court to decide the issue if they cannot\nagree. Applicant is not seeking spousal maintenance, but she is asking the court to\norder her husband to pay child support. Her husband is yet to make any interim child\nsupport payments, but he lives nearby and is providing financial assistance on an as\nneeded basis (Tr. 57). \nShe has not paid, settled, or resolved the debts in the SOR except for the debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.i, which concerns a debt for $5,773 for membership in a vacation network (Tr.\n32). The membership was cancelled, and the company is in the process of making\nrepayment with an anticipated refund payment on or about May 2009 (Exhibit A).    \nHer intention or plan is to address the debts through a debt-consolidation\nprogram once her divorce is final (Tr. 55\u201357). She believes she could afford to make\n$200 monthly payments, and her current monthly budget supports her belief as it shows\na remainder of about $575 (Exhibit E). In addition to the monthly remainder, Applicant\nestimated that she had about $700 to $800 in the bank and about $7,000 in a 401(k)\naccount (Tr. 61\u201363). She pays her regular bills online or with a debit card. She believes\nthe primary factor for the financial problems was the \u201ccrumbling\u201d marriage, and she\nbelieves both she and her husband share the blame (Tr. 66). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions). \n4\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\n\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n5\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n17\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n18\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. And the same evidence\nsupports a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered. In particular, MC\n2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s control\u2014has some potential application based\n\n6\non Applicant\u2019s separation and her pending divorce. But Applicant has not made any\nprogress in resolving the debts (except for the vacation network membership). Given\nthe lack of forward progress, although she is in a difficult spot, Applicant has not acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nAnother potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to initiate\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Based on the\nrecord evidence, her efforts are not enough to qualify as a good-faith effort. What is\nmissing here is: (1) a realistic and workable plan; (2) documented actions taken in\nfurtherance of the plan; and (3) a measurable improvement to the situation. Her future\nplan to resolve her share of the marital debts through a debt-consolidation program\nsounds reasonable, but it too soon to tell at this point as the divorce is still pending. Like\nher marriage, her financial situation is up in the air. This uncertainly makes it impossible\nto determine if Applicant will successfully resolve her financial problems as well as to\ndetermine the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of financial problems. Given these\ncircumstances, MC 4 does not apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nFinally, MC 5 applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. She provided documentary evidence\nshowing that the debt for the vacation network membership will be resolved (Exhibit A).\nOn this basis, a favorable finding for SOR \u00b6 1.i is appropriate. \nOn balance, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.h, 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on May 26, 2006. On April 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 8, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on May 20, 2008, and I received the case assignment on May 28, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 5, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 26, \n2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, identified by \nList of Government Exhibits (Ex. I), which were received without objection. Applicant \noffered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were received without objection, \nand she testified on her own behalf.   \n \nI held the record open until July 11, 2008 to afford the Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted AE E through L without \nobjection, which were forwarded to me by Department Counsel by Memorandum, \ndated July 11, 2008 (Ex. II). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July \n3, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nThe Government submitted a Stipulation dated May 20, 2008, stating that \nApplicant has paid or otherwise satisfied debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.d., 1.g., and \n1.i. \u2013 1.l. The stipulation further stated that Applicant has made partial payments \nand/or entered into payment arrangements with creditors listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.e., 1.h. \nand that Applicant has made payments on the debt in 1.f. since October 2006, and as \nof January 8, 2008, had a balance of $16,850. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.h. She denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., \n1.d., 1.g., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., and 1.n. Her admissions and Stipulations supra are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old old information assurance analyst, who has been \nemployed by her defense contractor employer since May 2006. GE 1, Tr. 20. She \nseeks to renew her security clearance, which is a requirement to maintain her \nemployment. Tr. 19, 22. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1994. GE 1, Tr. 17. She served in \nthe U.S. Army from May 1996 to July 2005, and was honorably discharged as a \nSergeant (pay grade E-5). Her Military Occupational Specialty while in the Army was \n74B \u2013 Information Systems Operator \u2013 Analyst. GE 1, Tr. 20-22. Applicant was \ngranted a secret security clearance in approximately May 1996 while in the Army, and \nhas successfully held a clearance since then without incident. Tr. 21-22.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has never been married, and is a single mother of a seven-year-old \nson. She receives $348 child support per month from her son\u2019s father. Tr. 16-17, 41-\n42. Applicant is attending college on a part-time basis and estimates she has earned \n54 to 56 credit hours towards a bachelor of science degree in information systems. Tr. \n17-18. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her May 2006 e-QIP, her November 2007 Personal Financial \nStatement, December 2005 and March 2006 judgments, and her July 2006, \nNovember 2007 and May 2008 credit reports. GE 1, GE 3 - 8. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 14 separate line items. As the Government\u2019s \nStipulation notes supra, debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.d., 1.g., 1.i. 1.l., have been \npaid or otherwise satisfied. The Stipulation also reflects that Applicant has made \npartial payments and/or entered into payment arrangements with creditors alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.e., and 1.h., and has made payments totaling $9,640 since October \n2006 to the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. with a balance of $16,850 as of January \n2008. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.m., and 1.n. are the same debt. Applicant remains current on all \ndebts in which she made payment arrangements with creditors. Tr. 34-40. \n \nApplicant paid or otherwise resolved 10 of the 14 debts alleged, and three of \nthe four remaining debts alleged were the same debt as noted supra. Before the \nhearing commenced, only one debt had not been resolved, the collection account debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. With regard to that debt Applicant appeared at her hearing with \ndocumentation that that account had been settled and closed as reflected by creditor \nletter dated June 23, 2008. AE A. Tr. 23-25. \n \nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to a family medical emergency that \narose in 2005 and continued into 2006. Her oldest sister\u2019s daughter developed a \ngrowth on her brain, which required surgery. Applicant\u2019s sister had to take leave from \nher job to care for her daughter. Applicant provided financial and emotional support to \nher sister for 1 \u00bd years and as a result, she was unable to remain current on her own \nbills. Tr. 13, 25-26, 44, 31-32. \n \nApplicant has established a budget with the assistance of a friend, who is a \nfinancial consultant. Her annual income is $83,172, which includes her salary, child \nsupport, and disability pay from the Veteran\u2019s Administration. Her net monthly \nremainder is $2,400. AE L. \n \nApplicant provided a letter from her older sister, who stated \u201c. . . I would not \nhave made it without the help of my family including my sister [Applicant]. She \ncontributed financially and emotionally toward my family. I didn\u2019t know it was a strain \non her because she never said anything to me at that time.\u201d AE H. Applicant also \nsubmitted a letter from the financial consultant, who outlined a strategy that has \nallowed Applicant to return to financial stability. AE I. Her 2007 and 2008 work \nperformance evaluations reflect above average performance. AE J, AE K. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern is \nthat an Applicant\u2019s: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial considerations concerns were established by her \nadmissions and the Government\u2019s evidence. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties stem from \nthe financial assistance she provided to her older sister during her daughter illness \nduring 2005 and 2006. Applicant\u2019s sister did not have the financial means to work and \nprovide the necessary care for her daughter. Applicant shored up her sister\u2019s budget \nshortfalls, but at a considerable expense to herself. As a result, she was unable to pay \nher own bills. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions listed under \nGuideline \u00b6 19, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d \nand \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nWhen the hearing convened, Applicant had paid or otherwise resolved all but \none of 14 debts alleged in the SOR. When she appeared at her hearing, she produced \ndocumentation that she had resolved that one remaining debt. She remains current on \naccounts for which she is making payments. She has sought financial counseling and \nhas a net monthly remainder of $2,240. Her financial difficulties stem from her choice \nto provide financial assistance to her sister during a difficult time. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude three of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 20 are applicable or \npartially applicable: \u00b6 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d \u00b6 20 (c) \u201cthe person has received or is \n \n1 Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control;\u201d and \u00b6 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.n.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: 2 Applicant is a 40-year-old single man who has been employed as a \u201cbaser\u201d by a defense contractor since January 2001. He was employed as a \u201ccutter\u201d outside the defense industry from June 1995 to June 2000. He was unemployed from July 2000 to January 2001. There is no information in the file concerning his educational background. He did not report having any dependents. Applicant\u2019s credit reports and his admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR establish he has six accounts, totalling $6,635, that were submitted for collection, one account, owing in the amount of $679, that was charged off as a bad debt, and two accounts, totalling $4,402, that resulted in judgments being entered against him. The 3 credit reports indicate the collection accounts were submitted for collection at various times between September 2001 and June 2007.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concern that arises from his financial\nirresponsibility as demonstrated by the many debts he has allowed to remain delinquent\nfor a number of years.  \nOn April 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and\nGuideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, dated June\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nNovember 5, 2008\n\n In addition to the SOR and Applicant\u2019s response, the attachments to the FORM consist of a security\n2\nclearance application, two credit reports, Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement, a wage stub and several\ncomputer printouts concerning two judgments that have been recorded against Applicant.   \n The identity of the creditors and the amount owing on the charged off account alleged in SOR\n3\nsubparagraph 1.c and the judgment alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d are identical. Department Counsel\nconceded in the FORM these appear to be duplicate allegations of the same account. Thus, SOR\nsubparagraph 1.c will be found for Applicant.\n2\n5, 2008, in which he admitted all Guideline F allegations and denied the sole Guideline E\nallegation. He requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a\nhearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 28, 2008,\nthat was mailed to Applicant on July 31, 2008. Applicant was notified he had 30 days from\nreceipt of the FORM to submit his objections thereto or any additional information he\nwanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on August 11, 2008. He\ndid not respond to the FORM, object to anything contained in the FORM, or submit any\nadditional information he wanted considered within the time provided to him. The case was\nassigned to me on October 10, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits,  I make the following findings of fact:\n2\nApplicant is a 40-year-old single man who has been employed as a \u201cbaser\u201d by a\ndefense contractor since January 2001. He was employed as a \u201ccutter\u201d outside the\ndefense industry from June 1995 to June 2000. He was unemployed from July 2000 to\nJanuary 2001. There is no information in the file concerning his educational background.\nHe did not report having any dependents. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports and his admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR\nestablish he has six accounts, totalling $6,635, that were submitted for collection, one\naccount, owing in the amount of $679, that was charged off as a bad debt, and two\naccounts, totalling $4,402, that resulted in judgments being entered against him.  The\n3\ncredit reports indicate the collection accounts were submitted for collection at various times\nbetween September 2001 and June 2007. The judgments were recorded in September\n2003 and April 2005.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant stated: \u201cI am in the process of getting my\ndebts consolidated and intend to pay them off.\u201d On the bottom of the personal financial\nstatement he submitted, Applicant indicated he was making payments to a debt counseling\nservice and stated: \u201c$270.00 payments as of today 203.00\" He provided no other\ninformation about his contractual relationship with the counseling service, what debts, if\nany, of those alleged in the SOR might be included in any repayment plan he may have\nagreed to with the counseling service, or what are the terms of any repayment plan he may\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n7\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n10\n3\nhave entered into with the counseling service. Most importantly, he provided no information\nabout why he allowed the debts alleged in the SOR to become or remain delinquent.  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified the security clearance application\nhe submitted in June 2007, by failing to disclose the two judgments that had been entered\nagainst him. However, he did disclose in that security clearance application that his wages\nhad been garnished and that he had accounts that were more than 90 and more than 180\ndays past due.  \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct), with their respective DC and MC, are\nmost relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,\n6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n Id at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n12\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has six accounts, totalling $6,635, that have been submitted for collection,\nand two accounts, totalling $4,402, that have resulted in judgments being entered against\nhim. Those accounts have been delinquent for many years ranging as far back as\nSeptember 2001. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. \nApplicant failed to provide any explanation for the delinquent debts. His security\nclearance application discloses a six-month period of unemployment in 2000, However, the\nunemployment occurred in many cases long before any of the debts alleged in the SOR\nbecame delinquent. Further, he has been continuously employed since January 2001,\nduring which time all of the alleged debts became delinquent. Thus, Mitigating Condition\n(MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances does not apply. \nApplicant asserted in his response to the SOR that he was consolidating and\nintended to satisfy his debts. He made entries on the personal financial statement he\nsubmitted that may indicate he has contracted with a debt consulting service and may be\nmaking payments on his debts through that service. However, the entries are so vague and\nincomplete that it is impossible to conclude he has actually entered into a repayment plan\nthat includes the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR or that he has made continuous\npayments under any plan he may have entered into. Accordingly, MC 20(c): the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control; and 20(d): the individual initiated a good-\n\n5\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts do not apply. The\nremaining mitigating conditions have no applicability to the facts of this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the (sensitive position eligibility) process or any failure to cooperate with\nthe (sensitive position eligibility) process.\nApplicant failed to disclose the two judgments that were entered against him, as\nrequired, in the security clearance application he submitted in June 2007. However, he did\ndisclose the adverse financial information about his wages being garnished and accounts\nthat were more than 90 and 180 days past due. In his response to the SOR, Applicant\nstated the omission about the judgments was due to his not understanding the question.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s explanation and the adverse financial information he did disclose,\nI conclude Applicant did not deliberately fail to disclose the judgments. \n \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions.\nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns caused by the financial considerations that are present in this case. He\nhas not overcome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It\nis not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                            \nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n\n7\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Clearance is granted.\nOn September 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 10, 2008, and requested an\nadministrative determination. On January 14, 2009, department counsel prepared a File\nof Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant received it on January 21, 2009, and did not\nreply. The case was assigned to me on March 24, 2009.\nApril 24, 2009\n\n2\nEvidentiary Ruling\nAt department counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of the facts set forth\nin 13 documents included in the FORM. I shall reference the administrative notice\ndocuments in the FORM using Roman numerals.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old married, man with two children, ages 14 and eight. He\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002 (Item 3 at 3). He was originally a citizen of the\nRepublic of India. He lived in the U.S. for five years before becoming a naturalized\ncitizen.\nApplicant attended graduate school in the U.S. from 1985 to 1986, earning a\nMaster\u2019s Degree in Business Administration. After finishing business school, Applicant\nmoved to Kuwait and worked for a privately held trading and contracting company (Item\n4, SOR \u00b6 1.e). It conducted business with the Hussein regime of Iraq before the 1990\ninvasion (Id.). Applicant maintains contact with one of his colleagues with whom he\nworked in Kuwait (Item 4, SOR \u00b6 1.f). The colleague continues to reside in Kuwait.\nApplicant worked in Kuwait through 1997, then returned to the U.S. Between\n1997 and 2001, he worked for two companies as an accountant (Item 8 at 9). Since\n2001, he has worked for a defense contractor as a principal cost and schedule analyst\n(Item 8 at 8).\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and she is originally from India (Item\n4 at 1; Item 6 at 5). She is a homemaker. She has been a U.S. citizen since 1990 (Id.).\nBoth of their children are U.S. citizens by birth. Applicant and his wife were married in\n1990 in the U.S. (Item 5 at 12).\nApplicant\u2019s mother emigrated to the U.S. in July 2005, and is a registered legal\nalien (Item 4, SOR \u00b6 1.b). She is a citizen of India. Before moving to the U.S., she lived\nin Kuwait from 1981 to 2005 where she worked for an airline company as a sales\nsupervisor (Items 3 at 16; 7 at 4). Applicant\u2019s contact with his mother is unknown from\nthe record.\nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of India (Item 4, SOR \u00b6 1.c). He lives\nin a city on the northwestern coast. He lived in Kuwait from 1947 to 1990, working as an\nadministrative manager for a Kuwaiti oil company (Item 7 at 4). He is 77 years old.\nThere is no record evidence as to whether he is currently employed. Applicant speaks\nwith his father by phone periodically (Item 7 at 4). He travels to India approximately\nevery two years to visit (Item 6 at 5). Applicant feels obligated to take care of his affairs,\n\u201cif anything were to happen\u201d to him (Item 7 at 11).\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a citizen of India who lives in the U.S. (Item 4, SOR \u00b6 1.i).\nShe emigrated to the U.S. in 2004 and is a registered legal alien. Their contact is\nunknown from the record.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is originally from India (Item 4, SOR \u00b6 1.h). She\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1986 (Item 5 at 22). The amount of contact\nApplicant has with his mother-in-law is unknown from the record.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, an Indian citizen, has been living in the U.S. since 1979\n(Item 4, SOR \u00b6 1.g; Item 5 at 21). He is a registered legal alien. Applicant\u2019s contact with\nhim is unknown from the record.\nApplicant has two cousins who live in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Item 4,\nSOR \u00b6 1.d). There is conflicting record evidence as to whether they are UAE citizens or\nUnited Kingdom citizens (Item 6 at 4).\nIndia is a multiparty, parliamentary, secular democracy with a population of 1.1\nbillion (Item II). It has 28 states and seven union territories. U.S. and Indian relations\nhave strengthened during the past 10 years (Item I at 11). Before then, their relationship\nwas strained because India had developed nuclear weapons in contravention of\ninternational conventions, (Item I at 11; Item III at 18).\nCurrently, the U.S. is India\u2019s largest trading partner (Item I at 6). Also, the U.S. is\nIndia\u2019s largest investment partner, and provides $126 million in annual development\nassistance (Id.). In 2004, the U.S. and India launched the Next Steps in Strategic\nPartnership (NSSP), an agreement which governed multiple initiatives involving, among\nother things, energy, trade, democracy promotion, and disaster relief (Item I at 11).\nThe growth of the U.S. and India\u2019s economic ties has been accompanied by a\ncorresponding growth in their strategic relationship. In 2005, \u201ca U.S. - India Joint\nStatement asserted that \u2018as a responsible state with advanced nuclear technology, India\nshould acquire the same benefits and advantages as other such states\u2019\u201d (Item III at 6).\nIn 2006, Congress passed the Henry J. Hyde United States - India Peaceful Atomic\nCooperation Act, which allows direct civilian nuclear commerce with India for the first\ntime in 30 years (Item I at 11). This agreement \u201copens the door\u201d for American and\nIndian firms to participate in each other\u2019s civil energy sector (Item I at 12). Specifically, it\nenables India to buy U.S. nuclear reactors and fuel for civilian use. Also, it removed\nand/or revised several U.S. export requirements for dual-use and civil nuclear items\n(Item III at 41).\nSince 2002, the U.S. and India have held a series of \u201cunprecedented and\nincreasingly substantive\u201d combined exercises involving all military services (Item III at\n51). These exercises have enabled the U.S. to get a \u201cfirst look\u201d at fighter jets that\nRussia designed and sold to India (Id.). More than 100 U.S. Special Forces soldiers\nhave undergone counter insurgency jungle warfare training conducted by the Indian\n\n4\nmilitary. For the past seven years, the U.S. and Indian navies have participated in joint\nnaval exercises conducted near the Indian coast (Id.).\nIndia purchases more weapons systems than any other developing country (Item\nIII at 50). India purchases the majority of its weapons systems from Russia and Israel\n(Item III at 50). The U.S. began selling weapons systems to India in 2002. In 2007, a\nU.S. defense contractor negotiated a $1 billion dollar deal with India for the purchase of\nmilitary transport aircraft along with related equipment, training and services (Item III at\n48). In January 2008, the U.S. approved the deal (Id.). Currently, U.S. defense\ncontractors are competing with weapons manufacturers from other countries for a\ncontract to sell multi-role, combat aircraft to India (Item III at 52). The deal when\nconsummated \u201ccould be worth\u201d $10 billion (Id.).\nIndia has a positive relationship with Iran investing nearly $10 billion in the\nIranian economy since 2000 (Item III at 30). India \u201cfirmly opposes the emergence of any\nnew nuclear powers in the region\u201d (Id.).\nIndia and Israel are engaging in joint, new missile technology development. In\n2008, India launched into space an Israeli military satellite (Item III at 50). This elicited a\nformal complaint from the Iranian government which contended that the satellite will be\nused to monitor its nuclear program (Id. at 50, footnote 155).\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security maintains an\nEntity List composed of end-users who have been determined to present an\nunacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the development of weapons of mass\ndestruction or their means of delivery. The Bureau of Industry and Security also\nregulates dual-use technologies that may have military applications. U.S. firms seeking\nto conduct business with organizations on the Entity List must obtain licenses from the\nBureau of Industry and Security (Item XI).\nAs of 2000, India\u2019s Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and its Nuclear Power\nCorporation (NPC) were on the Entity List (Item XII). As of 2002, Bharat Dynamics, an\nIndian-based corporation, was on the Entity List (Item XIII). As of 2004, the Indian\nSpace Research Organization\u2019s Space Applications Center was on the Entity List (Item\nXI). As of 2007, the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research was on the Entity List\n(Item VIII). Hindustan Aeronautics, an Indian company, was on the Entity List in 1998\n(Item IX). The U.S. removed it from the List in 2001 (Id.).\nIn July 2007, the U.S. and India successfully negotiated an agreement on\npeaceful nuclear cooperation. This deal is more far-reaching than the Hyde Act (Item III\nat 7). In August 2007, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved the\nagreement. It has not yet been approved by the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group, a\ngroup composed of countries that have nuclear energy capabilities who must approve\nsuch an agreement under international law (Item II at 6). As of the U.S. election of 2008,\nneither the U.S. Congress nor the Indian parliament had ratified the agreement (Id. at 4-\n7).\n\n5\nIndia is one of the most terror-afflicted countries in the world (Item IV at 3). In\n2008, more than 2300 people died from terrorist incidents in India (Id.). Terrorism is\nconcentrated in Kashmir, a disputed area bordering Pakistan where radical Muslim\nactivists are present, central India, where Maoist rebels are fighting on behalf of\nlandless laborers, and southern India, where Hindus and Muslims periodically clash\n(Item III at 73-75).\nIndia considers defeating terrorism and combating violent religious extremism as\na critical shared security interest with the U.S. (Item III at 55). In 2000, the U.S. and\nIndia formed a joint working group on counterterrorism. It meets annually and is devoted\nto extending cooperation on areas such as bioterrorism, aviation security, cyber-\nsecurity, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and terrorist financing (Item\nIII at 55). In 2002, the U.S. and India organized a cyber security forum to safeguard\ncritical infrastructures from attack (Item III at 35).\nIn 2005, the U.S. and India signed a treaty on criminal matters institutionalizing\nlaw enforcement cooperation and creating regularized channels for mutual assistance\n(Item III at 54). It was subsequently ratified (Id. at footnote 174). Counterinsurgency\nefforts have improved as the U.S. has provided training to local Indian police forces\n(Id.).\nHundreds of Indian commandos are stationed in Afghanistan assisting U.S.\ntroops (Item III at 33). India has committed approximately $1.2 billion toward\nAfghanistan\u2019s reconstruction (Id.). In 2008, the Taliban bombed India\u2019s embassy in\nAfghanistan in an effort to force their withdrawal from the country. In response, India\nremained involved in Afghanistan, and pledged an additional $450 million dollars to the\nwar and reconstruction efforts (Id.).\nIndia generally respects the rights of its citizens. (Item II at 1). It has a vibrant civil\nsociety, a free press, and a robust, democratic, political system (Item II at 14; Item III at\n36). However, its judiciary is only \u201csomewhat effective\u201d (Id.). India has numerous laws\nprotecting human rights, but lacks a coherent, well-developed mechanism to enforce\nthem. Serious problems exist including extrajudicial killings of persons in custody,\ndisappearances, and torture by police forces (Item II at 2).\nIndian immigrants are the fastest growing legal group of immigrants in the U.S.\n(Item III at 20). The Indian-American community is well-entrenched in several U.S.\nbusiness sectors (Id.). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 explains the foreign influence security concern as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nThe government alleges that the status of Applicant\u2019s relatives as Indian citizens\nand/or residents generates foreign influence security concerns. Also, the government\nalleges that Applicant\u2019s prior employment with a company in Kuwait, and his continuing\nassociation with friends who remain employed there, and relatives who live in Kuwait\ngenerates a security risk.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is no longer an Indian citizen. She is now a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen. I find for Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.a.\n\n7\nAlthough India is not a paragon of democracy, it is certainly not a hostile,\ntotalitarian state seeking to project its power worldwide through the brute intimidation or\ncoercion of its citizens domestically and abroad. Consequently, none of Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives who are Indian citizens living in the U.S. generate security risks. I have\nresolved SOR subparagraphs 1.b, and 1.g through 1.I in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant has no cousins residing in Kuwait, as alleged in the SOR. It is unclear\nfrom the record, whether they are citizens of the UAE or the U.K. Absent any SOR\nallegations concerning these countries, I conclude that these relationships do not\ngenerate a security risk. SOR subparagraph 1.d is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nA \u201ccurrent and accurate assessment of the \u2018geopolitical situation\u2019 and the\nsecurity/intelligence profile of the [foreign] country vis-a-vis the United States is crucial\nin Guideline B cases\u201d (ISCR Case No. 07-05686 at 4, n. 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2005)).\nHere, the government\u2019s allegations of a security risk generated by Applicant\u2019s past\nemployment with a privately owned, Kuwaiti company, and continuing friendship with a\ncurrent employee are unsupported by any record evidence concerning Kuwait\u2019s\ngeopolitical situation. Moreover, the company conducted business with Iraq\u2019s Hussein\nregime nearly 20 years ago, before it invaded Kuwait. I conclude the allegations listed in\nsubparagraph 1.e and 1.f do not generate security risks.\nIn evaluating whether Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father living in India\ngenerates a security risk, a comparison of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines and the\nearlier edition of the Adjudicative Guidelines governing foreign influence is instructive.\nUnder the earlier edition, any contact with a family member residing in a foreign country\ngenerated a security risk (DODD 5220.6, E.2.A.2.1.2.1 (January 2, 1992)). Moreover,\nthe Appeal Board in interpreting \u00b6 E.2.A.2.1.2.1 of the pre-revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines held that the existence of one relative living in a foreign country, with whom\nan applicant had contacts, was enough, alone, to generate a potential for compromise\nof classified information (ISCR Case No. 03-02382 (App. Bd., Feb. 8, 2001)). \nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines changed \u00b6 E.2.A.2.1.2.1. Now, the contact\nwith the foreign family member generates a security risk only if the contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, pressure or coercion (AG \u00b6 7(a)).\nSecurity clearance decisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards (See\nISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003). Because the Appeal Board\u2019s\nforeign influence analysis regarding foreign relatives, as described in the previous\nparagraph, was predicated on the pre-revised guideline, it no longer has any\nprecedential value (See ISCR Case No. 02-17369 at 3-4 (App. Bd., May 23, 2006)). \nDepartment counsel argues that Indian agents are known to target citizens to\nobtain protected information. In support of this contention, she references five instances\nin which the government either fined or prosecuted U.S. companies for selling dual-use\ntechnology to India in contravention of the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of\nIndustry and Security\u2019s regulations (BIS). None of the Administrative Notice Documents\nthat detail these episodes (Items IX-XIII) referenced agents of the Indian government.\n\n8\nAbsent any evidence of Indian government complicity these cases appear more\ndemonstrative of the greed and duplicity of the U.S. companies that attempted to\ncircumvent the regulatory scheme governing such transactions rather than any\nindustrial espionage on the part of the Indian government. In reaching this conclusion, I\nconsidered the lucrative and competitive nature of the Indian market for high technology\nproducts and weapons systems. \nAlthough none of the cases that the government referenced detailed examples of\nthe Indian government targeting dual use technology, two cases involved an Indian\nbusiness, and a multinational company with an Indian office that were charged,\nrespectively, with circumventing U.S. export control regulations (Items VII - VIII). Also,\nthe inclusion of several Indian government agencies and businesses on the BIS list of\nforeign entities that may \u201cpose a significant risk of being involved in activities that are\ncontrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the U.S.,\u201d (15 C.F.R \u00a7\n744.11(b)), must be considered in the heightened risk analysis. The BIS does not\nprohibit U.S. companies from selling dual-use technologies to foreign government\nagencies and companies on the Entity List. Instead, it regulates the commerce (15\nC.F.R. \u00a7 730.6.2(5)). U.S. companies seeking to conduct business with entities on the\nList must apply for a license. There is a \u201cpresumption of approval\u201d for license\napplications to sell dual-use technologies to the Indian entities on the list (15 C.F.R., Pt.\n744, supp. 4).\nNevertheless, evidence that an Indian business and a multinational business with\nan office in the U.S. and India have attempted to circumvent U.S. export regulations to\nacquire protected technologies generates a risk of inducement or coercion. However,\nthis risk is balanced against the 2005 U.S. - India Joint Statement, the countries\u2019\nextensive military and law enforcement cooperation, and their rapidly growing\ncooperation on issues involving sensitive technologies.\nThe risk of terrorism in India is also a factor to consider in assessing the security\nrisk. Over the past five years, India has been victimized by brazen and spectacular\nepisodes of terrorism. Terrorism, however, is often indiscriminate by nature. The\npossibility that it may be employed against specific individuals, such as the family\nmember of a security clearance holder, is higher in countries that openly espouse it, are\nhostile to the U.S., or are controlled partially by terrorist organizations. None of these\ncharacteristics apply to India. Although the contested border with Pakistan is a\nflashpoint for terrorism, and pockets of central and southern India experience terrorism\nstimulated by ethnic and political unrest, these factors are counterbalanced by India\u2019s\nfirm commitment to countering terrorism, both domestically and internationally, and its\nrobust democratic system. Over the years, India has sought U.S. counterterrorism\nassistance and provided counterterrorism assistance to the U.S. Also, it is playing a\ncrucial role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, and has been unfazed by the Taliban\u2019s\nviolent efforts to compel its withdrawal.\nIndia\u2019s relationship with the U.S. is as close as it has been in its 60 years of\nindependence. In the 1990s, the major point of contention was development of India\u2019s\n\n9\nnuclear program. Now, the U.S., under the Hyde Act, is engaging in civilian nuclear\ncommerce with India for the first time in 30 years. India and the U.S. have some\nsignificant foreign policy differences, particularly with respect to Iran. Generally,\nhowever, India\u2019s foreign policy and strategic interests are congruent with those of the\nU.S.\nUpon examining Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father together with India\u2019s\nsecurity/intelligence profile vis a vis the U.S., I conclude that AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d does not apply. \nAssuming for the sake of argument that AG \u00b6 7(a) applies, it is mitigated by AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 8(a), the nature of the relationships with the foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government, and\nthe interests of the U.S.,\u201d and 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s father is an elderly, retired oil company\nadministrator who spent his career in Kuwait before returning to India. It is unlikely given\nhis father\u2019s status, India\u2019s positive relationship with the U.S., and generally democratic\nsociety, that India would attempt to coerce or induce Applicant to compromise U.S.\nnational security through his relationship with his father. Moreover, Applicant received\nhis graduate school education in the U.S. nearly 25 years ago, was married in the U.S.\nnearly 20 years ago, and has two children who were both born in the U.S., and has\nbeen working in the U.S. for approximately 12 years. His father is his only relative who\ncontinues to live in India.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n10\nUpon evaluating the innocuous nature of Applicant\u2019s contact with his father, together\nwith India\u2019s emergence as a staunch U.S. ally, its commitment to democracy, and its\nincreasingly expanding economic and security ties with the U.S., I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the foreign influence security concern. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nOn April 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant provided a written undated answer to the SOR and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on August 7, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 11, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on September 3, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n18, which were admitted. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through D, \nwhich were admitted. One witness testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The record was held \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence, which he did and it \nwas marked as AE E through I. Department Counsel offered a memorandum marked as \nGE 19 and did not object to the additional documents. They were admitted and the \nrecord was closed. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 11, \n2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. He \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.i. He failed to answer the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and graduated from high school in 1989. He became a \nsecurity guard in 1996. He has had a secret clearance since approximately 2001. \nApplicant lives at home with his parents. He is not married. He has two daughters ages \n14 and 4.  \n \n \nApplicant has a tax lien that was filed against him by the federal government in \nApril 2007, for $16,630. He stated that he was granted a \u201chardship\u201d by the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence to support \nhis claim. He stated that the IRS advised him they do not send \u201chardship\u201d letters. He \nadmitted that he has failed to pay his taxes since 2001. He also admitted that he did not \nfile his income taxes for 2007 and 2006 and could not remember if there were other \nyears he failed to file.1 He believed he did not owe each year and was entitled to a \nrefund some years, but could not specifically identify which years. He stated he filed for \n2005 and believed he owed money, but did not pay it. His excuse for not paying was \nthat he did not have the money. He believed he did not owe taxes for certain years. He \nstated he claims eight exemptions on his taxes. He does not own a house and has two \nchildren. Applicant did not provide any evidence to support his position. He does not \nhave an installment plan to pay his taxes. He provided no documentary evidence at all \nfrom the IRS.2 \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which was for a credit card \nthat he defaulted on sometime in 1999 or 2000, when he was unemployed for a period \nof time. The amount owed is $1,130. He admitted he knew he stopped paying on the \ncard. He stated he had spoken to the creditors at the time he stopped paying and \nreceived letters from them back in 1999 or 2000. He has been aware of this delinquent \n \n1 Tr. 28-37, 68-71, 92-101; GE 14, 15, 16. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his income taxes was not \nalleged in the SOR. It will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but will be considered when \nanalyzing the whole person and his credibility. \n \n2 Tr. 28-37, 58, 68-71, 92-101, 140-142. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ndebt since then. He was offered settlement agreements, but could meet the terms. He \nhas not made any payments to resolve the debt.3 \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which is a delinquency on a \ncredit card in the amount of $1,660. He admitted he stopped paying on the debt \nsometime around 2000. He acknowledged he received statements from the creditor and \nwas aware he owed the debt. He has not made any payments to resolve the debt.4 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d is for a debt in the approximate amount \nof $1,061. The debt was for a credit card that Applicant stopped paying on in 2000. The \ncreditor got a judgment against Applicant. Applicant began making payments on the \njudgment. Applicant provided a copy of a motion to dismiss the case based on the \nfollowing statement: \u201cpaid, settled, and satisfied.\u201d5 The motion is dated August 12, 2008, \nand the case was dismissed on August 18, 2008.6 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b61.e is for child support that was placed for collection in the \namount of $1,639. Applicant stated he did not owe this debt. He stated he did not \ndispute it with the credit bureau, but he did dispute it with the child support division of \nthe state. He stated he had receipts to prove he does not owe this debt. He stated that \nhe went to court in March 2005 and was told by the judge he could pay his child support \nin cash. Applicant provided a copy of a court order for child support. Presumably this \ncourt order is for his younger child. He also provided receipts for payments of $299 for \nMarch 2006 through December 2006.7 It is clear Applicant paid child support for one of \nhis children during these months. It is unclear which child the arrearage is for and \nwhether Applicant satisfied the alleged arrearage. He was unemployed for a period and \nadmitted he got behind in his payments for the older child. He did not provide any \ndocumentation from the state\u2019s child support division to show he has satisfied the \nbalance owed. He did provide proof that he paid his child support for one daughter \nduring the months March through December 2006.8 \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owes the debt listed in SOR \u00b61.h. He entered into an \nagreement in September 2007 with the creditor to pay a total of $5,073.23. He is \nrequired to make $200 monthly payments, which began in October 2007. He provided \nreceipts for eight $200 payments. He stated he has been making payments each \n \n3 Tr. 37-43. \n \n4 Tr. 43-46. \n \n5 Tr. 46-53; AE A. He also provided three receipts in his Answer to the SOR that show payments \nof $200 to the same creditor. \n \n6 AE G. \n \n7 AE F. \n \n8 Tr. 29-30, 53-57, 102-115, 127-134. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nmonth.9 This debt was for a loan that Applicant took out in 2000 and stopped paying in \n2004. The reason he stopped paying was because the interest rate was too high. He \nacknowledged he was aware of the debt and that he knew it was delinquent and he \nowed it. Applicant believes this is the same debt as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but failed to \nprovide documentation to substantiate his position. The credit report lists the two debts \nwith different account numbers.10 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he owed the medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g. It \nwas placed for collection in August 2005. He paid the debt on August 11, 2008.11 He \nstated he believed his insurance was to pay it and he was unaware of it.  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt to the video store listed in SOR \u00b61.i is in the amount of \n$311. Applicant stated his car was stolen on March 1, 2002, and he reported it to the \npolice. He filed a supplemental report on March 2, 2002. The report reads: \u201cThe victim \n[Applicant] telephoned District IV and advised this officer that he forgot to mention that \nhis Federal Officer ID and Badge were inside his vehicle when it was stolen.\u201d12 \nApplicant stated at his hearing that his wallet was stolen from the vehicle and someone \nused his video store card and incurred the debt. He never contacted the creditor at the \ntime or the credit bureau to dispute the debt. He stated his car and wallet were \nrecovered, but he believed someone used his video card.13 I did not find his testimony \ncredible, with regard to someone misusing his video card.  \n \n \nApplicant signed a security clearance application (SCA) on August 25, 2006. In \nresponse to questions whether he had debts that were more than 180 delinquent or that \nwere currently over 90 days delinquent, he responded \u201cno.\u201d At his hearing he stated that \nat the time he filled out his SCA he did not know he had delinquent debts.14 He \nconcurred he had signed and certified his answers were true. He further explained that \nhe did not list his delinquent debts because he did not have the correct dates and years \nand he did not have all of the information at the time. He also stated that he needed to \nfill out the SCA to get a Top Secret Clearance so he could get a better job. I find \nApplicant deliberately and intentionally failed to list his delinquent debts. I find \nApplicant\u2019s explanations were not credible. He testified that he stopped paying on many \nof his debts because he was unemployed for a period of time, but never resumed \n \n9 AE D and I. \n \n10 Tr. 29, 56-66, 72; GE 3 and 4. \n \n11 Tr. 73-74; AE B. \n \n12 AE C. \n \n13 Tr. 74-81. \n \n14 Tr. 83-85. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \npaying. On most of the debts he received notices from the creditors regarding his \ndelinquency. He also had earlier testified to being aware of his debts.15 \n \n \nApplicant lives with his mother and pays her approximately $300 a month for \nrent, but sometimes it is less, depending on what he can afford. He owes his mother \n$5,000 for a car and pays approximately $200-$300 a month on this debt. He pays $800 \na month in child support for his 4-year-old daughter and $400 for his 14-year-old \ndaughter.16 \n \n \nApplicant stated he was unemployed for approximately 8-9 months in 1996 and \n1997, again from November 2000 to January 2001, and from August 2006 to December \n2006. He stated his mother paid his child support when he was unemployed.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n15 Tr. 82-101; GE 1 and 8. \n \n16 Tr. 102-103, 115-126. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Appellant had \ndelinquent debts that he was aware of since he stopped paying them as far back as \n1999 and 2000. Many of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved and others he \nwaited years to address. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising form financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 20 (a) (\u201cThe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death , divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u2018the person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d); and (e) (\u201cthe individual has a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d). \n \n \nApplicant has many debts that have been delinquent for years that remain \nunpaid. He has not paid his taxes for several tax years, including 2006 and 2007. He \nowes the IRS money, but has no plan on how to pay the federal government his taxes. I \nfind (a) does not apply. Applicant experienced periods of unemployment that impacted \nhis ability to pay his bills. Unfortunately, once Applicant was working again, he did not \ndo anything to contact his creditors and resume payment on his delinquent debts. \nInstead he let many of them remain dormant for years. He lives at home, pays minimal \nrent and expenses, yet failed to resolve his delinquent debts. He did not take action on \none debt until a judgment was entered against him. He has since paid that debt. He has \nan agreement with one creditor to pay $200 a month, but he only provided proof of eight \npayments when there should be eleven. I find (b) does not apply. Applicant did not \npresent any evidence that he has received counseling for the problem, nor are there \nclear indications that the problem is under control or being resolved. He did not make a \ngood-faith effort to repay his creditors. Most of his debts remain unpaid and he has not \ncontacted the creditors to resolve them for many years. It appears Applicant has paid \nchild support for his two daughters, but the documents he provided did not clear up the \namount that was in arrears and placed for collection. I find (c) and (d) do not apply. \n \n \nApplicant testified that his tax debt was somehow a \u201chardship\u201d debt. He provided \nno evidence to show that he did not have to pay this debt or it was somehow forgiven. \nHe did not provide any evidence to show he had set up an installment play to pay the \ndebt or that payment was deferred for a period of time. He did testify that for the past \nseven to eight years he failed to pay his taxes during some of those years, but he was \nnot sure which ones. He takes eight exemptions on his taxes when he does file. He did \nnot provide any documented proof to substantiate his dispute or \u201cagreement\u201d with the \nIRS. He failed to provide any other documented evidence to substantiate other disputes \nhe has with creditors. He disputes the video store debt, but failed to provide \ndocumented proof that he did so with the creditor or credit bureau. Although he filed a \npolice report that his car and his federal ID were stolen, it did not include his wallet. I \nfind (e) does not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. Conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d). I have considered all of the facts \nand find Applicant deliberately omitted and concealed his delinquent debts on his \nsecurity clearance application. Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible or believable. He \nclearly was aware that he stopped paying his debts when he was unemployed for a \nperiod of time and never resumed. At first he claimed he did not know about the debts \nand then he said the reason he did not list his delinquencies was because he did not \nhave the correct dates or years. He was aware he stopped paying on credit cards in \n1999 and 2000 and on a loan in 2004 because as he testified the interest rates were too \nhigh. I find (a) applies. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under personal conduct. I have considered all of them and \nespecially considered AG \u00b617 (a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts\u201d) and (c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d). Applicant concealed his delinquent debts by failing to list them on his SCA. \nHe filled it out in 2006 and did not make an attempt to correct it. He testified at his \nhearing that he was aware of his debts. Failing to divulge information that is pertinent to \na security clearance determination is a serious issue. It is not a minor offense, but goes \nto the crux of good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s testimony and \nexplanations were not believable. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has numerous debts that \nhave been delinquent for years. Although he had periods of unemployment, once he \n\n \n9 \n \n \nresumed working he did not attempt to resolve the delinquent debts. A three-year-old \nmedical debt was not paid until a few weeks before his hearing. One debt he has a \npayment plan for, but it was set up years after the debt was due, and he has missed \nsome payments. Another debt was finally paid, but it appears it was only after the threat \nof legal action. Applicant is irresponsible in his obligations to pay his taxes. It is clear \nApplicant was concerned about his chances of obtaining a Top Secret clearance so he \ncould get a better job and deliberately failed to list his financial delinquencies, which he \nwas aware of at the time. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 21, 2008 and December 16, 2008, and \nelected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February \n19, 2009, she changed her request to a hearing before an administrative judge. The \ncase was assigned to another administrative judge on March 4, 2009, and reassigned to \nme on March 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 16, 2009, and the \nApril 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing was convened as scheduled on April 9, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own \nbehalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through O, which were received without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 17, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is the \nadministrative assistant to the commanding officer of a military command. She has \nworked for her current employer or another contractor since May 2007. She is applying \nfor her first security clearance. She has a Bachelor of Science degree awarded in 2006. \nShe was married from 1991 until her divorce in 1998. She married again in 2004. She \nhas four children and two stepchildren. Three of her children are adults and one is a \nminor who lives with Applicant and her husband. The stepchildren live with their \nmother.1  \n \n \nApplicant started having financial problems after her divorce. She was a single \nparent with four children. She was self-employed as a cosmetologist and was not \nearning a large income. She attended college in hopes of making a better life for her \nand her children. She married in 2004, and her financial situation brightened for a \nperiod. Her husband then became unemployed in about 2006, and was out of work for \nabout a year.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts, including that she was behind on her \nmortgage and car loan. There is also an allegation that she was not paying her \ndelinquent debts despite having the income to do so. In her Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denied the general allegation that she was not paying her delinquent debts. \nShe admitted to all the specific debts, with explanations and additional information, \nexcept she denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k as a duplicate of the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. After considering all the evidence, I conclude that Applicant is correct that \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate of the debt which is correctly alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. Of the remaining debts, Applicant has brought her mortgage and car loan \ncurrent; she has paid five debts; and she is working on payment plans or arrangements \nfor the remaining three debts. Individual debts are addressed below. \n \n \nApplicant submitted documented proof that she paid the five delinquent debts \ntotaling $1,501, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.j. She also paid a \ndelinquent debt of $501 in April 2006. This debt was not listed on the SOR because it \nwas paid before the SOR was issued.3     \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 25-30; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 20-24, 45, 52-53. \n \n3 Tr. at 31-32, 35, 46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, D, E, F, J.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a debt of $25,610. This is Applicant\u2019s car loan. The basis of \nthis allegation is a credit report from June 29, 2007, that reported the debt as 60 days \npast due. The total balance on the loan at that time was $25,610. Applicant \nacknowledges that she was late on several payments. The creditor granted her several \nextensions, and the loan is now current. The current balance of the loan is $21,658. Her \nmonthly payments are $576 and the loan is scheduled to be paid in November 2012.4    \n \n \nApplicant admitted that she was behind on her mortgage payments, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. The June 29, 2007 credit report indicated that she had previously been past \ndue 60 days, but at that time was 30 days, or $889, past due. The credit report of June \n19, 2008 did not list the mortgage as past due. Applicant admitted that she was past \ndue on her mortgage a few years back. The mortgage company permitted her to catch \nup by paying an additional amount each month. Her mortgage is now current.5    \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a medical debt of $903. Applicant admitted to owing this debt. \nTwo of the debts that she paid have been collected by the same collection company \nseeking payment of this debt. She has paid $50 to the creditor and has maintained \ncontact with the collection company throughout the process. She intends to pay or settle \nthe debt.6    \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the delinquent debt of $4,420 to a collection \ncompany, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. This debt resulted from the deficiency owed on a car \nloan after the car was voluntarily repossessed. Applicant negotiated a payment plan \nwith the collection company in July 2008, in which she would pay $50 per month starting \nin August 2008. She made the first $50 payment. The collection company that Applicant \narranged the payment plan with is the second collection company to hold the debt after \nit was transferred from the original lender. Applicant then had contact with still another \ncollection company stating that it owned the debt. She stopped making payments \nbecause she wanted to verify exactly who owned the debt. She will resume payments \nonce it is ascertained who owns the debt. She plans to negotiate a lump sum settlement \nin the future.7  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a delinquent debt of $2,908 to a collection company on behalf \nof a jewelry company. Applicant acknowledged responsibility for this debt. She \nnegotiated a settlement with the collection company in August 2008, in which she would \npay $50 in August 2008, followed by three monthly payments of $492. She made the \nfirst payment of $50, but not the subsequent payments. She believed that she could \nmake the payments using funds she would earn in her second job as a real estate \nagent. She has not sold a house since then and has not earned the commission that \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 32-33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE B, C, M, O. \n \n5 Tr. at 44-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4; AE I, N. \n \n6 Tr. at 33-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4. \n \n7 Tr. at 36-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nshe was hoping to use for the settlement. She has maintained contact with the \ncollection company and intends to pay or settle the debt.8    \n \n \nApplicant retained the services of a professional in 2006, to assist in cleaning her \ncredit report. It involved minimal financial counseling. She was not receiving much value \nfrom the professional and decided to address her finances on her own. Her financial \nsituation is now in much better shape. Her husband is working and she has been \nsteadily employed for almost two years.9  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 42-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE H. \n \n9 Tr. at 53-55. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay her obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes three of the debts alleged in the SOR. She is in the process \nof resolving her financial issues, but has not yet completed the task. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable at this time. After her divorce in 1998, she was a single mother with four \nchildren, struggling to get by on her earnings as a cosmetologist. She married again in \n2004, and things were better until her husband lost his job and was unemployed for \nabout a year. These qualify as conditions that were outside her control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant went to school and earned a degree. She obtained a good job. \nShe started addressing her delinquent debts before they became an issue for her \nsecurity clearance. She paid six delinquent debts, one of which was not listed on the \nSOR because it was paid in 2006. She brought her mortgage and car loan current. She \nstill has three debts to be addressed. She candidly and credibly discussed the debts \nand her intentions to pay all her delinquent debts. I find that she has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable. She received minimal financial \ncounseling, but there are clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control. She has made a good-faith effort to repay her overdue creditors. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. \n \n \nApplicant established that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k is a duplicate of the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the SOR \u00b6 1.k debt. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant \nstruggled financially as a single mother of four children. She remarried and things were \nbetter until her husband became unemployed for about a year. She earned a degree \nand obtained a good job. He is back to work. As a result, her income improved, enabling \nher to address her debt issues. She has taken positive action on her debts. She paid six \ndebts; brought her mortgage and car loan current; and fully intends to satisfy the last \nthree remaining delinquent debts.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has noted that an applicant is not required to establish that \nshe has paid every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant must \ndemonstrate that she has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve [her] financial problems and \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d10 Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect. \nShe has paid a number of her debts, some alleged in the SOR and one not, but still has \ndebts to pay. However, she credibly testified that she intends to pay her delinquent \ndebts. I find that she has established a plan to resolve her financial problems and has \ntaken significant action to implement that plan.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n                                                          \n10 ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

The 2000 SF 86 will be \nconsidered in analyzing Applicant\u2019s 2006 SF 86; in the application of mitigating conditions; and in \nevaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n3 Items 2, 5-8. \n \n4 Items 2, 5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn about the fall of 2004, Applicant was drinking at a bar. He became intoxicated, \nwent outside, and fell asleep on the sidewalk or street. The local police called his \nmother who came and got him and drove him home. He was not charged for the \nincident. He told the OPM investigator in 2007, that he did not have a drinking problem. \nHe stated that from 2003 to 2004, he drank on the weekends, and to the point of \nintoxication about once a month. He described drinking to intoxication as consuming \nabout ten to twelve beers. He stated that since 2004, he only drank about one to two \nbeers, twice a month, and he stopped drinking to the point of intoxication. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he wrote that he no longer uses alcohol in any way.5  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions, certified as \ntrue on February 26, 2006. The introduction to Section 23 stated: \n \nFor this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your \ncase has been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the court record. The \nsingle exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the \nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an \nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. \n3607. \n \nQuestion 23d of the SF 86 asked, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of \nany offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d Question 23f asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you been arrested  for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in \nresponse to a, b, c, d, or e above (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the \nviolation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions.6 \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in July 2007. A signed \nstatement was not provided but the interview was memorialized in a report of \ninvestigation (ROI). DOHA sent Applicant a copy of the ROI in an interrogatory and \nasked him if the ROI reflected accurately the information he provided to the investigator \non the day he was interviewed. He was provided the opportunity to explain why the ROI \nwas inaccurate and to add additional information regarding the matters discussed \nduring the interview. He answered that the ROI was accurate. He did not submit \nadditional information. The ROI indicates that he did not list the open container in public \ncitation because he forgot about the citation when he completed the SF 86. Regarding \nthe drug-related offenses, the ROI stated: \n \nAfter pleading guilty, subject\u2019s attorney told him that he did not have to \ndisclose this arrest on employment paperwork since it was a suspended \nsentence. While completing his paperwork for his security clearance \napplication, subject debated if he should answer the question pertaining to \ndrug related arrest[s] and decided to willfully withhold the fact that he had \n                                                          \n5 Items 2, 5. \n \n6 Item 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nbeen arrested. Subject stated that he did deliberately falsif[y] his security \nclearance paperwork relating to his drug related arrest.7 \n \nApplicant denied the two falsification allegations in his response to the SOR. He \nwrote that he \u201cdid not fully understand the question and was mistaken in [his] omission \nof information.\u201d After considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant intentionally \nfalsified his Questionnaire for National Security Positions by not listing his open \ncontainer in public citation and his drug-related arrest under Questions 23d and 23f.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a number of letters from his supervisors and military \nmembers at commands that he supports. He is regarded as an outstanding employee \nand a valuable asset to the U.S. military. He is described as trustworthy, hard working, \ndependable, professional, and honest. He is recommended for a security clearance.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n                                                          \n7 Item 5. \n \n8 Item 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nIt is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, \nfictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the executive \nbranch of the Government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances \nare within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United \nStates.9 A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious offense as it may be punished by \nimprisonment for up to five years. Applicant knowingly and willfully made a materially \nfalse statement on his SF 86, as discussed above. He also smoked marijuana; was \ncited for having an open container in public; and was arrested for possession of a \n                                                          \n9 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). \n \n\n \n6 \n \ncontrolled substance and possession of controlled substance paraphernalia. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nApplicant was never criminally charged with DWI or when he was drunk and fell \nasleep in public. There is insufficient evidence to support the application of a \ndisqualifying condition for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1 d. Those allegations are concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana in 1997, when he was 16 years old. AG \u00b6 32(a) is \napplicable to that one-time drug use. A pipe with trace amounts of marijuana was \ndiscovered in his car in 2003. He stated that the pipe must have been left by a friend \nwithout his knowledge. He was never convicted of the offense. AG \u00b6 32(c) is applicable \nto the possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia offenses. He was cited for having an \nopen container in public in 2004. There have been no other alcohol-related offenses in \nthe last five years. AG \u00b6 32(a) is applicable to that citation. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false information on his SF 86 in 2006, which \nconstituted a federal crime. He was not honest in his response to the SOR when he \nstated that he did not intentionally falsify the SF 86 because he did not fully understand \nthe questions. No mitigating conditions are applicable to his violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1001. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \n\n \n7 \n \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant admitted to smoking marijuana in 1997. The police discovered a pipe \nthat contained marijuana residue in his car in 2003. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \napplicable as disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted to smoking marijuana on one occasion in 1997, when he was \nabout 16 years old. He stated the pipe was left in his car by a friend without his \nknowledge. There is no evidence of any drug involvement since 2003. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and \n(b) are applicable. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \n\n \n8 \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant has four alcohol-related incidents, including two that did not result in an \nalcohol-related arrest. He admitted to excessive drinking on two occasions resulting in \nhim passing out or falling asleep in his car and on the street. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c) are \napplicable.  \n \nTwo Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \n \nApplicant has not had an alcohol-related incident in almost five years. He stated \nthat he no longer drinks alcohol. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are applicable.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n9 \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 in 2006. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. His \ncriminal conduct, drug use, and alcohol-related incidents establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(e) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n10 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant stated at one point that his attorney told him that he did not have to \ndisclose his drug arrest on employment paperwork since it was a suspended sentence. \nHe also admitted to the OPM investigator that he debated whether to answer the \nquestion pertaining to drug arrest and decided to willfully withhold the fact that he had \nbeen arrested. He was provided the ROI in an interrogatory and stated that the ROI was \naccurate and that he had nothing further to add. He provided a contradictory answer in \nresponse to the SOR. I find no mitigating conditions are applicable to the intentional \nfalsification of his SF 86. I further find that the other criminal conduct, drug use, and \nalcohol-related incidents are mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 16(f) under the same \nrationale addressed under their specific guidelines.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 27 years old. I \nconsidered his honorable service in the U.S. Navy and his very favorable character \nletters and job performance. However, he was dishonest on his SF 86 and in his \nresponse to the SOR. His drug use, arrests, and alcohol-related incidents have been \n\n \n11 \n \nmitigated by the passage of time. His inability to provide truthful answers has not been \nmitigated and raises serious concerns about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Drug Involvement and Alcohol Consumption security \nconcerns, but has not mitigated the concerns arising under the Criminal Conduct and \nPersonal Conduct guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR and amended SOR. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 20 years old and graduated from high school in 2006. He attended a vocational/trade school as part of high school and has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2006. Applicant began drinking alcohol when he was 17 years old. On one occasion he blacked out from drinking too much alcohol.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nJ, G and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 21, 2008, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Department Counsel amended the SOR on August \n4, 2008. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s amended SOR and file of \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nrelevant material (FORM) on August 6, 2008.1 The FORM was received on August 12, \n2008. On August 24, 2008, Applicant responded to the amended SOR and admitted the \namended allegations.2 He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM \nand did not submit additional information. The case was assigned to me on October 7, \n2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR and amended SOR. In addition, \nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 20 years old and graduated from high school in 2006. He attended a \nvocational/trade school as part of high school and has been employed by a federal \ncontractor since November 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was 17 years old. On one occasion he \nblacked out from drinking too much alcohol. In October 2006 Applicant was arrested for \nDriving Under the Influence (DUI) of alcohol and Felony Maiming Resulting from DUI.  \nHis blood alcohol content at the scene of the accident was .12% and at the hospital was \n.14%. He was driving his car and rear ended another vehicle. A person in the other \nvehicle was injured and hospitalized for two days. On November 16, 2006, Applicant \nwas found guilty of DUI and the felony maiming charge was dismissed. He was \nsentenced to 30 days in jail, with 25 days suspended, fined approximately $450 in court \ncosts and fees, ordered to complete an alcohol safety program, and awarded probation \nfor a year. In addition, his driving privileges were suspended for one year. He completed \nthe court requirements of his sentence.  \n \n \nOn June 4, 2007, Applicant was charged with a misdemeanor for Unlawful \nPurchase/Underage Possession of Alcohol. He was found guilty and sentenced to 30 \ndays in jail, which was suspended, fined approximately $566 including court costs, and \nhis drivers license was suspended for an additional six months. Applicant was a \npassenger in a vehicle. He drank about three to four beers. When the car was pulled \nover the police officer opened the door of the vehicle and a 40 ounce beer fell out of the \ncar.  \n \n \n1 The amendments are as follows: \u201cA. to reflect the correct date of Applicant\u2019s convictions for \nunderage possession of alcohol in subparagraph 1.c. to wit: June 4, 2007 (vice May 7, 2007).\u201d Applicant \nagreed with the change. \u201cAmendment B. \u201cAdd the following allegation under new Paragraph 3, Guideline \nG: 3.: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Available \ninformation raising this concern shows that: a. That information set forth under paragraph 1, above. B. \nWhen you were 17 years old you drank too much beer at a party and blacked out.\u201d \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to the amended allegations was dated but was not signed. The \namendments were individually admitted and were initialed.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant does not believe he has a drinking problem. In his interview in August \n2007 with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator it stated he had not \nhad any alcohol to drink since November 2006. This statement is inconsistent with the \nOPM investigation where it states he consumed three to four beers when he was \nstopped and charged with underage possession of alcohol.3 Applicant did not provide \nany amplifying information in mitigation. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n \n3 Item 5 reflects Applicant\u2019s confirmation that the OPM investigation is accurate and correct. He \nmade a statement correcting the information that his DUI was a misdemeanor and no a felony. He did not \nmake any other changes.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct: ACriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.@ \n \nI have considered all of the criminal conduct disqualifying conditions and \nespecially considered AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) \nand AG & 31(c) (an allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). Applicant was \nconvicted of a DUI and several months later was convicted of underage possession of \nalcohol. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the criminal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment\u201d) and (d) (\u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d). \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was 17. He had been drinking alcohol when \nhe was involved in an accident in 2006, in which he and another person were injured. \nHe pled guilty to DUI and was sentenced. Approximately eight months later he was \ncharged and convicted of underage possession of alcohol. In his interview with an OPM \ninvestigator he stated he had not had any alcohol since his DUI incident. This is \ninconsistent with another part of the investigation that reflects he had consumed three to \nfour beers when he was charged with underage possession of alcohol. It has been \napproximately 23 months since his DUI conviction and 16 months since his \nmisdemeanor conviction for underage possession of alcohol. Applicant did not offer \nsufficient information to mitigate the security concerns raised by his illegal actions. \nApplicant has demonstrated a continuing course of conduct as it relates to alcohol and \nabiding by the law. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \nI have considered all of the alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 22 and especially considered (a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such \nas driving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d). Applicant had two alcohol-related incidents in a \nshort span of time. One is a DUI conviction and the other is a misdemeanor conviction \nfor underage possession of alcohol. He also admitted he blacked out from drinking \nalcohol when he was 17. Applicant does not believe he has a problem with alcohol. I \nfind (a) applies to the facts.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23. I especially considered (a) (\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d). I do not have any other information as to Applicant\u2019s actions regarding his \nalcohol related incidents. His OPM statement reflects that he had not consumed alcohol \nsince his DUI convictions. He has a misdemeanor conviction for underage possession \nand the police office who stopped observed Applicant\u2019s eyes and he appeared to have \nbeen drinking. He has not offered any amplifying information about this discrepancy, or \nsufficient information to mitigate the alcohol consumption concerns. I have considered \nthe above mitigating condition as it relates to the alcohol issues raised. There was a \nrelatively short period of time between Applicant\u2019s DUI conviction and his underage \npossession conviction. No evidence was presented to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s alcohol use. Under the circumstances of this case I find no \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nI have considered the personal conduct security concerns. I find, based on the \nfacts, AG \u00b6 16 (e) (\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group\u201d) applies. Almost every aspect of a person\u2019s life can be evaluated \ngenerally as a security concern under Personal Conduct. I have considered all of the \nfacts in this case from that Personal Conduct perspective. I find Applicant\u2019s conduct \nfrom a whole person analysis does raise questions as to his judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness, which could be exploited. Applicant did not provide sufficient \ninformation to consider in mitigation.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 20-year-old young \nman who already has two alcohol-related convictions. He received a DUI conviction and \nshortly thereafter another conviction for underage possession of alcohol. He did not \noffer any evidence in mitigation. His second conviction occurred months after his DUI \nconviction, which is a cause for concern. Without substantive information the security \nconcerns remain. Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \ncriminal conduct, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She is a 39-year-old\nundergraduate teaching assistant employed by a defense contractor since January\n2005. She seeks to retain the interim clearance she held until the SOR was issued.\nApplicant was born in the U.S. in February 1979, to Iranian nationals residing in\nthe U.S. while her father attended school. She obtained U.S. citizenship by birth and\nderived Iranian citizenship through her parents. In 1980 or 1981, she returned to Iran\nwith her parents, and resided continuously there until April 1999.\nApplicant was raised and educated in Iran. However, her goal was always to\nreturn to the U.S. to live. When she war four or five years old, she understood that she\nwas a U.S. citizen and could move here as soon as she was able. She began studying\nEnglish so her English could be as good as possible when that day arrived. She had\nhoped to persuade her parents to let her return to the U.S. to attend high school and\ncollege, but was unable to do so. She completed two years of college in Iran before she\nconvinced them that she was old enough to live on her own in the U.S. When she\nreturned to the U.S., she began taking computer courses at a local community college,\nultimately obtaining her associate\u2019s degree in computer science. In February 2007, she\nobtained her undergraduate degree in computer science. She worked to fund her\neducation.\nWhen Applicant returned to the U.S., she exited Iran on the Iranian passport\nrequired for her to leave the country. She used that passport once to enter Iran\u2014in\nJune 2001\u2014when she traveled to visit her parents. That passport expired in September\n2003. Applicant shredded her Iranian passport in her personal shredder when she\napplied for her clearance. She keeps her U.S. passport current. She does not intend to\nreturn to Iran.\nApplicant has been married for a year to a native-born U.S. citizen. They jointly\nown their home, valued at $350,000. They plan to live in the U.S. and raise their family\nhere. Applicant volunteers her time in the local community, and serves on the diversity\ncouncil at work. She has a retirement account with her employer.\nAlthough her parents are resident citizens of Iran, they are also legal permanent\nresidents (LPR) of the U.S. They visit Applicant in the U.S. every year. They are saving\nto be able to move to the U.S. without having to rely on Applicant or public assistance\nfor support. Her father is a civil engineer for a private company; her mother is a self-\nemployed counselor for teenagers. Applicant\u2019s brother is also a resident citizen of Iran,\nwhom Applicant has sponsored for his visa to immigrate to the U.S. He is a public\nrelations manager for a private firm. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have any\nconnection to the Iranian government. Applicant has no financial interests in Iran. She\nhas disavowed any inheritance she might receive from her parents, so her brother will\ninherit their estate.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s coworkers and character references consider her honest and\ntrustworthy. During the time she had an interim clearance, she demonstrated that she\ncan handle classified information appropriately.\nIran is a fundamentalist Islamic republic with a poor human rights record. Its\nrelations with the U.S. are confrontational and unlikely to improve given Iran\u2019s efforts to\nacquire nuclear weapons, its sponsorship of, support for, and involvement in,\ninternational terrorism, and its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace\nprocess. Nevertheless, Iran is not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive\neconomic information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation. \nTravel to Iran remains problematic. The Department of State\u2019s May 2007 Travel\nWarning continues to warn U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to Iran,\nnoting that dual national Iranian-American citizens may encounter difficulty in departing\nIran. Some elements of the Iranian government and population remain hostile to the\nU.S. Consequently, American citizens may be subject to harassment or arrest while\ntraveling or residing in Iran. Americans of Iranian origin are urged to consider the risk of\nbeing targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. In addition, Iranian\nauthorities may deny dual nationals access to the U.S. Interests Section in Tehran,\nbecause they are considered to be solely Iranian citizens. Large-scale demonstrations\nhave taken place in various regions throughout Iran over the past several years as a\nresult of a sometimes volatile political climate. U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite\nthe travel warning are urged to exercise caution.\nThe U.S. government does not currently have diplomatic or consular relations\nwith the Islamic Republic of Iran, and, therefore, cannot provide protection or routine\nconsular services to American citizens in Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its\nEmbassy in Tehran, serves as protecting power for U.S. interests in Iran. Neither U.S.\npassports nor visas to the United States are issued in Tehran. The Iranian government\ndoes not recognize dual citizenship and generally does not permit the Swiss to provide\nprotective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals. In addition, U.S.\ncitizens of Iranian origin who are considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens have been\ndetained and harassed by Iranian authorities.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n3\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Security\n4\nconcerns may also be raised if there are connections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(b).\n5\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(a).\n6\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(b).\n7\n5\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.5\nApplicant has frequent and close contact with her parents who are resident\ncitizens of Iran. However, they are also LPRs of the U.S., intending to immigrate to the\nU.S. as soon as they are financially able. Applicant is similarly close to her brother, who\nshe has sponsored for his U.S. immigration visa. Nevertheless, none of them is\nconnected in any way to the Iranian government. In addition, Applicant has not traveled\nto Iran in over seven years, and has no intent to do so in the future. She has shredded\nthe expired Iranian passport that would otherwise be required to enter Iran. Under\nGuideline B, the mere existence of a foreign family member is not sufficient. The nature\nof Applicant\u2019s contact with the family member must be examined to determine whether it\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative term denoting increased risk over some normally\nexisting risk that can be said to be inherent anytime a family member lives subject to a\nforeign government. One factor that heightens the risk in Applicant\u2019s case is the nature\nof the Iranian government and its hostility towards the United States.\nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s potential for foreign influence, I have considered the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of\nthe U.S.  I have also considered whether there is no conflict of interest, either because\n6\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government,\nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.7\nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign\nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the\nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d Thus, an administrative judge\ncould not apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk. Under the new\nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if\nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest.\nThe nature of the government of Iran, its disregard for human rights, and its\npursuit of nuclear weapons place a heavy burden on Applicant in mitigating the\ndisqualifying conditions and the security concerns. Countering that somewhat is the fact\nthat Iran is not a known collector of U.S. information. Applicant has close relationships\n\n6\nwith her parents and brother. However, given their lack of connection to the Iranian\ngovernment, it is highly unlikely that there could be a circumstance where Applicant is\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of her family and the\ngovernment of Iran or interests of the United States because of the nature of the Iranian\ngovernment. \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty is demonstrably to the U.S. She has little if any sense\nof loyalty to Iran. She was born in the U.S. and had a life-long goal of returning to her\nnative land. She contemplated leaving Iran as a teenager, and left Iran as soon as she\ncould convince her parents that she was old enough to manage being in the U.S. alone,\nbefore she finished college. She completed her education here, married and purchased\na home here, established roots here. She is actively pursuing bringing her brother here.\nHer sense of loyalty or obligation is not to Iran but to the United States. In a telling\nmoment in the hearing, Applicant acknowledged her understanding that \u201cwe don\u2019t have\nvery good relations with them.\u201d A conflict of interest in this case is extremely unlikely. In\nbalancing all of the factors mentioned and considered above, I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s\nloyalty to the United States is such that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the United States. Accordingly, Applicant has met her heavy burden\nto show that her contacts with her family in Iran do not cause a security concern. I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated security concerns rising from her contact with her\nfamily in Iran. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \n\nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s indebtedness began in approximately 2001 and continued\nuntil 2008.  Applicant had 16 debts totaling $55,582.  Applicant stated that his financial problems\nbegan when he invested in an unsuccessful pyramid scheme and when he incurred expenses to help\nout family members.  These events began a \u201cfinancial tailspin\u201d that did not end until Applicant filed\nfor bankruptcy in 2008.  An initial Chapter 13 bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 two months\nprior to the hearing.  Applicant failed to list two judgments and debts over 180 days delinquent\nduring the last seven years on a 2007 security clearance application.  He also failed to list debts\ncurrently over 90 days delinquent.  Applicant\u2019s pride got the better of him when he completed the\napplication and he was too embarrassed to put the information down.\nThe Judge concluded that while some mitigation was established owing to the fact that\nApplicant had to deal with a death in the family and received some mandatory counseling connected\nto the bankruptcy, not enough time had elapsed to show that his financial problems are resolved or\nunder control.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent, not isolated, and\npotentially a concern in the future.  The Judge also concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate\nhis admitted falsifications on his security clearance application.  \nApplicant argues that he produced sufficient evidence in mitigation, that the indebtedness\nwas a result of circumstances beyond his control, and that his omissions from the security clearance\napplication were the result of negligence.  He also stated that he was embarrassed about his debts.\nApplicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious because it does not take into\nconsideration the evidence presented.  Applicant\u2019s claims do not establish error on the part of the\nJudge.\nConcerning Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Judge failed to take into consideration record\nevidence, there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge has considered all the record evidence unless\nhe or she specifically indicates otherwise.  Applicant\u2019s brief sheds no light on precisely which\nportions of the record he believes the Judge failed to take into account.  Applicant has failed to rebut\nthe presumption.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments concerning mitigation do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of Guideline F mitigating conditions and\ncogently explained why there was insufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  He also discussed the inapplicability of Guideline E mitigating conditions.  His\n\nconclusions are reasonably supported by the record evidence. \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

On October 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct) for Applicant. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nSeptember 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response, which was \nreceived by DOHA on February 19, 2009, requesting a decision without a hearing. On \nMarch 19, 2009, Department Counsel requested the case be converted to a hearing \npursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural Guidance in enclosure (3) \nof DoD Directive 5220.6. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 22, \n2009. On April 29, 2009, the case was assigned to another administrative judge, and \non May 11, 2009, the case was reassigned to me due to caseload considerations. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 30, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May \n18, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through N, \nwhich were received without objection, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 3, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Applicant stated that he had retained an \nattorney to represent him at his hearing. Upon further questioning, I determined that \nthis attorney was the same attorney that he retained to represent him for his \nbankruptcy proceedings, discussed infra. I further noted, and Department Counsel \nconfirmed, that no attorney filed a notice of appearance to represent Applicant at his \nhearing. I ascertained that Applicant paid his bankruptcy attorney his fee, but did not \npay him a fee to represent him at his DOHA hearing.  \n \nI inquired whether Applicant desired additional time to ascertain his attorney\u2019s \nparticipation in these proceedings, which he declined. Applicant affirmatively stated \nthat he desired to go forward without an attorney present. I further inquired whether \nApplicant had received a copy of DOHA\u2019s Prehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial \nSecurity Clearance (ISCR) Hearings and Trustworthiness (ADP) Hearings. He \nindicated that he had, and that he would inform me whether he had any questions \nabout the proceedings. Tr. 5-15. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel stated that debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k. and 1.l.; and 1.c. \nand 1.o., are duplicates. He also added that the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i. is not \nincluded in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition, discussed infra. Tr. 23-24.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old security officer who has been employed by a \ngovernment contractor since June 1997. Tr. 39, GE 1. Applicant stated that he \ncurrently holds a top secret security clearance, which he was granted \u201csince 2000,\u201d \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand held an interim top secret security while on active duty in the Navy, discussed \ninfra. Maintaining a security clearance is a requirement of his continued employment. \nTr. 39-41. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1987. Tr. 36-37. He served in the \nNavy on active duty from August 1987 to August 1990, and was honorably discharged \nas a Hull Technician Third Class (pay grade E-4). Following his release from active \nduty, he was a drilling member of the Naval Reserve from September 1990 to May \n1999. Tr. 32-36, GE 1. Applicant attended a community college from November 1990 \nto August 1992, and estimates that that he has earned \u201c20 to 26 credits.\u201d Tr. 37-38, \nGE 1. \n \nApplicant has never married, but is involved in a long-term relationship with a \nwoman, who is the mother of their two pre-school age sons. Applicant has an informal \nchild support arrangement in which he pays the mother of his children \u201c[a]bout 1,500 \n(dollars) a month.\u201d His sons\u2019 mother is employed as a safety agent for a major \nmetropolitan school district. Tr. 30-32. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his January 2007 e-QIP; his February 1997 security clearance \napplication; his two June 2008 Responses to DOHA Interrogatories; his June 2008, \nMarch 2008, and January 2007 credit reports; his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings, and \nsubsequent Chapter 7 request for conversion. GE 1 \u2013 13. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 18 separate line items. However, as noted by \nDepartment Counsel, two debts are duplicates. Excluding those two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.l. and 1.o.), 16 separate debts remain totaling $55,582. As noted, Applicant admitted \nall debts. The remaining SOR debts consist of two judgments, eight charged off \naccounts, five collection accounts, and one delinquent account. \n \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness began in approximately 2001 and continued until \n2008. After determining that his finances were \u201cgetting out of control,\u201d he decided to \nfile bankruptcy. Tr. 58, 91-92. In August 2008, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. His accompanying summary of schedules lists total assets of $5,033 and \ntotal liabilities of $57,800. Unable to make his payments to the trustee, Applicant \nconverted his Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2009. Tr. 81-\n82, GE 8 - 3. Applicant testified that he was awarded a discharge on May 5, 2009; \nhowever, he did not provide any documentation supporting that claim. Tr. 9-11, 73-81. \nApplicant underwent mandatory financial counseling in conjunction with his bankruptcy \nfiling. GE 9. \n \nApplicant stated his financial problems began in approximately 2001 when he \ninvested $1,000 in an unsuccessful pyramid scheme and \u201ceverything went downhill\u201d \nfrom there. Tr. 46-48, 90. He also had \u201ccertain bills to help out [his] mother\u201d and other \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfamily members, and also contributed towards his grandfather\u2019s funeral expenses. He \nprovided this financial assistance in approximately 2001. Tr. 49-51. This was the \nbeginning of a financial tailspin that did not end until he filed for bankruptcy. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28.a. and 28.b. on his January 2007 e-\nQIP (asking whether in last seven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebts); and (asking whether he was currently over 90 days delinquents on any debts), \nrespectively. He failed to list any debts. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) \n \nHe also answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 27.d. on his January 2007 e-QIP (asking \nwhether in the last seven years he had any judgments against him that were not paid), \nand failed to disclose the two judgments filed against him by a credit union in the \namount of $20,432 and by a credit card company in the amount of $1,891, alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and 2.c.) \n \nHis explanation for failing to list his two judgments and debts over 180 days \ndelinquent during the last seven years and debts currently over 90 days delinquent \nwas: \n \nAs for when the questionnaires for my SF-86 came out, basically, \ntruthfully, to my knowledge, when the questions came out regarding my \ndelinquency and my financial statement, my pride took the better of me. I \nwas totally embarrassed to put the information down. And, I was saying \nto myself hopefully I could take care of it, and this matter could be \nresolved. My pride took the better of me in not putting that information \ndown. I was humiliated with the way my financial crisis turned about. It \nkind of set me back. Tr. 26. \n \nThis response is consistent with the response Applicant provided to an Office of \nPersonnel (OPM) investigator during his background investigation interview in \nFebruary 2007. Tr. 43, GE 4. \n \nRecommendations \n \nApplicant submitted 11 documents that included certificates of appreciation, \nletters of appreciation, and in-service training certificates. Of particular note, Applicant \nwas recognized for providing protective services to senior level U.S. and foreign \nleaders during his assignments. He was also consistently recognized for his \nprofessionalism and courtesy. AE A \u2013 K. Three supervisory personnel submitted \nreference letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They describe him as \u201cdiligent and capable,\u201d \n\u201c(his) dedication and perseverance are irreproachable and his maturity and judgment \nare impeccable,\u201d \u201csound integrity and judgment,\u201d \u201cone of [his team\u2019s] beloved \nmembers,\u201d and \u201c[one who] gives all of us a sense of security.\u201d AE L \u2013 N. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended \nand modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant \nconcerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, \n1995), Section 3. Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I \nhave based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \nas to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the \nburden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at \n531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers \nto DOHA interrogatories, his SOR response, and statement at his hearing. The \ngovernment established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through \n20(e) are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,1 I am only able to give Applicant \npartial credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) and conclude that none of the remaining \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant submitted evidence of having a death in the \nfamily around the time his financial difficulties began, and he participated in the \nmandatory counseling required during the bankruptcy process. However, the death in \nthe family was a number of years ago and Applicant is unable to demonstrate his \ncurrent financial situation is sufficiently attributable to that event. Furthermore, enough \ntime has not elapsed after his bankruptcy to demonstrate that financial counseling has \nresulted in showing his financial problems are resolved or are under control. To \nconclude, Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to raise full applicability of any \nof the mitigating conditions. \n \nApplicant has worked continuously for his current employer since 1997 and has \nearned income over those 12 years. Insufficient time has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy discharge to evaluate his track record of financial responsibility or that he \nhas taken control of his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his \nfinancial problems are recent, not isolated, and it is unclear whether they will be a \nconcern in the future. He has not carried his burden of proving his financial \nresponsibility. His overall financial behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are \nconsidered as a whole. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose any of his past indebtedness and judgments on his \nJanuary 2007 e-QIP. The government established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nevidence presented the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(c).2 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could potentially mitigate security \nconcerns about his personal conduct: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice \nof authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon \nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the \ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n2Deliberate and materially false answers on a security clearance application may violate 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 \n(1995); as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the \ndecision making body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, \n553 (3d Cir. 2004). If Applicant had provided accurate answers on his security clearance applications, \nhis accurate answers are capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance. His \nfailure to disclose financial problems are sufficiently serious to potentially jeopardize approval of his \nsecurity clearance. Making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the \nmaximum potential sentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 fine). In light of my \nultimate decision, and the absence of an allegation of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 in the SOR, it is \nunnecessary for me to decide whether or not Applicant actually violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. He does receive some credit for \ntruthfully disclosing his indebtedness and judgments when confronted by an OPM \ninvestigator. At his hearing, he also admitted his falsifications. He explained his failure \nto be completely truthful on his e-QIP was caused primarily by embarrassment.3 While \nhe did subsequently admit his falsifications, that does not take away from the fact at \nthe time he completed his e-QIP he was well aware of his unfavorable financial \nhistory. He knowingly and deliberately chose not to disclose full information about his \nunfavorable financial history on his security clearance application.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n3The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden \nof proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or \nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a \nJudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is \ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at \nthe time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to \nconclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June \n9, 2004)).  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nwhole person concept. Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility spanned a minimum of eight \nyears from 2001 to 2009. His deliberate falsifications, if relied upon, could have \nadversely affected or influenced the security clearance adjudication process to the \ndetriment of the government.  \n \nApplicant receives substantial credit for his three years of active duty and \nsubsequent service in the Naval Reserve, his responsibility to his family, and his \nrecent efforts to recover from his financial irresponsibility. His work for a government \ncontractor is excellent, and aside from the SOR allegations no other disciplinary or \nsecurity-related problems surfaced. His record of good employment weighs in his \nfavor. There is a definite dichotomy between how Applicant handled his financial \naffairs and his work-related performance. I am convinced that he is loyal to his family, \nhis company, and his country.   \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose information on his security clearance \napplication is serious, recent, and not mitigated. I have questions about his current \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.k.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.l.
