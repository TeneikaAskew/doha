He also used marijuana on a single occasion while he was in the Air\nForce, which resulted in disciplinary action being taken against him and his receipt of a\nGeneral Discharge. He has not used marijuana since 2003, and he now consumes alcohol\nresponsibly and in moderation. Applicant has mitigated the security concern that was\ncreated by his alcohol consumption and use of marijuana. Clearance is granted. \nOn June 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) and\nGuideline H (drug involvement). Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA\non July 24, 2009. Applicant admitted all allegations and requested a hearing. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 12, 2010\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on September 9, 2009. A notice of hearing was\nissued on October 8, 2009, scheduling the hearing for October 27, 2009. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted three documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3 and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified, called three witnesses to testify on his behalf, and he submitted a binder\ncontaining nine tabs that was marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1, and admitted into the\nrecord without objection. The transcript was received on November 12, 2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 28-year-old single man who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since March 2005. He was initially employed by the defense contractor as a field\nengineer. However, his stellar work performance led to his promotion to senior systems\nintegration engineer, a position normally requiring the occupant to have a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree, which Applicant does not possess.  \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1999. He worked as a clerk in a retail\nstore from May 1999, until he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in January 2001. Applicant\nserved on active duty in the Air Force until he was discharged with a General Discharge\nUnder Honorable Conditions in August 2004. The basis for his discharge was misconduct\ndue to drug abuse. Applicant held a couple of short term jobs following his discharge until\nhe obtained his current employment.  \nApplicant has deployed to combat areas with his current employer on three\noccasions: May 2005 to May 2006; May 2007 to August 2007; and May 2008 to August\n2008. His work responsibilities while deployed have frequently required him to travel by\nhelicopter and truck convoy to remote locations. As a result, Applicant has on multiple\ntimes been exposed to small arms, mortar, and rocket fire. His specific duties sometimes\nrequire him to place himself in positions that are exposed and particularly vulnerable to\nsmall arms fire.   \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors testified and submitted affidavits on his behalf. They\nconsider him to be an excellent worker and dedicated employee who is a valuable asset\nto his employer. He has earned their trust based on his reliability and integrity. They are\nall aware of his history of using marijuana and abusing alcohol, and they are satisfied  that\nhe has matured significantly and that there is no likelihood that such misconduct will recur.\nThey have also socialized with Applicant on occasion and consider his current use of\nalcohol to be responsible.\nApplicant held a security clearance when he was in the Air Force and during his\noverseas deployments with his current employer. While serving in combat areas, he had\ndaily access to highly classified information. There is no evidence to suggest that he ever\nmishandled or risked the compromise of classified information, and no prior adverse action\nhas been taken to revoke or downgrade his clearance. \n\n3\nApplicant first consumed alcohol when he was 16 years old and golfing with a friend.\nHe became intoxicated and he did not consume alcohol again until after he enlisted in the\nAir Force. After he completed Air Force basic training, Applicant found himself in a living\nenvironment where beer was readily available and frequently consumed by airmen.\nApplicant was 20 years old when he began drinking beer in the Air Force. His consumption\nincreased to the point where he was drinking as many as 18 cans of beer a day. Several\ntimes a month Applicant would drink beer before reporting for duty and he feels that he\nwas often alcohol-impaired when he reported for duty.\nApplicant moved out of a barracks and into a house that he shared with two other\nairmen in about 2003. Applicant\u2019s roommates used marijuana on a more or less regular\nbasis. During a party at the residence Applicant used marijuana while he was intoxicated.\nApplicant possessed a security clearance at the time he used the marijuana. He credibly\ntestified this was the only time in his life that he used marijuana. Sometime after the party,\nsomeone reported to Air Force officials that marijuana was used at the party. Applicant was\nquestioned by investigators and admitted that he had used marijuana. He was disciplined\nunder Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) by being reduced in rank\nand forfeiting pay. He was also processed for an administrative discharge and he was\nawarded a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions. The basis for the discharge\nwas misconduct due to drug abuse. \nApplicant became concerned about his excessive use of alcohol and he voluntarily\nenrolled in an Air Force alcohol and drug abuse program in February 2004. He attended\ndaily counseling sessions during the first two weeks of the program and once a month\nsessions for the remainder of the program. Applicant successfully completed the program\nin August 2004. Applicant also attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings during that time\nperiod. He remained alcohol abstinent while in the program but resumed using alcohol after\nhe completed the program. \nApplicant describes his current use of alcohol as that of a social drinker. He\nconsumes as much as four beers on weekends and wine on occasion. Applicant remained\nabstinent from alcohol, as required, when he was deployed overseas from May 2005 to\nMay 2006. As part of the current security clearance process, Applicant obtained a\nsubstance abuse evaluation in December 2008. The evaluation, performed by a licensed\nclinical social worker (LCSW) at a recognized substance abuse provider, concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s previous problem with alcohol was in full remission and that he did not need\ntreatment. \nApplicant submitted the testimony and report of a clinical psychologist at the\nhearing. The psychologist administered a battery of psychological tests, reviewed a number\nof reports, interviewed collateral witnesses, and conducted a clinical interview of Applicant.\nHe concluded that Applicant \u201cappears to be free of any significant psychological disorder,\nincluding any abuse of or dependence on alcohol and any use at all of non-legal drugs.\u201d\n(AE 1, Tab H, p. 8) The psychologist\u2019s diagnosis for Applicant was Alcohol Abuse in\nSustained Full Remission. (AE 1, Tab H, p. 8) He opined that Applicant\u2019s alcohol and drug\nabuse occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and he provided a favorable\nprognosis for Applicant as to both alcohol and drug abuse.    \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n4\nApplicant submitted a notarized statement in which he avers: 1) he has only used\nmarijuana once in his life; 2) he no longer associates with individuals who use marijuana;\n3) he does not intend to use marijuana in the future or associate with persons who use\nmarijuana; 4) he understands that if he uses marijuana in the future his security clearance\nwill automatically be revoked; and 5) he will submit to random drug testing.\n      \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision must be a fair\nand impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6\nof the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or\nagainst clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the\nevidence as a whole, Guideline G (alcohol consumption) and Guideline H (drug\ninvolvement) with their disqualifying and mitigating conditions are most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n5\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment\nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] \u00b6 21)  \nApplicant consumed alcohol to excess from 2001 until 2004, while he served in the\nAir Force. He frequently reported impaired for duty after consuming alcohol. He possessed\na security clearance during this time period. He eventually became concerned about his\nabuse of alcohol and he referred himself to an alcohol abuse program. A clinical\npsychologist provided a diagnosis for Applicant of Alcohol Abuse in Sustained Full\nRemission.  The following Disqualifying Conditions (DC) apply: DC 22(b): alcohol-related\nincidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition,\nor drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; DC 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; and DC 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or\nalcohol dependence.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol occurred over the course of a few years when he was\naway from home for the first time and serving with the Air Force in an environment where\nalcohol appears to have regularly been abused by the airmen with whom Applicant worked\nand resided. He recognized he had a problem with his abuse of alcohol and he referred\nhimself for treatment. He successfully completed the alcohol abuse program and he\nattended AA meetings. He currently uses alcohol in a mature and responsible manner that\nis consistent with a man of his age. \nApplicant remained abstinent from alcohol while he was in the treatment program\nin 2004, and again for the year he was deployed overseas in a combat area. He submitted\nan evaluation from a LCSW who is a staff member at a recognized substance abuse\nprovider that indicated Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse issues were in full remission. At the\nhearing, Applicant provided the testimony and the report of a clinical psychologist who,\nfollowing a thorough examination and evaluation, concluded Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse\nproblem was in full and sustained remission and was unlikely to recur.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s age at the time he abused alcohol, his employment history\nafter he was discharged from the Air Force, the testimony of Applicant\u2019s current\n\n6\nsupervisors, the evaluations of the LCSW and the psychologist, and Applicant\u2019s overall\ntestimony, appearance, and demeanor, I find the following Mitigating Conditions (MC)\napply: MC 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 23(b):\nthe individual acknowledges his . . .  issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions\ntaken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of . . . responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser); and MC 23(d): the individual has successfully completed inpatient or\noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated\na clear and established pattern on modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous\nor a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24\nApplicant used marijuana on one occasion while he was in the Air Force and in\npossession of a security clearance. DC 25(a): any drug abuse: DC 25(g): any illegal drug\nuse after being granted a security clearance apply.\nApplicant only used marijuana one time and then only after he had become\nintoxicated. It has been over six years since Applicant abused a controlled substance. He\nno longer associates with the people who were present at the party where he used\nmarijuana or with anyone else who abuses controlled substances. Applicant successfully\ncompleted an alcohol and drug abuse program after his one time use of marijuana and he\nsubmitted an evaluation performed by a clinical psychologist who opines that Applicant is\nunlikely to abuse alcohol or controlled substances in the future. Finally, Applicant has\nagreed to submit to random drug testing with the automatic revocation of his security\nclearance if he abuses a controlled substance in the future. \nThe following mitigating conditions apply: MC 26(a): the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; MC 26(b): a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation; and MC 26(d):\nsatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited\nto rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\n\n7\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded assessment of\na person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts and\nomissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all\nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis. Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the\nDirective, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has\nmitigated the security concern caused by his alcohol consumption and drug involvement.\nHe has overcome the case against him and satisfied his burden of persuasion. Guideline\nG and Guideline H are decided for Applicant. It is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a-c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a-c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes eight delinquent debts totaling $25,667 (SOR 1.a-1.h) (Item 1). Applicant indicated the $435 tax lien in SOR 1.a had been paid, and that the $389 telephone debt in SOR 1.c and the $1,600 debt in SOR 1.h were pending negotiations and would be \u201ccorrected\u201d by 2010. Applicant denied any responsibility for the other debts in the SOR and averred they had been cleared from his credit report (Item 3). After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old electrician, who worked for a defense contractor in a war zone in Southwest Asia from August 2004 to September 2005. He now works for a different company performing installations in various countries, including at consulates abroad. He requires a secret-level security clearance.3 I took judicial notice sua sponte of a map of the pertinent state. The municipality in which Applicant 4 maintains his residency is incorporated within the county that issued the lien reported on his credit report. It is unclear whether this is a different lien from that reported on his e-QIP. The county named on his e-QIP is 3 In May 2000, Applicant purchased his home by taking out a 30-year mortgage of $91,650, to be repaid at $1,036 per month (Item 3, 5).

As of July 2009, the credit reporting\nagencies were reporting a total of $2,424 in past due balances. Financial concerns are\nmitigated because of his efforts to correct his credit record and his intent to pay\nlegitimate balances. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on February 9, 2008. On June 25, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, that provided the basis\nfor its preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nMarch 31, 2010\n\nIn its correspondence forwarding the FORM to Applicant on August 12, 2009, DOHA indicated that\n1\nhe requested a determination without a hearing. The file for review does not contain a document from\nApplicant confirming that request. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on September 11, 2009, and\nhe did not object to proceeding without a hearing. In its FORM, the government took the position, consistent\nwith \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive, that since Applicant did not request a hearing, his case defaulted to an\nadministrative determination.\nIncluded in Item 2 of the FORM is a transmittal letter from DOHA to Applicant dated March 31, 2009,\n2\nreferencing an enclosed SOR and a receipt signed by Applicant on April 15, 2009. The SOR of record, which\nwas included in the FORM as Item 1, is dated June 25, 2009. Presumably, an earlier version of the SOR was\nforwarded to Applicant by the transmittal letter dated March 31, 2009. Item 7 of the FORM consists of an\nunsigned statement from Applicant dated May 1, 2009, which Department Counsel indicates was Applicant\u2019s\noriginal answer to the SOR allegations. W hether due to a copying error or some other cause, text was\nmissing, from lines 3 through 10 and 12 through 19, of Item 7 forwarded to me for review. At my request, Chief\nDepartment Counsel submitted a complete copy of the document by facsimile on March 22, 2010, and it was\nincluded in Item 7.\nApplicant did not indicate on his e-QIP that the company was a federal contractor (Item 4). But in his\n3\nletter of May 1, 2009, Applicant related that he was \u201ctraveling all over the world doing projects\u201d and was\nabroad working on a consulate. He is apparently seeking a secret-level security clearance (Item 7).\n2\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 3, 2009. There is no indication in the file\nsubmitted for review that he requested a hearing.  On August 12, 2009, the government\n1\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7).2\nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within\n30 days of receipt. No response was received by the October 11, 2009, due-date. On\nDecember 2, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\neight delinquent debts totaling $25,667 (SOR 1.a-1.h) (Item 1). Applicant indicated the\n$435 tax lien in SOR 1.a had been paid, and that the $389 telephone debt in SOR 1.c\nand the $1,600 debt in SOR 1.h were pending negotiations and would be \u201ccorrected\u201d by\n2010. Applicant denied any responsibility for the other debts in the SOR and averred\nthey had been cleared from his credit report (Item 3). After considering the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old electrician, who worked for a defense contractor in a\nwar zone in Southwest Asia from August 2004 to September 2005. He now works for a\ndifferent company performing installations in various countries, including at consulates\nabroad. He requires a secret-level security clearance.3\n\nI took judicial notice sua sponte of a map of the pertinent state. The municipality in which Applicant\n4\nmaintains his residency is incorporated within the county that issued the lien reported on his credit report. It\nis unclear whether this is a different lien from that reported on his e-QIP. The county named on his e-QIP is\n3\nIn May 2000, Applicant purchased his home by taking out a 30-year mortgage of\n$91,650, to be repaid at $1,036 per month (Item 3, 5). In October 2002, he went into\nbusiness for himself, as an electrical contractor (Item 4). He began having financial\ntroubles when he had to cover the cost of his father\u2019s burial sometime before August\n2004. He terminated a lease agreement prematurely around July 2003, and the lender\nplaced a balance of $1,215 for collection in March 2004 (SOR 1.h) (Item 3, 5). But the\nfull extent of his delinquencies at that time cannot be readily ascertained from the file.\nBefore Applicant left for Southwest Asia in August 2004, he retained the services\nof a credit resolution company to help him clear up his credit problems. His spouse was\nsupposed to work with the credit resolution company on his behalf while he was\noverseas, but she failed to do so (Item 4, 7). In September 2005, Applicant returned to\nthe U.S. and began working for his current employer. He and his spouse began to have\nmarital problems, in part over her spending (Item 7), and they were divorced in January\n2007 (Item 4). From February 2006 through June 2006, Applicant was regularly 30 days\nlate in his monthly mortgage payment. Over part of that time, from March 2006 to May\n2006, Applicant was in Southeast Asia on business for his employer (Item 4). As of July\n2006, his mortgage was 60 days past due. Applicant brought his mortgage current in\nAugust and September 2006, but he did not pay the mortgage on time for the months of\nOctober 2006 through February 2007, and April 2007. Applicant paid his mortgage on\ntime after April 2007 (Item 3).\nOn February 9, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP for a secret-level security\nclearance. In response to inquiries about his finances, he indicated that there was an\noutstanding lien against his business for $325.62 from December 2007. He tried to pay\nit, but was told there was no delinquency. He also listed a $2,965 judgment in collection\nsince February 2002, which he was trying to clear up because some of the charges\nwere not correct. Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to questions 28.a (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have\nyou been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d) and 28.b (\u201cAre you currently over\n90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d), listing two credit card balances of $1,423.27 and\n$1,220 from 2002. He was negotiating settlements on both accounts. He attributed his\ndebt problems to his divorce and the expenses of his father\u2019s burial:\nJust to give explanation of my troubles. I got over my head in credit\nproblems but was maintaining. I fell short after my father had passed away\nwith the cost of burial. Once this happened then of course I fell too far\nbehind and tried to work with my creditors but could never catch up. I have\nsince divorced and this has compounded my situation but nevertheless I\nwill complete a recovery in all [financial matters] (Item 4).\nApplicant\u2019s consolidated credit report of April 2008 revealed that a $435 tax lien\nhad been filed against him in May 2005 by his county clerk,  and that a $2,965 judgment\n4\n\nadjacent to his county.\nApplicant made the payment not to his county, but to the adjacent county (Item 3), which may or may\n5\nnot be authorized to accept payments of property taxes assessed in surrounding areas.\n4\nhad been awarded a credit card lender in September 2001. Several collection debts\nalso were on his record:  $389 for wireless telephone services (SOR 1.c), $13,416 on\nan installment loan that had a high credit of $4,590 (SOR 1.d), $1,640 on an installment\naccount with a home improvement retailer (SOR 1.g), $4,821 in a credit card balance\n(SOR 1.f), and $1,600 for early termination of a lease (SOR 1.h). Applicant was listed as\nan authorized user on a credit card account with a delinquent $401 balance (SOR 1.e)\n(Item 5).\nAround the fall of 2008, DOHA asked Applicant to verify the current status and\nany payments of the debts on his credit report. Applicant responded that some of the\ndebts \u201cocurred [sic] due to [his] ex-wife.\u201d He asserted that he had worked through a debt\nresolution firm to reduce and eventually eliminate his debts before his divorce, but that\nhe was seeking assistance from a better debt management company to take care of his\ndebts by 2010. Applicant provided DOHA with an agreement dated November 3, 2008,\nbetween him and a new credit services firm. Applicant agreed to pay a retainer fee of\n$781 plus $99 monthly for the company to audit the credit reporting agencies and\nApplicant\u2019s creditors, and to demand that any information on Applicant\u2019s credit report\nthat is erroneous or inaccurate be corrected or deleted (Item 6).\nIn April 2009, Applicant was 30 days past due on his automobile loan payment.\nHe had taken out a loan of $11,729 in October 2008, to be repaid at $256 per month for\n60 months (Item 3). Applicant was apparently overseas working at the time. On May 1,\n2009, Applicant notified DOHA that the information on his credit report was outdated,\nand that he was working with a credit repair agency to correct the issues. He had been\nunsuccessful in obtaining a recent credit record due to him being overseas working on a\nnew consulate. He was scheduled to return to the U.S. on May 24, 2009, and would\nobtain a credit report at that time to submit to DOHA (Item 7). He brought his automobile\nloan current in May 2009 (Item 3).\nDOHA issued an SOR to Applicant on June 25, 2009, alleging the unpaid tax and\ncredit card judgments (SOR 1.a, 1.b), and the six collection debts that appeared on his\nApril 2008 credit report (SOR 1.c-1.h) (Item 1). On July 21, 2009, Applicant obtained a\ncredit report from each of the three credit reporting agencies. Trans Union reported as\nadverse accounts only the state tax lien of $435, the wireless telephone debt of $389,\nand Applicant\u2019s mortgage, which was current but had been last delinquent in April 2007.\nExperian reported the wireless telephone debt and the mortgage (again because of late\npayments in the past), but also the debt owed the leasing company (SOR 1.h). Equifax\nreported no negative accounts and no collections on file (Item 3). On July 23, 2009,\nApplicant paid a county property tax debt of $361.23 plus a convenience fee of $9.03\nonline.  On August 3, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR. He cited his recent property\n5\ntax payment as evidence that the debt in SOR 1.a had been paid. Applicant indicated\n\n5\nthat false credit information had been reported on his record, including the debts alleged\nin SOR 1.b through 1.g, that had been deleted per his updated July 2009 credit report.\nHe added that he had been told by his interviewer that he would be given some time to\nresolve the issues on his credit record, which he had not checked in many years (\u201cI just\ncannot understand how false information can be posted on a report but mistakes do\nhappen\u201d). As for the verified debts in SOR 1.c and 1.h, Applicant indicated they were\npending negotiation and would be corrected by 2010 (Item 3).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\n\n6\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant admitted to a history of financial delinquency when he applied for his\nsecurity clearance in February 2008 (Item 4). He was not specific about the extent and\nnature of his past due accounts. While he listed four debts totaling $5,933.89 (including\ntwo credit card delinquencies that may or may not appear on his April 2008 credit\nreport), he disputed the balance of the $2,965 judgment debt (Item 4). A subsequent\ncheck of his credit in April 2008 revealed an outstanding tax lien, albeit of $435 rather\nthan $325, and the $2,965 judgment debt. But also on his credit record were six\ncollection accounts totaling $22,267, all but $1,989 (SOR 1.c, 1.h) disputed by\nApplicant. While Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision (see Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.15), Department Counsel\nhas the burden to establish facts in the SOR that have been controverted (see Directive\n5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.14). AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c),\n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d are established, but the evidence falls\nshort of substantiating the amount of delinquency alleged by the government.\nApplicant\u2019s credit report of July 21, 2009, confirms the validity of the tax lien, the\nwireless phone debt, and the leasing company debt, which altogether total about\n$2,424. As noted by the government in the FORM, it is unclear whether the online tax\npayment of $361.23, to a county adjacent to the county that filed the lien, suffices to\nresolve the $435 tax lien. As for the contested debts, the government submits that\nremoval of the debts from Applicant\u2019s credit report is circumstantial evidence of a valid\ndispute but is not dispositive of whether Applicant owed the debt. Applicant was\nsufficiently concerned about the information on his credit record to retain the services of\na credit restoration company in November 2008 to pursue the deletion of inaccurate or\nerroneous information from his credit record, and most of the collection debt had been\nremoved.  AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\n\n7\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d applies in part. Furthermore, the deletion of the adverse information from\nApplicant\u2019s credit record raises considerable doubt about the extent to which the April\n2008 credit report can be relied on to establish Applicant\u2019s indebtedness.\nThat being said, Applicant knew as of February 2008 that a judgment of $2,965\nhad been awarded against him (SOR 1.b). It is unclear whether all of the charges on\nthat credit account were determined to be illegitimate, as his denial of the debt would\nsuggest. On his e-QIP, he stated that \u201csome\u201d of the charges were not correct. Even if\nApplicant had resolved the two credit card debts on his e-QIP, and if all or part of the\njudgment debt in the SOR was determined to be invalid or not his responsibility, his\ncredit situation has not always been as stable as it now appears. Although not alleged,\nApplicant had a history of late payments on his mortgage, albeit primarily when he was\noverseas for business and later around his divorce.\nApplicant presented no evidence showing that the undisputed debts in SOR 1.c\nand 1.h have been paid, even if the July 2009 property tax payment covered the tax\njudgment filed in 2005. So, it is difficult to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies, in that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were due in part to his ex-spouse, and to the unexpected costs of his father\u2019s\nburial. Applicant was in Southwest Asia working with the U.S. military in a war zone\nfrom August 2004 to September 2005, when the tax lien was filed against him. His ex-\nspouse failed to work with the credit restoration agency while he was overseas, and her\nspending contributed to their subsequent divorce (\u201cAll she could do was waste my\nmoney while I [sic] being patriotic and hence the divorce reason.\u201d Item 7).\nApplicant knew in February 2008 that his financial issues could be of concern to\nthe Department of Defense. He \u201cinitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d which is required under AG \u00b6 20(d), by retaining the\nservices of a credit restoration company in November 2008 to investigate debt\ninformation that appeared to him to be incorrect. The company acted as his agent while\nhe was working overseas. Applicant\u2019s payment of a property tax debt in July 2009 is\nevidence of his intent to pay his legitimate financial obligations, irrespective of whether\nthat payment resolved the tax lien.\nApplicant elected not to respond to the FORM, so the status of any negotiations\nwith the creditors in SOR 1.c and 1.h is unknown. Certainly, Applicant\u2019s case in\nmitigation would have been stronger had he presented evidence of recent payments on\nthose verified debts. But his overall financial picture is now stable. His July 2009 credit\n\n8\nreport shows no new accounts delinquent over 90 days. He has been timely in his\nmortgage payments since May 2007. As of April 2009, he was past due 30 days on an\nautomobile loan taken out in October 2008 for $11,729, but it was when he was working\non a consulate abroad. He brought the account current in May 2009. The credit card\ndelinquencies he listed on his e-QIP are not on his July 2009 credit report, so it is likely\nthat they have been resolved or successfully disputed. He is likely to resolve his\nremaining financial issues in the near future. AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d applies.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). Applicant took\naction to investigate debt information that did not seem accurate to him, and most of the\ndebt listed on his April 2008 credit report has been deleted. Business assignments\noverseas do not relieve him of his responsibility for monitoring his credit, but he now\nknows that failure to do so can have adverse consequences in time and money. Based\non what can be gleaned from his July 2009 credit report, his present financial situation\ncauses little concern. I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance at this time.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Tr. 33) In 1998, \nhe achieved his Bachelor of Arts degree in religion and in May 2002, he received a \nmaster\u2019s degree in religion. (Tr. 33) Applicant obtained student loans to pay for his \neducation. Student loans are listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($52,360) and SOR \u00b6 1.j ($26,337). In \nhis response to the SOR, Applicant denied these two debts. Applicant\u2019s May 2008 CBR \nand September 2008 CBR reflect numerous student loans obtained between July 1997 \nand September 2003. (Ex. 2, 3) His student loans were to be deferred while he was on \nactive duty.  \n \nApplicant also has private student loans which are currently in deferral until \nFebruary 2010. (Ex. C, Tr. 33) Applicant\u2019s May 2008 CBR lists the amount in excess of \n$20,000. (Ex. 3) Applicant\u2019s September 2008 CBR lists the amount in excess of \n$101,000. (Ex. 2) Applicant currently pays $438 monthly on his student loans. As of \nNovember 2008, Applicant owed the Department of Education approximately $98,000. \n(Ex. C)  \n \n \nApplicant was married from 1981 until 1990, and from December 1998 until May \n2002. (Tr. 36, Ex. 1) The day following his May 2002 graduation, his divorce became \n2  \n\nfinal. (Tr. 25, 27) From the end of May 2002 through January 2003, Applicant was \nhomeless. (Tr. 25) The little money he was getting from his military reserve pay went to \npaying his child support. (Tr. 26) Applicant provided no information as to his \nunemployment or as to why he was homeless.  \n \nIn 2003, he moved from California to live with his daughter in Texas. (Tr. 27) He \nfound employment as a substitute teacher and part-time as a security guard. (Tr. 28) \nWhen his rent increased from $650 to $1,000 per month, he left the apartment. (Tr. 32, \n39) He does not know why the amount he yet owes is so large. (Tr. 40) He was not \nbehind on his rent when he notified the apartment complex he was leaving. After he left, \nthe creditor placed an $8,975 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) account for collection. Eight months \nremained on his one-year lease. (Tr. 51) Applicant admitted he owed this debt, in his \nresponse to the SOR. \n \nIn February 2005, Applicant was called to active duty for 18 months. (Tr. 28) In \nNovember 2006, having been diagnosed with cancer, Applicant was medically \ndischarged at the rank of E-5. Applicant receives $1,200 in military retirement and a \n$200 payment from the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) having received a VA disability \nrating of 20%. (Tr. 29, 36) In July 2009, he intents to go to court to argue for full \nretirement and an increase in his VA disability rating. (Tr. 29)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s retirement and unemployment compensation he was to receive after \nleaving active duty was intercepted and sent to his ex-wife for child support. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant pays his ex-wife $550 per month child support. Applicant\u2019s September 2008 \ncredit bureau report (CBR) lists a balance of $52,126. Applicant\u2019s children, now ages \n24, 26, and 28, are from his first marriage. Applicant incurred the child support \nobligation when the children were minors and he was unable to make his payments.  \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant obtained his current job. (Tr. 30) He was laid off from \nwork for two weeks in 2007, for a month in 2008, and more than a week in 2009. (Tr. \n38, 44) His weekly take-home pay from his civilian job is $700. (Tr. 44) His $550 \nmonthly child support payment is automatically deducted from his pay. (Tr. 46) After \nchild support and taxes he receives $243 from the VA and $900 from the military. (Tr. \n47) He pays $300 rent per month, $150 per month for groceries, $100 per month for his \ncell phone, $180 gasoline expense per month, $82 monthly auto insurance, $200 \nmiscellaneous monthly expenses, and $800 monthly car payment on his car and his \ndaughter\u2019s car. Both his and his daughter\u2019s cars are 2004 models and both were \npurchased used. (Tr. 46, 47, 49) As previously stated, he pays $438 monthly on his \nstudent loan obligation.  \n \nApplicant has $300 in savings and $1,000 in a 401(k) retirement plan. He does \nnot have any credit cards. (Tr. 47, 48) His health insurance is paid by the military until \nJuly 2009. Prior to 2003, he received some financial counseling. (Tr. 48) Applicant is not \ncurrently being contacted by creditors concerning past due debt. Applicant hopes to \nobtain overseas employment paying more than his current job. (Tr. 54)  \n \n3  \n\nDuring a June 2008 or July 2008 interview, Applicant\u2019s debts were discussed \nusing a copy of his CBR. (Tr. 56)  A summary of Applicant\u2019s debts follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na \nAn overdraft account placed \nfor collection.

(Tr.26, 52)  \n \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n$117,145 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n5  \n\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-\nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant has 12 accounts placed for collection which total in excess of \n$38,000. Seven of Applicant\u2019s debts were under $500 each, and together totaled \napproximately $1,800. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n6  \n\n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe largest debts Applicant owes are his student loans and child support \nobligation. He is making $438 monthly payments on approximately $98,000 of student \nloans with the Department of Education. ($34) The student loans owed a private lender \nare deferred until February 2010. He was interviewed about his debts in June or July \n2008. Since that date, he has paid a $54 cable bill. Even though six additional debts are \nunder $500 each, he has paid only this one small debt since receiving the November \n2008 SOR.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant has numerous accounts placed for \ncollection, which remain unpaid. They are relatively recent having occurred following his \n2002 divorce. The debts are the types that are likely to recur and his failure to address \nthem does cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nAG & 20(b) applies because Applicant experienced divorce, loss of employment, \nwas homeless for seven months ending in January 2003, and currently suffers from \ncancer. Until July 2009, his medical insurance will be paid by the military. Applicant=s \nfinancial problems were contributed to by divorce and child support obligations. \nHowever, since obtaining his current job in April 2007, he has been unemployed for less \nthan two-months in that two-year period, and has only been able to pay one small debt. \n \n \nPrior to 2003, Applicant did receive some financial counseling. Currently, \ncreditors are not contacting him. However, there are no clear indications that the \n7  \n\nproblem is being resolved or is under control because more than $38,000 in 12 \naccounts remains unpaid. AG & 20(c) does not apply. \n \nAs of September 2008, the balance of his child support obligation was $52,126. \nHis child support obligation is not a debt of concern listed in the SOR.  However, how he \nmeets this obligation offers insight as to how Applicant addresses his financial \nobligations. His $550 monthly child support payments are automatically deducted from \nhis pay. Applicant is paying part of his student loan obligation and his other student \nloans are deferred until February 2010. His payment of these obligations reflects a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. AG & 20(d) \napplies to his student loans obligation and child support obligation.  \n \nAG & 20(e) does not apply because Applicant is not disputing the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debts. In his response to the SOR, the only debts he initially denied were \nhis student loans and two other debts totaling $110. At the hearing, Applicant stated \nthere were some debts he was uncertain about and did not know why two of the debts \nwere so large, but he provided no proof to substantiate he had disputed these debts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant incurred a large student \nloan obligation obtaining his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees, but is addressing those \nobligations. In 2002, he suffered the unfortunate events of both a divorce and being \nhomeless. Additionally, he was unemployed for periods of time.  \n \n The likelihood Applicant will address the unpaid accounts is based, in part, on \nwhat he has done since learning of the government\u2019s concern regarding his finances. \nDuring the summer of 2008, he was interviewed about his finances and past due \n8  \n\n9  \nobligations. In November 2008, the SOR was issued. Other than his child support and \nstudent loan payments, in the five months following the SOR, he paid only a single debt \nof less than $100. Other relatively small obligations remain unpaid. Two of the unpaid \naccounts placed for collection were under $100 each. Seven of Applicant\u2019s debts were \nunder $500 each. Applicant has done little to address his financial problems. He has \nfailed to mitigate or rebut the financial considerations security concern. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established \ncompliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a clearance at \nthis time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i and 1.j:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1. m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant written interrogatories  regarding adverse financial information in his\n1\nbackground. After Applicant responded to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were\nunable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the\n2\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included nine documents (Items 1 - 9) proffered in\n4\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On October 29,\n2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nraise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under\n3\nGuideline F (financial considerations). Applicant timely responded to the SOR and\nrequested a decision without a hearing. On January 16, 2009, Department Counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s\n4\npreliminary decision. Applicant received the FORM on February 1, 2009, and timely\nresponded to it. The case was assigned to me on February 20, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in\nAugust 2008, and that they disclosed liabilities of approximately $428,583.

He also submitted a copy of a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy petition he and his wife filed on August 22, 2008. In that petition, they\ndeclared $428,583.79 in liabilities against $254,615 in assets. (FORM, Item 8) It\nappears from a review of information in the bankruptcy petition, which lists a trade or\nbusiness name along with certain types of personal property used as collateral for\ncreditors\u2019 secured claims, that Applicant and his wife may have been in business for\nthemselves recently. However, it is unclear how, if at all, any of the unpaid debts listed\nin Schedules E and F were related to possible business ventures. Further, the\ninformation presented in the petition about their income versus expenses shows that, as\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n3\nof the bankruptcy filing, Applicant and his wife actually had a negative monthly cashflow.\n(FORM, Item 8)\nAccording to the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant was interviewed by a\ngovernment investigator in May 2008. However, there is no information in the record\nabout the results of that interview that may have shed some light on Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances. Nor did Applicant provide any amplifying information with her admission\nto the single SOR allegation. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated only he had\nnothing new to add, that he could not afford an attorney to help him, and that he was\nworking to overcome his financial problems. He also alluded to unspecified bad\nbusiness decisions that (presumably) caused his debts.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.a. Further, Applicant admitted the allegation without explanation. The presence of\nrecent unpaid debt and an apparent inability to pay require application of the\ndisqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG\n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Additionally, the sheer volume of\ndebt owed through personal credit card accounts suggests that Applicant may have\nbeen irresponsible in his spending habits. Such would require application of the\ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt).\nIn response, Applicant has provided no information that would support\napplication of any of the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 20. It would have been\nhelpful to have more investigative information about the origin and/or current status of\nApplicant\u2019s debts. As to his current and future financial prospects, his PFS reflects a\nsignificant positive cash flow each month; however, the bankruptcy petition shows a\nnegative monthly cashflow. Regardless, the government established that Applicant has\nincurred significant unpaid personal debt. This was sufficient to support the\ngovernment\u2019s preliminary decision to deny Applicant\u2019s request for a clearance. Thus,\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n5\nthe burden shifted to the Applicant to present sufficient information to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised by the facts established through the SOR. Applicant had two\nopportunities to present that information \u2013 when he responded to the SOR and/or when\nhe responded to the FORM. Applicant\u2019s resolution of his debts through bankruptcy,\nwithout more information about, for example, the causes of the debts, his current\nfinances, and the prospects for his finances in the future, is not enough to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns about Applicant\u2019s suitability.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). However, aside from the fact of\nApplicant\u2019s age and personal history, there is no available information aside from the\nfact of his recent financial problems that would support application of any of the whole\nperson factors. As such, significant doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n9\ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows he has failed to address satisfactorily\nthe government\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s\ninterests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

His eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on April 10, 2008. On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nApril 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 29, 2008.  His answer to the SOR was \nundated and contained one attachment, which was admitted, without objection, as \nApplicant\u2019s exhibit (Ex.) A. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant requested that his case \nbe determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) on February 19, 2009. The FORM contained documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 7. By letter dated February 20, 2009, DOHA forwarded a \ncopy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information \nand/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on February 26, \n2009. His response was due on March 28, 2009. He filed additional information within \nthe required time period. Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s submissions, \nwhich have been identified as Ex.s B through N and admitted to the record. On March \n26, 2009, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 17 allegations of financial delinquency under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q.) and two allegations of disqualifying conduct \nunder AG E, Personal Conduct. (Item 1.) In his undated Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted 14 of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., \n1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.p.) He denied three Guideline F \nallegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c., and 1.q.). He denied the two Guideline E allegations of \ndeliberate falsification of answers on his e-QIP. (\u00b6 2.a. and \u00b6 2.b.).  (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and employed in a computer support position by a \nfederal contractor. He has a high school diploma and some additional vocational school \ntraining. In 1973, he enlisted in the U.S. military, served for three years, and received an \nhonorable discharge. He was married in 1978, and he has three adult children. In \nOctober 2008, he reported a net monthly salary of $2,370. His fixed monthly expenses \nwere $770, and he paid $2,064 toward his mortgage and three debts. His budget \nshowed a negative monthly remainder of $463. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 6, 8-9.) \n \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged on the SOR total $38,736. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted responsibility for debts totaling $34,898. Credit reports \nsupplied by Applicant and the government showed his debts arose between \napproximately 2005 and 2008. Judgments were levied against him in 2005, 2006, and \n2007. He provided documentation to corroborate his assertion that a judgment levied \nagainst him in 2007 had been satisfied by wage garnishment and released. Additionally, \nhe provided documentation to corroborate his statement that a judgment for $470, \nlevied by a medical provider, had been satisfied on August 5, 2005. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.c; Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6; Item 7; Ex. C; Ex. D; Ex. E.) \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \n \nIn addressing his additional debts, Applicant admitted financial responsibility for \nnine accounts in collection status (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., 1.o., and   \n1.p.) He denied and planned to dispute one collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.q.). He \nadmitted one unsatisfied judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.b.), one education account in charged-off \nstatus (SOR \u00b61.j.), one account that was 90 days past due (SOR \u00b6 1.m.), and an \nunsatisfied debt resulting from the involuntary repossession of an automobile (SOR \u00b6 \n1.n.) He also admitted an arrearage of $7,169 on his home mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.l.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that his financial \ndelinquencies had arisen because his wife had lost her job and he had taken a large \npay cut in order to keep his job.1 He did not specify when these events occurred or \nreport how much income he and his wife had lost to unemployment and \nunderemployment. (Item 7.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided a work sheet showing balances \ndue on his debts, contacts he had made with creditors, and amounts he intended to pay \neach month to satisfy his delinquent debts. In response to the FORM, he provided \ndocumentation to show he had made a payment of $50 on March 9, 2009 on a $1,586 \njudgment levied by a medical provider (SOR \u00b6 1.b.); a payment of $25 on a $43 \ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 1.d.); and a payment of $25 on March 12, 2009 on a debt of \n$9,784 resulting from an involuntary repossession of an automobile (SOR \u00b6 1.n.).  (Item \n3, Ex. A; Response to FORM; Ex. G; Ex. J.) \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation to show he had entered into a payment plan \nwith a creditor on the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.m and had made a payment of $85. He \nprovided documentation showing a payment of $25 on a $323 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.p. He also provided documentation to support his statement that he had made a \npayment of $25 on February 10, 2009 on a charged-off education debt of $2,320, \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j.  (Response to FORM, Ex. N; Ex. J; Ex. H.) \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant acknowledged he had no payment plan \nin place for a $10,055 credit card debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1. k., or a $529 debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.o. He also stated he was working with his mortgage holder on a forbearance \nplan.  A notation on an exhibit in his response to the FORM indicated that his January \n2009 mortgage payment was returned to him by the mortgage holder, suggesting that a \nsatisfactory plan to address his arrearages was not yet in place. (Response to FORM; \nEx. B; Ex. M.) \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated his intent to dispute the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.q. on the advice of the creditor.  He provided no documentation to \nindicate that he had filed a dispute. (Response to FORM; Ex. B.) \n \n1Applicant\u2019s Ex. A shows income of $936 for his wife. This appears to be a monthly income in addition to \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly salary of $2,370.  Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories also shows that \nApplicant\u2019s net biweekly pay appeared to be only $1,185.14. The record is not clear regarding Applicant\u2019s \nnet monthly family income. (Ex. A; Item 7.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant completed and certified an e-QIP on April 10, 2008. Section 28 on the \ne-QIP asks the following questions: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days \ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?\u201d \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. At the time he completed the e-QIP, he   \nfailed to disclose that he was delinquent on the accounts set forth in \u00b6 1.b. and \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. \nthrough 1. q. of the SOR.2  (Item 4.) \n \n \nSection 27 of the e-QIP asks several questions about an applicant\u2019s financial \nrecord. Question 27d asks: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against \nyou that have not been paid?\u201d  Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 27d.  He did not \nreport a judgment filed against him in June 2006 for approximately $1,586 which had \nnot been paid. In his answer to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that when he \ncompleted his e-QIP, he was aware of only the judgment alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a., which \nhad been satisfied by garnishment in approximately September 2007. He responded \naffirmatively to Question 27b, which asks: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had your wages \ngarnished or had any property repossessed for any reason?\u201d  He then listed the wage \ngarnishment related to the judgment alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. He did not list the involuntary \nrepossession of the automobile alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.n.3  (Item 5; Item 7.) \n \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied intentionally falsifying his SF-86 by \nfailing to report debts of over 180 days in the past 7 years and any current debts that \nwere 90 days delinquent. He also denied that his failure to list the judgment alleged at \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. was deliberate falsification. \n \n \nApplicant and his wife planned to begin credit counseling on March 19, 2009.  \n(Response to FORM; Ex. B)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \n \n2 Applicant denied the judgments alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.c. of the SOR and provided documentation to \ncorroborate that the judgments were satisfied in 2005 and 2007, before he completed his e-QIP in April \n2008.  \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s credit reports show that the automobile repossession occurred after Applicant completed his \ne-QIP. (Item 6; Item 7.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n6 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to \npay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d  (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual initiated a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).  Finally, security concerns \nrelated to financial delinquencies might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (e)). \n   \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least 2005 and \n2006. His delinquencies are recent and on-going. They have occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur.  \n \nApplicant and his wife experienced a financial downturn when she lost her job \nand, at the same time, he took a pay cut in order to retain his job. The record indicates \nthat these circumstances contributed to his delinquencies and were beyond his control. \nTo show good faith in resolving his many financial delinquencies, Applicant has made \ninitial payments on some of his debts, and he promises to pay or settle most his debts in \nthe future. However, one of his major delinquencies, a debt of over $10,000 to a credit \ncard company, remains unresolved. The record is unclear regarding the status of his \nhome mortgage arrearages. Applicant reported that he and his wife were scheduled to \nbegin financial counseling in mid-March 2009. In determining an individual's security \nworthiness, the Government cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might \nresolve his or her outstanding debts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) apply to the facts of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s case. I also conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply in \nmitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and signed his e-QIP in April 2008, he responded \n\u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the \nlast seven years. He answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he was currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt. He answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he had any \njudgments placed against him in the last seven years that had not been paid.   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Appellant\u2019s responses to the financial questions on his e-\nQIP showed he had deliberately falsified material facts by deliberately failing to admit \nand disclose a judgment, debts that were delinquent over 180 days in the last seven \nyears, and debts that were currently 90 days delinquent.  \n  \nThis information raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), which reads as \nfollows: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d  AG \u00b617(a).     \n \nApplicant did not make good-faith efforts to correct the omissions before being \nconfronted with the facts. He denied his answers constituted deliberate falsification, and \nhe offered no explanation for his failure to acknowledge or report on his e-QIP long-\nstanding financial delinquencies that totaled nearly $35,000. \n \nWhen he completed his e-QIP, Applicant also denied knowledge of any unpaid \njudgments against him. In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that when he \ncompleted his e-QIP, he was only aware of the judgment alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a, the \njudgment that caused Applicant\u2019s wages to be garnished in 2007. He did not report a \njudgment for $1,586, filed against him by a medical provider in June 2006. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s silence and failure to address these omissions is a matter of security \nconcern. He provided no credible evidence to mitigate his failure to report his financial \ndelinquencies on his e-QIP. Nothing in the record suggests that he took prompt good \nfaith action to correct the omissions, concealments or falsifications before he was \nconfronted with the facts. AG \u00b6 17(a).  I conclude that his falsifications were deliberate.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. For a period of time before \ncompleting his e-QIP, Applicant was aware of his financial delinquencies, which dated \nto at least 2005. Most of his actions to pay or settle his financial delinquencies were \nrecent. While he made preliminary payments to some of his debtors, he had not \nestablished a track record of consistent  payment of his debts over a period of time. \n \n He allowed three debts to proceed to judgment. One judgment was satisfied in \n2005; the other judgment was resolved by garnishment, thereby putting Applicant on \nnotice that he had financial problems. Even though he had financial difficulties, he did \nnot approach his creditors, alert them to his financial problems, and attempt to find a \nresponsible resolution for paying or settling his debts. \n \nTo their credit, Applicant and his wife are seeking financial counseling, and they \nmight find it beneficial to seek legal advice about resolving their debts and acquiring \nfinancial stability in the near term. Applicant can reapply for a security clearance one \nyear after the date that this decision becomes final. If he wishes, he can produce new \nevidence that addresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:         \n           For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n through 1.q: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 8, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 27, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issue: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\n \nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: The SOR alleged that Applicant\nowes approximately $17,500 for 16 delinquent debts, and Applicant admitted those debts.  Applicant\nbecame aware of the extent of his debt when he was interviewed as part of his background\ninvestigation.  Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished in 2005 to satisfy a child support arrearage.\nApplicant satisfied the arrearage and is now current on his child support obligation.  Applicant\nresolved a debt for unpaid rent which was incurred by his ex-wife.  Other than those two obligations,\nApplicant has not documented any steps to resolve his delinquent debts other than hiring a company\nwhich will resolve his debts over a period of time after Applicant pays them a fee.  As of the time\nof the hearing, Applicant could not document that the company had resolved any of his debts.\nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to periods of unemployment and to marital problems\nin his first marriage.  Applicant is highly regarded by his employer.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant discusses aspects of his financial situation, and he appends two\nrecent letters of recommendation from his employer and a letter from the debt resolution company.\nTo the extent that any of that information is new evidence that was not provided at the hearing, the\nBoard cannot consider it.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant states that the Judge misunderstood the terms of his agreement with the\ndebt resolution company.  To the extent that the Judge misstated the terms of the agreement, the\nerror is harmless, since the Judge discussed the agreement only to indicate that Applicant had not\nmade any progress in reducing his delinquent debts through his agreement with the company as of\nthe date of the hearing.  The record supports that conclusion.  Applicant  has not identified any\nharmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole,\nthe Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01105\nat 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2008).\n\n3\nApplicant argues that the Judge should have given more weight to his efforts to improve his\nfinancial situation.  Once the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.15.  In his Findings of Fact, the\nJudge referred to Applicant\u2019s testimony of mitigating circumstances.  Decision at 5-6.  However,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2007).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against his financial history and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and factors.  Decision at 5-6.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  Id.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,  2007).  The Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on April 10,\n2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $17,500\nfor 16 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p). It was further alleged that he had only $11\nremaining each month after expenses, which did not include payments for any of his\ndelinquent debts.

In addition to the facts established\nthrough Applicant\u2019s admissions, after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and the\nparties\u2019 exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. Since January 2008, he has worked as a principal\ninformation engineer for a defense contractor in the southeast United States. Before\nbeing hired for his current job, Applicant was unemployed for two months after he was\nlaid off from a software developer/business analyst job he had held since January 2006.\nPrior to that, he worked for the same company through a temp agency beginning in\nSeptember 2005. (Gx. 1)\nFor most of the previous ten years, Applicant lived and worked in the northwest\nUnited States. He worked as a bookkeeper for and helped run his mother\u2019s accounting\nbusiness from January 2001 until he moved to the southeast in August 2005. Applicant\nwas married from October 1995 until he and his ex-wife divorced in May 2006. They\nactually separated in September 2004. They had three children (now ages 12, 10, and\n8) for whom he pays $330 in monthly child support. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2)\nWhen he submitted his SF 86, Applicant disclosed that his wages were garnished\nin 2005 to satisfy an arrearage in his child support payments. He has since satisfied that\ndebt and remains current in his support obligations. (Ax. B; Gx. 1; Gx. 2) He also\ndisclosed through his SF 86 that he was more than 180 days past due in the amount of\n$6,000 on a loan for a car he bought in 2001. The subsequent background investigation\nand supplemental DOHA interrogatories established that Applicant owed the debts\nalleged in the SOR.(Gx. 2; Gx. 3)\n\n3\nAs of the hearing, none of the debts listed in the SOR have been paid or\notherwise resolved. (Tr. 54 - 69) Applicant first became aware of the full scope of his\nindebtedness when he was interviewed by a government investigator in March 2008 as\npart of his background investigation. Thereafter, he resolved his child support arrearage\nand a debt for unpaid rent that was incurred by his wife after he moved out in\nSeptember 2004. (Gx. 2; Ax. B; Tr. 60, 87 - 88) However, he took no other action to pay\nor otherwise resolve his debts until after he received the SOR. At that time, he enrolled\nin a debt solution program. He pays a company $264 each month to negotiate and/or\nrestructure his outstanding debts. The plan calls for resolution of the debts listed in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d - 1.f, 1.h - 1.j, and 1.l - 1.p, over the next 36 months. The total to be paid\nis roughly 55% of the actual debt owed. However, there is no information confirming that\nApplicant has actually made payments pursuant to the plan and/or that any of the debts\nhave yet been negotiated or resolved. The monthly payments go to the debt solution\ncompany to satisfy its fee of 15% of the total debt owed ($2,586.75). Thus, it appears no\nfunds will be paid to Applicant\u2019s creditors for the first 10 months of the plan. (Ax. A) The\ndebts not included in the plan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g and 1.k) total $270.\nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to a period of unemployment between\n1996 and 1998 after he suffered an on-the-job injury. He and his first wife lived off her\nincome and his disability checks. He returned to work with a communications company\nin 1998, but over the next four years, Applicant and his family moved frequently, lived\nwith relatives, and briefly lived in a tent. (Gx. 2; Tr. 39 - 40) To make matters worse, he\nwas fired from his job in 2000 for poor performance. Applicant claims he was unable to\nfunction after he learned his first wife was having an affair with his best friend. (Tr. 81 -\n82) In 2002, he returned briefly to school, which he paid for using student loans. Five\nfederally guaranteed student loans had been in a collection status before Applicant\nconsolidated them in September 2005. They now appear to be in good standing. (Gx. 3)\nOne loan was received directly from the school and is still delinquent in the amount of\n$1,916 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). (Gx. 3)\nIn November 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories about his\nfinances. (Gx. 2) Part of his response included a personal financial statement (PFS) that\nshowed he had less than $20 left each month after expenses. At hearing, he submitted\ninformation showing he had about $463 remaining each month. (Ax. C) He explained\nthat he remarried in October 2008, and his new wife contributes about $500 each month\nto rent and utilities. However, he also disclosed that she is currently unable to work\nbecause of a heart condition. Applicant further testified that \u201cextra entertainment\u201d uses\nup the money they have left over each month. (Tr. 71 - 76)\nApplicant is successful at his current job. He is well regarded by management\nfor his diligence, reliability, and overall job performance. His most recent performance\nevaluation was positive, and he was given a 6% raise as a result. (Tr. 98 - 112)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n4\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,3\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n5\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n5\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.6\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a - 1.p. Since about 2002, Applicant has incurred approximately $17,245 in\nunpaid and delinquent debt. The government\u2019s information also established that, as of\nSeptember 16, 2008, Applicant had a marginally positive monthly cash flow of about\n$11 after expenses, which did not include repayments of any of his past due debts.\nApplicant further admitted the SOR allegations. The information presented by both the\ngovernment and the Applicant further shows that the debts remained unpaid as of the\ndate of Applicant\u2019s hearing. Available information requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nApplicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s information relies, in part, on the fact\nthat he was unemployed due to an on-the-job injury for two years until 1998. He was\nalso unemployed for nearly a year after being fired from his job in 2000. However, he\nworked steadily from 2001 until 2005, when he moved across country while his divorce\nwas pending. He found work almost immediately on relocating and has been employed\nfor all but two months since August 2005. Applicant also avers that his divorce was a\ncontributing factor in his financial problems. I have considered the potential application\nof the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances); however, Applicant\u2019s extended\nunemployment occurred over ten years ago. His unemployment after being fired, while\ncertainly a factor, is also dated as he has been almost constantly employed since 2001.\nHe has not shown how a period of unemployment eight years ago has kept him from\npaying or otherwise addressing his debts. As for the possible adverse financial effects\nof his divorce, it was finalized in 2006, but he and his ex-wife separated in 2004. Again,\nhe has not demonstrated how those events have either caused his debts or precluded\nhim from resolving them.\n\n See footnote 6, supra. \n7\n6\nIn light of Applicant\u2019s enrollment in a debt resolution plan and his claim he now\nhas at least $400 in positive monthly cash flow, I have also considered the possible\napplication of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control) and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Available information does\nnot support application of either factor. As to his debt resolution plan, he did not\nundertake this or any similar action until after he received the SOR. Further, it is unclear\nif he is actually making any payments through the plan or if an agreement has actually\nbeen finalized. Nor is there any indication that he engaged in any systematic effort to\nresolve his debts until he thought he might lose his clearance. As to his claim that he\nand his new wife have more money left over after paying their monthly expenses,\nApplicant testified both that the money left over each month is used for entertainment\nand that his wife is not currently working for medical reasons. In short, Applicant\u2019s\ninformation in response to the government\u2019s case does not show that his finances have\nimproved or that his past due debts are being resolved. He has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns raised by the available information about his finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant appears to be a\nmature, reliable employee whose supervisors at work endorsed his appeal of the\npreliminary decision to deny his request for a clearance. There is positive information in\nhis background about his personal reliability (his recent salary increase and his job\nperformance) and about his finances (his resolution of a debt for unpaid rent incurred by\nhis ex-wife). However, this information must be weighed against his failure to resolve\neven the more modest debts in his credit history, the fact that some of his debts have\nbeen delinquent for almost seven years in some cases, and his failure to demonstrate\nthat his finances will not continue to be a concern in the near future. On balance, I\ncannot conclude that the favorable information in his background is sufficient to\novercome the doubts about his suitability for a security clearance. Because protection of\nthe national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be\nresolved in favor of the government.7\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for continued access to classified information. Request for\nsecurity clearance is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 27, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on April\n20, 2008 (Item 5).  On January 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on February 11, 2009, and requested\na decision without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on March 16, 2009.  The Applicant received the FORM on April\n8, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information.  She submitted\nadditional information on April 9, 2009, to which the Department Counsel had no\n\n2\nobjection.  The case was assigned to me on April 17, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 51 and married.  She is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admits allegations 1.a. through\n1.f., i.h., 1.j. through 1.p., and 1.r. through 1.w. of the SOR.  These admissions are\nhereby deemed findings of fact.  She denied the other allegations in the SOR. \nThe Applicant signed up with a non-profit Consumer Credit Counseling Service\n(CCCS) in October 2008.  The Applicant\u2019s Financial Counselor indicated that it took until\nJanuary 2009 for the Applicant and the CCCS to verify credit balances and enroll\ncreditors and collection agencies in the Applicant\u2019s debt management program.  (Item 4\nat 3.)  The Applicant has made two payments since the program began, with $830.00\navailable for disbursement. \nThe Applicant\u2019s CCCS account shows 22 creditor accounts, with some creditors\nhaving multiple accounts.  The original debt total is stated to be $6,231.39.  Her SOR\nshows 23 allegations, again with some creditors having multiple accounts.  The\nApplicant continues to dispute the debts set forth in subparagraphs i.g., i.i. and 1.r., as\nfurther described below.  Including those debts, the SOR alleges her indebtedness at\n$15,163.00.\nThe creditors named in the CCCS Monthly Statement for March 1, 2009, do not\nexactly match the creditors named in the SOR.  It is possible that the accounts set forth\nin the SOR have been acquired by other creditors.  \n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Central Financial for a\nmedical debt.  This debt is included in her CCCS plan and has been paid down from\n$174.31 to $155.49.

This debt is included in her CCCS plan and has been paid down from\n$131.80 to $112.51.  (Response to FORM at 8.) \n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Central Financial for a\nmedical debt.  This debt is included in her CCCS plan and has been paid down from\n$562.80 to $525.75.  (Response to FORM at 8.)   \n\n3\n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that she was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $212.00 for an account turned over by AT&T.  The Applicant states that the\naccount has been paid in full.  She provided a confirmation number and a telephone\nnumber.  (Response to FORM at 1.)\n1.e.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Central Financial for a\nmedical debt.  This debt is included in her CCCS plan and has been paid down from\n$39.96 to $20.22.

This debt is included in her CCCS plan and has been paid down from\n$106.03 to $86.58.  (Response to FORM at 8.) \n1.g.\nThe Applicant has consistently denied the existence of this debt to a\nhospital in the amount of $3,737.00.  (Item 4 at 1, Response to FORM at 1.)\n1.h.\nThe Applicant admits that she owes Rowan Collection Agency $199.00 for\na medical bill.  The SOR states the amount is $174.00.  The account number connected\nto this account in Item 7 at 2 and Item 8 at 11 does not match the three account\nnumbers for Rowan Collection Agency in her CCCS statement.  One account is stated\nto be for $199.20, and I find it to be the account in question.  This account has been\npaid down to $179.20.  (Response to FORM at 8.)  \n1.i.\nThe Applicant denies that she owes Absolute Collection Service $191.00\nfor a medical bill.  The account number connected to this account in Item 7 at 2 does\nnot match the three accounts included for Absolute Collection Service in her CCCS\nstatement.  (Response to FORM at 8.)\n1.j.\n The Applicant admits that she is indebted to NCO Financial for a medical\ndebt.  This debt is included in her CCCS plan and has been paid down from $150.00 to\n$100.00.  (Response to FORM at 8.)\n1.k.\nThe Applicant admits that she was indebted to Central Financial for a\nmedical debt.  This debt is included in her CCCS plan and the debt for $20.00 has been\npaid in full.  (Response to FORM at 8.)\n1.l.\n   The Applicant admits that she is indebted to Absolute Collection Service\nfor a medical debt.  This debt is included in her CCCS plan and has been paid down\nfrom $78.70 to $38.70.  (Response to FORM at 8.)\n1.m.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Absolute Collection Service\nfor a medical debt.  This debt is included in her CCCS plan and the debt has been paid\ndown from $126.50 to $86.50.  (Response to FORM at 8.)\n1.n.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Absolute Collection Service\nfor a medical debt.  This debt is included in her CCCS plan and the debt has been paid\ndown from $237.40 to $197.40.  (Response to FORM at 8.)\n\n4\n1.o.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Time Warner for a debt of\n$892.00.  She states in her Response to FORM at 1 that this is in a payment plan and\nthat she has paid $100.00 towards this debt.\n1.p.\nThe Applicant admits that she owed a debt to Arrow Financial in the\namount of $982.00.  However, in her Answer to the SOR (Item 4 at 1) she stated that it\nwas settled on January 31, 2009.  Under the particular circumstances of this case,\nparticularly the extent to which the Applicant has worked to collate and pay her bills, I\nfind this statement to be credible and believable without additional corroboration.\n1.q.\nThe Applicant has consistently denied that she owes this debt to\nAAC/Windstream for $495.00, stating that it is not her account.\n1r.\nThe Applicant admits that she owed a debt to NCO Financial in the\namount of $83.00.  However, in her Answer to the SOR (Item 4 at 1) she stated that it\nwas settled on January 5, 2009.  Under the particular circumstances of this case,\nparticularly the extent to which the Applicant has worked to collate and pay her bills, I\nfind this statement to be credible and believable without additional corroboration.\n1.s.\nThe Applicant admits that she owed a debt to Kelly Investments in the\namount of $6,131.00.00.  However, the Applicant submitted evidence showing that she\nhad settled and paid this debt for a lesser amount.  (Item 4 at 6-7; Response to FORM\nat 3-4.)\n1.t.\nThe Applicant admits that she was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $43.00 for an account turned over by Oreck Financial Services.  The\nApplicant states that the account has been paid in full.  She provided a confirmation\nnumber and a telephone number.  (Response to FORM at 1.)\n1.u.\nThe Applicant admits that she was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $217.00 for an account turned over by Oreck Financial Services.  The\nApplicant states that the account has been paid in full.  She provided a confirmation\nnumber and a telephone number.  (Response to FORM at 1.)\n1.v.\nThe Applicant admits that she was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $181.00 for an account turned over by Stanley Steamer.  The Applicant\nstates that the account has been paid in full.  She provided a confirmation number and a\ntelephone number.  (Response to FORM at 1.)\n1.w.\nThe Applicant admits that she was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $210.00 for an account turned over by City Cycle Sales.  The Applicant\nstates in her Answer to the SOR that the account would be paid in full.  (Item 4 at 1.)\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, particularly the extent to which the\nApplicant has worked to collate and pay her bills, I find this statement to be credible and\nbelievable without additional corroboration.\n\n5\nAs stated earlier, several accounts discussed in her CCCS account do not show\nup in the SOR.  These include two accounts to Central Financial Control, one account to\nFirstpoint Coll Resources, one account to Medical Data Systems, one account to\nProfessional Recovery, two accounts to Rowan Collection Agency, three accounts to\nStern & Associates and one account to West Asset Management.  The total amount the\nApplicant owes to these creditors is currently $3,736.00.  She currently owes $2,504.35\nfor the accounts in the SOR.  The Applicant\u2019s current total indebtedness is $6,240.35.\nHer total payments to all accounts amounts to $4,764.40. \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n6\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by her own admission, had over $14,000.00 in past\ndue debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  As set forth above,\u201cthere are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6\n20(c).  Specifically, she consulted with a CCCS, obtained credit counseling, and worked\ndiligently to fulfill their requirements to get into the program.  Other actions which\nsupport this finding are set forth below.\nThe Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off her creditors by enrolling\nin a credit repayment program, paying substantial funds into the program, and settling\nother accounts outside the program.  As shown above, she has halved her debt in a\nbrief period of time.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is also applicable.\n\n7\nThe Applicant has successfully shown that she is fulfilling her financial obligations\nand is now security worthy.  Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has made a sufficient\nshowing that her debt situation is under control.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct is not recent.  Based on the state of the record, I find that there have been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I\nfind that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6\n2(a)8)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.w.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn February 25, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive\nPositions (SF 86) to retain a security clearance required for his job with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a set of interrogatories  regarding information in his background. After\n1\nreviewing the results of the background investigation together with his response to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request\n2\nJuly 7, 2009\n\n Applicant has held a security clearance since March 1981.\n3\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n4\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nfor continued  access to classified information. On December 12, 2008, DOHA issued to\n3\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security\nconcerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F\n4\n(financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\noriginally assigned to an administrative judge on March 10, 2009, but was transferred to\nme on March 19, 2009. I convened a hearing on April 22, 2009, at which the parties\nappeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits (Gx. 1 - 4), which were\nincluded in the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I left the\nrecord open after the hearing to receive additional relevant information from the\nApplicant. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission was received on April 30, 2009, and\nincluded in the record without objection as Ax. A. DOHA received the transcript of\nhearing (Tr.) on May 7, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $38,653\nfor 16 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p). Applicant admitted all of the SOR\nallegations. He also claimed he had settled or paid the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.j\nand 1.m. In addition to the facts established through Applicant\u2019s admissions, after\nreviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and exhibits, I have made the following findings\nof relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old technical representative for a defense contractor\nproviding support services for helicopters used by the U.S. military. He served in the\nU.S. Navy as an aviation electrician\u2019s mate from 1981 until 1992. After attending college\nfor about 18 months after his discharge, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor in\nOctober 1993. He has been steadily employed doing the same work since then, but he\nhas had to change companies and relocate at least four times as the contract has\nchanged hands since February 2001. (Gx. 1; Tr., 23, 27, 40)\nApplicant was married from November 1983 until February 1996, when the\nmarriage ended in divorce. (Gx. 1) In 1987, he and his ex-wife filed for bankruptcy and\nwere discharged of about $27,000 in debts. Applicant claimed his debts at that time\nstemmed mainly from his ex-wife\u2019s spending habits and her failure to pay their bills\nwhile he was away on duty for the Navy. (Tr. 28 - 30)\nThe unpaid debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.j arose from medical services and\ntreatment related to Applicant\u2019s sleep apnea disorder between 2006 and 2008. (Tr. 49 -\n50) These debts represent costs and co-payments not covered by his insurance.\nApplicant claims he has paid and/or settled these debts. In support of his claim, he\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n3\nsubmitted post-hearing a three-page billing record from the hospital cited in the SOR.\n(Ax. A) \nIn 2001, Applicant borrowed $25,000 which he used to invest as a silent partner\nin a sports bar. He repaid the loan, but the business failed less than three years later.\nAfter the other partners in the business filed for bankruptcy, Applicant was sued by the\nbar\u2019s landlord for the balance due on their lease. As a result, Applicant now owes\n$33,622 for a civil judgment entered against him in 2004. Aside from a few payments\nmade through wage garnishment before he moved to his current location in 2005,\nApplicant has not made arrangements to pay this debt. He did not notify the creditor or\nthe court of his new address when he moved. (Gx. 1; Gx. 3; Gx. 4; Tr., 23 - 25, 32 - 36,\n46 - 48)\nSince 2000, Applicant has owed about $1,900 for two delinquent credit cards\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.n). He has also owed over the last nine years, a $228 debt to a credit\nunion (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and $545 to a furniture company (SOR \u00b6 1.p). Applicant has taken\nno action to pay or otherwise resolve these debts. Applicant also owes $82 for a\ndelinquent  telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.n). He claims to have paid this debt, but\nproduced nothing to document his claim. Finally, Applicant owes a $177 debt for a\nsatellite television account delinquent since 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.o). He has not paid this\naccount. (Gx. 3 and 4; Tr., 36 - 40)\nA personal financial statement (PFS) submitted in response to DOHA\ninterrogatories in October 2008 shows Applicant has about $1,250 remaining each\nmonth after expenses and loan payments. The PFS did not show that he is paying\nanything on the debts listed in the SOR. (Gx. 2; Tr. 41 - 44)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy\n6\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n7\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p. The facts thus established show that Applicant owes approximately\n$38,653 in delinquent debts dating back to at least 2000. The record requires\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n5\nAs to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.j, Ax. A shows a zero balance due on 11 office visits or\nprocedures between June 2006 and June 2008. Comparison of this document to the\ncredit reports proffered by the government (Gx. 3 and 4) does not directly corroborate\nApplicant\u2019s claim. However, this information shows ongoing medical services and\npayments over the time period at issue. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.j are resolved for Applicant.\nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s financial problems might be resolved by\napplication of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment), AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances), AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control), or AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nApplicant benefits from AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) as he demonstrated that he has paid or\notherwise resolved the medical debts alleged in the SOR. I have also considered\napplications of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) as the judgment for $32,000 arose from a downturn in\nbusiness. However, this mitigating condition does not apply. Applicant has not acted\nresponsibly in trying to resolve that debt and has failed over several years to resolve the\nfive debts under $1,000 each despite clearly having the financial means to do so. Such\ninaction outweighs the positive information about SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.j. Further, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c)\ndoes not apply because he has not sought any financial counseling or debt repayment\nassistance, and he has not established that his financial problems are under control. In\nsummary, Applicant has not submitted sufficient information to mitigate the Guideline F\nsecurity concerns established by this record. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 47 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. There is no available information about his reliability or\ntrustworthiness that would support a prediction that his finances have improved so as to\navoid more financial problems in the future. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all\n9\navailable information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances and truthfulness shows he has\nfailed to address satisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to\nprotect the government\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of\nthe government.  \n10\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k - 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 28-year-old performance enhancement specialist for a defense contractor. She is currently completing a doctorate in sport and exercise psychology. Married, she has a two-year-old son and is soon expecting a second child. In 1998, at age 17, Applicant began college with the hopes of ultimately earning a doctorate in sports psychology. Although a gifted student, her family could not afford to send her to college. Consequently, she relied on student loans and various jobs to finance her education. Mindful of cost and focused on attaining a doctorate, she completed her undergraduate degree in two-and-a-half years. By working full-time during her master\u2019s degree program over a three-year period, she kept abreast of her past debt and helped defray her current academic costs. She also invested in a townhouse as an alternative to paying rent. When she moved from the area to pursue her doctorate in 2004, she sold the property for a profit and paid off her credit cards. As a doctoral student, Applicant received a research assistantship which paid $10,000 per school year for 20 hours of work per week. Her future husband quit school in order to work and help pay for her education. Together, they purchased a foreclosure property in which to live.

On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response, Applicant admitted 13 of the 19 allegations noted in the\nSOR and requested a hearing. The matter was referred to DOHA on March 4, 2009,\nand the case was assigned to me that day. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed\nto a hearing date of April 2, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued to that effect on\nMarch 16, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and\noffered seven documents which were admitted without objection as exhibits (Exs.) A-G.\nJune 22, 2009\n\n Tr. 16.\n      1\n Tr. 17.\n      2\n Tr. 18.\n      3\n2\nDepartment Counsel offered four documents admitted as Exs. 1-4 without objection.\nThe record was held open for two weeks to permit Applicant to supplement the record.\nFive additional documents were accepted into the record without objection as Exs. H-L\non April 17, 2009. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received that same day\nand the record was closed. Based upon a review of the testimony, submissions, and\nexhibits, I find Applicant met her burden regarding the security concerns raised.\nSecurity clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 28-year-old performance enhancement specialist for a defense\ncontractor. She is currently completing a doctorate in sport and exercise psychology.\nMarried, she has a two-year-old son and is soon expecting a second child. \nIn 1998, at age 17, Applicant began college with the hopes of ultimately earning\na doctorate in sports psychology. Although a gifted student, her family could not afford\nto send her to college. Consequently, she relied on student loans and various jobs to\nfinance her education. Mindful of cost and focused on attaining a doctorate, she\ncompleted her undergraduate degree in two-and-a-half years. By working full-time\nduring her master\u2019s degree program over a three-year period, she kept abreast of her\npast debt and helped defray her current academic costs. She also invested in a\ntownhouse as an alternative to paying rent. When she moved from the area to pursue\nher doctorate in 2004, she sold the property for a profit and paid off her credit cards.\nAs a doctoral student, Applicant received a research assistantship which paid\n$10,000 per school year for 20 hours of work per week. Her future husband quit school\nin order to work and help pay for her education. Together, they purchased a foreclosure\nproperty in which to live. The home was bought for far less than its worth, but it needed\nrepairs and new appliances they had not anticipated. Consequently, they got \u201cinto a\nlittle bit of a hole that unfortunately [they] weren\u2019t really able to get out of as far as\ndebt.\u201d  \n1\nIn 2005, Applicant\u2019s fiancee was promoted to retail management. The extra\nincome helped with current obligations, but little was accomplished toward older debts.2\nApplicant accelerated her studies in order to join the work force as soon as possible. \nApplicant and her fiancee married in the summer of 2006. She finished her\ndoctoral course work in May 2007, around the time the couple had their son. Free from\nclasses, she immediately set out to find a job. She applied for many positions. One was\nfor a lucrative position for which she thought she was under-qualified, but was her\n\u201cdream job.\u201d  She was ultimately offered the position. The recruiters were so impressed\n3\n\n Ex. 4 (Credit report, dated Nov. 14, 2008) at 2-3; Ex. 2 (Interrogatories) at 11. Applicant testified that her\n      4\nschool incorrectly reported her as having graduated, thus triggering her student loans prematurely. Tr. 51-53.\nOtherwise, student loans are generally deferred until six months following withdrawal or graduation and\nforbearance can generally be requested for financial hardship. See www.salliemae.com (Apr. 2, 2009).\n Tr. 21.\n      5\n Tr. 26.\n      6\n Tr. 22.\n      7\n Tr. 26.\n      8\n Tr. 27-28; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; Ex. F (Statement, dated Mar. 10, 2009). Note that allegation\n      9\n1.f and 1.s are duplicate entries. Tr. 28.\n Ex. H (Applicant\u2019s narrative, dated Apr. 16, 2009); Ex. L (Bank statements).\n      10\n Tr. 29-30; Ex. J (Direct loans letter, dated Apr. 1, 2009); Ex. 1 (Loan facilitator payment history). See\n      11\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/ (Jun. 17, 2009), noting the average cumulative debt for undergraduate through\ndoctoral degree is approximately $53,500.\n3\nwith her, they gave her the location she requested and considered her their top\ncandidate. They continue to be impressed with her performance, promoting her to\nhigher levels of responsibility. In August 2007, Applicant and her husband put their\nhome on the market and moved to an area between their places of employment,\nrequiring both of them to commute an hour each way. Real estate sales were sluggish\nand progress on the home sale dragged on. Her new job helped her to start addressing\nher student loans, which became due in December 2008 despite the fact she was still\nqualified as a doctoral student and despite her request for forbearance based on her\nfinances.  \n4\nIn April 2008, their house finally sold. Applicant\u2019s husband accepted a lower\npaying job in order to shorten his commute and save commuting costs. With both\nspouses working, they quickly started addressing their delinquent debts.  Realizing they\n5\nneeded help in this task, she sought financial counseling advice from a nearby military\ninstallation. Applicant found this assistance to be \u201ca lot of benefit.\u201d  She also pursued\n6\nassistance through a debt counseling service. She pays the service $186 every two\nweeks and the service works out settlements with some of her creditors.  Despite these\n7\nefforts, Applicant feels she needs more guidance and is currently seeking additional\ncounseling to tackle her remaining debts.8\nAt issue in the SOR are 19 debts, set forth in allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.s.\nApplicant previously satisfied the debts identified at \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.s,\nrepresenting about $3,000.  Since the hearing, she submitted evidence that she has\n9\nbeen making payments on the $2,164 debt noted in allegation \u00b6 1.r.  The\n10\napproximately $35,000 in student loans noted in allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k\nwere recently consolidated and are in repayment.  Allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.q were\n11\n\n Tr. 28.\n      12\n Ex. 2 (Interrogatories) at 4.\n      13\n Ex.

Remaining unaddressed are the debts noted in SOR\n12\nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.l \u2013 1.p, representing approximately $21,000.\nApplicant\u2019s field is highly specialized and potentially very lucrative. By the\nbeginning of 2009, she was earning in excess of $60,000 per year.  At work, Applicant\n13\nreceives commendable appraisals. She was recommended for, and received, a\ncompetitive certification appropriate to her field. Her supervisor fully recommends her\nfor a security clearance, noting her character and both her moral and ethical integrity.14\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n15\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n16\n17\n\n Id.\n      18\n Id.\n      19\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      20\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      21\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n18\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n19\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n20\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.21\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nApplicant acquired a number of delinquent debts as she matriculated her way\nfrom undergraduate student to doctoral candidate. She admits a number of those debts\n\n Additionally, Applicant\u2019s claim that her student loans were accelerated for payment prematurely, prior to\n      22\nher graduation and despite her request for forbearance, is generally consistent with the federal government\nstudent loan program. \n6\nremain unaddressed. Such facts are sufficient to give rise to Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d)\nand FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply. With such\nconditions raised, the burden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case against her and\nmitigate security concerns. \nIn 2004, Applicant and her fiancee bought a foreclosure property at far below its\nvalue, but it turned into a \u201cmoney pit\u201d fixing the condition of the house and updating\nappliances. Moreover, payment on her student loans became due despite the fact she\nhad yet to finish her doctoral program. Additionally, their home took a protracted period\nof time to sell in a sour economy. Throughout this time, she and her husband tried to\noffset their debt through their paychecks and their real estate profits.  Financial\n22\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies. \nToday, approximately two-thirds of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt is paid or in\nrepayment. This includes her student loans, which were prematurely designated for\nrepayment despite her current student status and finances. They represent over half of\nher total debt. \nToday, the noble pursuit of higher education is a costly investment few can attain\nwithout acquiring significant debt. Here, Applicant\u2019s expedited doctoral pursuit was the\nmain reason she acquired her debt. Throughout her graduate studies, she and her\nhusband diligently tried to minimize their debts. Given the cost of higher education,\nhowever, debt was accepted as inevitable. With the exception of completing her\ndoctoral thesis, her formal education is now complete. She is now in a position to move\nahead and reap the benefits of her specialized training and diligent studies with a\nlucrative job. Meanwhile, her husband works full-time, adding to the family coffers.\nGiven these circumstances, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) applies. Moreover, based on Applicant\u2019s testimony, advice from financial\ncounselors and from the credit service have aided her in addressing some of her debts\nand in consolidating her student loans. Consequently, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) and FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d) both apply. No other mitigating conditions apply.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a young wife and mother who is uniquely goal oriented. At 17, she\nindependently commenced a self-financed educational path toward a doctoral degree.\nShe completed her undergraduate degree in only 5 semesters, then worked full-time\nwhile earning her master\u2019s degree. She and her husband toiled through her doctoral\nprogram with a singular goal of preparing her for a lucrative position in a highly\nspecialized field. Earmarks of her achievement include her recent attainment of her\n\u201cdream job\u201d and her ability to have kept her educational debt to far below the national\ncumulative average of $53,500 for undergraduate through doctoral matriculation. \nToday in that dream position, Applicant makes a lucrative salary augmented by\nher husband\u2019s own income. Together, they started addressing her delinquent debt\nbefore receipt of the December 2008 SOR. She arranged to have her student loans\nconsolidated for easier repayment, which she has already commenced. She solicited\nassistance from a debt counselor who has helped address some accounts through her\nbi-weekly payments to that entity. She received financial counseling advice and\nrecognizes she needs to continue with more formal debt counseling to help her address\nthe remainder of her delinquent accounts. Such proactive efforts are consistent with her\npast efforts, where she demonstrated ingenuity and diligence in her methods of\naddressing her academic debt. For example, she worked full-time to catch up on some\nof her undergraduate debt and help finance her master\u2019s degree. She also invested in a\ntownhouse in lieu of paying rent, leaving her able to sell that property for a profit when\nshe moved to begin her doctoral program. That profit was used to address the credit\ncard debt she had acquired during her master\u2019s program.  \n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).\n      23\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(3), (7).\n      24\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1).\n      25\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(9).\n      26\n8\nThe delinquent debt at issue is not the result of \u201cpoor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations\u201d nor does it serve as\nthe best commentary on her character traits, including her \u201creliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information.\u201d  She has not resorted to bankruptcy, has\n23\nexpressed the intent to honor her debts, none of her debts appear to be frivolous, and\nher lifestyle is not extravagant. The surrounding facts clearly show that this debt was\nincurred as, and calculated to be, a temporary measure to help finance her\nmatriculation in a specialized field.  There is no apparent potential for pressure,\n24\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress based on this debt. While the debt is high, the student\nloans are relatively modest for educational tracks leading to the doctoral level.  The\n25\nunaddressed debt, while high, is not disproportionate given her years of study and her\ncurrent field of practice. Having made good on her obligations in the past, there is little\nreason to believe she and her husband cannot again catch up on their most recent \u2013\nand final \u2013 round of educationally related obligations.  This is especially true given the\n26\nprogress made between her receipt of the SOR in late December 2008 through March\n2009 and her current pursuit of additional financial guidance. With security concerns\nregarding her finances mitigated, I conclude it is clearly consistent with national security\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nARTHUR E.

DOHA received the \nresponse on April 3, 2009, and Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May \nAugust 19, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n11, 2009. On May 13, 2009, the case was assigned to me. On May 14, 2009, DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for June 5, 2009.  The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant did not offer any exhibits at his hearing, but did testify on his \nown behalf. I held the record open until June 19, 2009 to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional evidence. Applicant timely submitted AE A through C, \nwhich were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. Applicant testified on his own behalf and I found his testimony to be \ncredible.  \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old senior secure systems engineer, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since August 2008. His current employer acquired \nthe intellectual property and staff of his previous employer where he had been \nemployed since August 2001. GE 1, Tr. 20-21. He is pursuing a security clearance to \nenhance his flexibility to work on different projects within his company, and to \n\u201ccontribute and serve my country.\u201d Tr. 12, 21-26.  \n \nApplicant graduated from a prestigious high school in June 1981, and went on to \nattend an equally prestigious university for one semester in the fall of 1981. He did not \npursue formal education beyond his one semester of college and described himself as \n\u201cessentially self-educated.\u201d Tr. 16-17. He learned his trade by \u201cexploring the system and \nthe functionality and learning about it by practicing.\u201d Tr. 17. He also worked as a \nresearch associate for seven years in the computer science department of the university \nhe attended for one semester. Tr. 17. \n \nApplicant is not married, but has been involved in an ongoing 22-year \nrelationship with the same woman, who is the mother of their two-year-old daughter. He \ndescribes this woman as his \u201cpartner,\u201d who is a university anthropology professor. Tr. \n15-16, 18.  \n \nApplicant has never been charged with any felony, firearms, or explosives \noffense. He has not been charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type, non-traffic-\nrelated offenses in the last seven years. In the last seven years, he has not had any \ndebts delinquent over 180 days, bankruptcy petitions, unpaid judgments, or unpaid \nliens. GE 1. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nThe underlying basis of Applicant\u2019s past drug involvement is derived from his \nself-disclosure and is not disputed. Summarized, his past drug use consists of: (1) from \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFebruary 2001 to December 2007, he used marijuana approximately 20 to 30 times; (2) \nin August 2001, he used ecstasy once; (3) until approximately August 1992, he used \nLSD five times; (4) and until approximately July 1997, he used mushrooms \napproximately four times. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.) Applicant\u2019s use of drugs \nessentially ended in the mid-1990s except for his most recent use of marijuana in \nDecember 2007. Tr. 27-29. He credibly and fully disclosed the surrounding \ncircumstances of past drug use. \n \n \nExcept for one occasion since his partner became pregnant with their daughter, \nApplicant has not used any form of drugs, \u201calthough opportunities have presented \nthemselves in the 18 months since that event.\u201d Tr. 28-29. Even before Applicant\u2019s \npartner became pregnant, his interest in using drugs diminished: \n \nAnd, as I have grown older, it\u2019s not something that is appealing or \ninteresting for me as it was when I was younger. And, in the last three \nyears, essentially, since the impending birth of my daughter, I would say \nthat I, you know, certainly during the period that my partner was pregnant, \nyou know, I also \u2013 and she was, you know, taking off from drinking, and \nsmoking, and things like that, as well, I followed. And, at that point, more \nor less, you know, the illegal drug usage which, at that point, was just \nmarijuana, was also something that I essentially, no longer did. Tr. 29-30. \n \nAdditionally, to comply with the requirements of a holding a security clearance, \nApplicant stated he does not now use drugs nor does he intend to use drugs in the \nfuture. Tr. 31-32. Since December 2007, he has declined all opportunities to smoke \nmarijuana or use illegal drugs, and \u201cha[s] no trouble doing so.\u201d Tr. 32.  \n \nAfter his hearing, Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement of intent, dated \nJune 5, 2009, to continue abstaining from any drug abuse or other illegal use of drugs \nboth presently and in the future, with the understanding that any drug violation will result \nin the automatic revocation of clearance. AE A. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe SOR cross-alleged his past drug use under Guideline E (personal conduct). \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a.) SOR \u00b6 2.b. alleged that Applicant intentionally failed to register for the \nSelective Service. Applicant stated his 18th birthday was in December 1981, and it was \naround that time he stopped attending his university. He added: \n \nAnd, it was a fairly emotional time for me. The college experience had not \ngone well. And, I was not sure what direction I wanted to take with my life. \nAt the time, I was also unhappy with the direction that the United States \nGovernment was going in. I was a much younger and, I would say, more \nna\u00efve individual 27 years ago than I am now. \n \nIt was a choice that I made not to register, based on my feelings at the \ntime. As I mentioned in my response, from most of my friends from high \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nschool and college, the decision to register or not register was the one \nwhere, quite effectively, if they didn\u2019t, they would not be eligible for any \nfinancial aid as students. As I was no longer a formal student, that was not \nan issue that came up for me. \n \nAnd, as a result, I would say that, you know, after having made this choice \nat age of 18, it was something that I didn\u2019t even think about or reflect upon \nat all after the age of 19, as my life continued. It wasn\u2019t something that I \nreally thought about. \n \nAs I got older and, you know, my opinions on perhaps what the \nappropriate choice would have been, you know, it reached the \u2013 I reached \nan age, I believe at 25, where they won\u2019t even accept your registration any \nmore, as you\u2019re no longer eligible, within the eligible age. So, there was \nreally no opportunity or possibility of rectifying that. \n \nIn some ways, I would say that, to some small degree, the process of \napplying for the security clearance is some way, you know, for me, \npersonally, it doesn\u2019t, as I said, provide a significant and meaningful \nbenefit, but it does increase my ability to serve my country. And so, in \nsome way, were I to be approved for a security clearance, that would \nallow me to, in some way, rectify that choice that I made as a young man. \nTr. 37-38. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer, co-workers, and partner are aware of the underlying basis \nof the security concerns in the SOR. Tr. 47-48. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is deceased, and his father is suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease and is living in an assisted living facility. Tr. 45. In addition to his full-time job, \nand his responsibilities to his family, Applicant also assists his brother in managing the \nownership of a family-owned building in a major metropolitan area. Tr. 45-46. \n \nA close friend of Applicant\u2019s father, who has known Applicant since 1997, \nsubmitted a reference letter on his behalf. She observed him \u201cgrow and evolve into the \ncapable and mature man he is now.\u201d She noted that she along with Applicant and his \nbrother are caring for his father. She also stated Applicant is a very trustworthy and \nresponsible person, and recommended him for a security clearance. AE B. \n \nTwo work-related employees of Applicant\u2019s company submitted reference letters. \nThe first was a senior secure systems engineer, and the second was a principle secure \nsystems engineer. They collectively noted Applicant\u2019s diligence as an employee and his \nfuture potential in the defense industry. They spoke very highly of him as an employee \nand of his moral character. They strongly recommend him for a security clearance. AE \nC, AE D.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines H (drug involvement) and E (personal conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline H through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the evidence presented. He fully disclosed his drug abuse in his \nResponse to SOR and at his hearing.  \n \n \nA review of the evidence supports application of two drug involvement \ndisqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 25(a): \u201cany drug abuse (see above definition);\u201d1 and AG \u00b6 \n25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, \nsale, or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of \ndrug involvement mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 26(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b): \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, \nsuch as: (1) disassociation form drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of \nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation.\u201d  \n \n1 AG \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medication direction. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d2 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies. Applicant\u2019s last drug use was December 2007, about 18 \nmonths before his hearing. His overall illegal drug use occurred primarily in his early \nyears and tapered off as he matured, and ceased altogether when he became a father. \nThe absence of evidence of more recent or extensive drug use, and his promise not to \nuse illegal drugs in the future eliminates doubts about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal drug use.3   \n   \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. With maturity and new found responsibilities of fatherhood, he \nhas broken or reduced the prevalence of his patterns of drug abuse, and he has \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board \nstated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n3In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nchanged his own life with respect to illegal drug use. He has abstained from drug abuse \nfor about 18 months and has no problem in doing so. AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies.  \n \nHis reference letters and statements from senior company representatives show \nApplicant\u2019s work behavior has not been indicative of his having a drug problem. He is \nviewed as a valuable employee, who is reliable, dependable, and professional. His \nvalue to the defense industry is supported by senior company officials, who know him \npersonally and professionally, and by his own credible testimony and evidence \npresented. At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that future drug abuse is \nincompatible with his future career and family plans, and manifested a steadfast \ncommitment to continue lifestyle changes consistent with total abstinence of marijuana \nor any other drugs.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nWith respect to the personal conduct concerns involving Applicant\u2019s past drug \nabuse and failure to register for the Selective Service, the pertinent disqualifying \nconditions are AG \u00b6 16(d)(3), a pattern of rule violations and AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which \nstates, \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding.\u201d Certainly, past drug abuse and failure to register for the Selective Service \nviolated the law in our society, and is conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it \nadversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing. \n \nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d \napplies to Applicant\u2019s past drug abuse and failure to register for the Selective Service. \nApplicant\u2019s employer, government representatives, friends and family are well aware of \nhis past. Applicant has taken the positive step of disclosure, eliminating any vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation or duress. I do not believe Applicant would compromise \nnational security to avoid public disclosure of these past missteps. Any personal \nconduct security concerns, pertaining to past drug abuse and failure to register for the \nSelective Service, are mitigated.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has been and is willing to maintain conduct expected of one entrusted \nwith a security clearance. His employer, friends, and family support him. He has a \nhistory of stable employment and a strong work ethic. This support and self-\nintrospection should ensure his continued success. Applicant demonstrated the correct \nattitude and commitment to remaining drug free. Considering his demeanor and \ntestimony, I believe Applicant has learned from his mistakes, and his questionable \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. In sum, I find Applicant has presented sufficient evidence \nof rehabilitation.  \n \nIn short, Applicant is living a lifestyle consistent with someone who wishes to \nremain drug free. He remains committed to his life partner and is embracing the \nresponsibilities and joy of fatherhood, and is a responsible and contributing member of \nsociety.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the law, as set forth \nin Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the \nwhole person factors\u201d4 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \n \n \n \n4See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On March 18, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 5, 2009, and, on May 12,\n2009, answered the SOR by admitting all five allegations raised (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e).\nApplicant requested a decision be made without a hearing. On July 2, 2009,\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) supported by six\nattached items. It set forth the government\u2019s case based on the SOR. In his argument,\nDepartment Counsel also moved that administrative notice be taken with respect to the\nSeptember 25, 2009\n\n Absent objection by Applicant, Department Counsel\u2019s motion is granted.\n1\n Applicant surrendered his expired Lebanese passport in 2007 and now travels on his U.S. passport.\n2\n2\ncountry of Lebanon, as presented by counsel\u2019s submission of 14 additional documents\nissued by the United States (U.S.) government.  Applicant received the FORM on July\n1\n23, 2009. He declined to submit any additional information in opposition to the FORM.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 17, 2009, for administrative determination.\nBased upon a review of the limited case file and exhibits presented, Applicant failed to\ncarry his burden and mitigate security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been\nemployed as a linguist by the same company since March 2008. Prior to his present\nemployment, he worked for a defense contractor providing linguistic support to the U.S.\nmilitary. His transition to this field followed a career in the private sector retail industry.\nApplicant was born in Lebanon, but became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2001. He is\ndivorced and no children are noted. He has a diploma in bookkeeping. \nAlthough Applicant chose an administrative determination, he offered few facts\nregarding his life, background, immigration, or family. His SF-86 notes that he married a\nU.S. citizen in the U.S. in 1995 and that he was widowed the following year. His work\nhistory in the U.S. is noted as dating back to 1999. The SF-86 cites to his 2001\nnaturalization and his second marriage in 2003, to a foreign national, which ended in\ndivorce in 2007. He remarried in April or June 2008, after completing his SF-86.\nApplicant did not designate himself on the security application as a dual citizen.2\nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens and residents of Lebanon. His 69-year-\nold mother is a widow. A long-term housewife, she has no affiliation with the\ngovernment of Lebanon. She and Applicant speak by telephone every two to three\nweeks. His sister is 51 years of age. She used to own a clothing store, but is presently\nnot employed. While Applicant notes she has no affiliation with the government of\nLebanon, there is no indication as to her marital status or her associates. He speaks\nwith her by telephone monthly. Applicant\u2019s 46-year-old brother is a dual citizen of\nLebanon and Canada, currently residing in Saudi Arabia. He has no affiliation with any\nforeign government. Applicant speaks with his brother every two to three weeks and\nalso communicates with him via the internet. Applicant visited his brother\u2019s daughter,\nwho lives in Canada, in 2008. They speak once a month by telephone. Her husband is\na Lebanese citizen. He works for a hotel and is not affiliated with a foreign government.\nApplicant\u2019s contact with him is minimal.\nApplicant\u2019s current wife is 42 years of age. She is a citizen of Lebanon who\nresides in Canada and works as a restaurant cashier. Currently seeking refugee status,\nshe is prohibited from leaving Canada until all of her papers are processed. She is not\naffiliated with a foreign government. Applicant speaks with her by telephone two to\nthree times a day. They vacationed together in the late spring or summer of 2008,\n\n Letter, Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer, dated May 10, 2009.\n3\n FORM at 7 and appendix (U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Lebanon, Sep. 10, 2008, at 1,\n4\nconcerning non-government sanctioned activities within Lebanon and efforts to undermine both Lebanon\u2019s\nsovereignty and security.

The record does not indicate any other contact\nbetween the two. His wife has a large family and many cousins who are Lebanese, but\nApplicant does not know anything about them. His wife\u2019s sister is a Lebanese citizen\nawaiting dual-citizenship with Canada. She is a housewife residing in Canada with her\nhusband, a security guard. Applicant has no idea whether his sister-in-law or her\nhusband have any affiliations with a foreign government.\nLacking health insurance in the U.S., Applicant visited Lebanon from October\n2001 through January 2002 for knee surgery. He recuperated under his mother\u2019s care.\nHe returned the favor by visiting his mother between August 2004 and January 2005,\nwhen she was recovering from an illness. He neither initiated nor maintained any other\nsocial or business contacts while abroad. He was not questioned about his work. He\nhas had no adverse contacts with law enforcement or customs on any foreign trip.\nThere is no evidence that he was harassed, threatened, or approached by either\ngovernment affiliates or members of anti-government factions while abroad. He does\nnot believe that he is vulnerable to duress due to his foreign contacts or relations, nor\ndoes he believe his family would ever place him in a position in which he would be\nforced to choose between the U.S. and any faction or individuals. He is \u201cproud to be a\nUnited States citizen . . . willing to serve this great country for the cause of freedom.\u201d3\nIn September 2008, a travel warning was issued by the U.S. Department of State\nconcerning Lebanon, a parliamentary republic with which the U.S. seeks to maintain its\ntraditionally close ties and whose independence, sovereignty, national unity, and\nterritorial integrity the U.S. seeks to support. Lebanon has a constitution that affords its\ncitizens many rights. The warning, however, alerts American citizens to \u201csecurity threats\nand ongoing political violence in Lebanon\u201d and \u201cthe threat of anti-Western terrorist\nactivity\u201d that exists in Lebanon.  An April 2009 travel warning urges Americans to avoid\n4\nall travel to Lebanon due to on-going political violence.  U.S. government personnel\n5\nworking in Lebanon are required to live and work under strict security restrictions.  That\n6\nsame advisory warns of terrorist activity threats due to the presence of Al-Qaeda and\nJune al-Sham, as well as recent exercises of violence by Hizballah, a Lebanon-based\nterrorist group with an international presence. Finally, there is evidence that terrorists\nbased in Lebanon have attempted to acquire sensitive U.S. industrial products. In\nFebruary 2006, a dual citizen of Lebanon and Canada, who supported Hizballah, was\nfound guilty of conspiring to export sensitive military equipment from the U.S. to\nHizballah factions through a Canadian import/export shipping company.  A similar\n7\n\n Department of Justice News Release, Michigan Man Pleads Guilty to Supporting Hizballah, dated Nov. 29,\n8\n2007.\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n11\n4\nattempt was uncovered in 2007 when a U.S. citizen attempted to transfer products\nmanufactured by a U.S. defense contractor to an agent of Hizbollah in Lebanon.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and commonsense decision. Under to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n9\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n10\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n11\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\n\n Id.\n12\n Id.\n13\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n14\n5\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n13\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n14\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, the following guideline from\nAG \u00b6 6 is the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence. The Concern: The concern under this\nadjudicative guideline is that foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nthe individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is\nnot in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nThe adjudication can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those that would mitigate security\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the analysis below.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is seeking a security clearance as part of his employment with a U.S.\ndefense contractor, where he works as a linguist and cultural advisor. Applicant\u2019s\nmother and sister are citizens and residents of Lebanon, a foreign country posing\nsecurity concerns due to on-going political violence, the presence of terrorist forces\nwhose interests are antithetical to those of the U.S., and recent activity by terrorist\nforces within that country to gain access to sensitive industrial materials. Additionally,\n\n6\nhis brother is a dual-national of Lebanon and Canada, currently residing in Saudi\nArabia. Applicant\u2019s wife is a Lebanese citizen currently seeking refugee status in\nCanada. Further, his niece and Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law maintain connections with\nLebanon. Such facts give rise to Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG\n\u00b6 7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information\u201d). With disqualifying conditions thus raised, the\nburden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security concerns. \nHere, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8(a) requires that\ncircumstances make it unlikely that an applicant will be required to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, groups, organizations, or government and the interests\nof the U.S. In his materials, Applicant states that this is the case. In choosing an\nadministrative determination, however, he limited his input to his written submissions.\nThose documents fail to describe what circumstances would make such a choice\nunlikely. Consequently, this FI MC cannot apply. \nApplicant described the frequency of his contact with his family members. No\nfacts were offered to help depict the depth of his relationships with his family members.\nThe lone exceptions are the fact he recently remarried and the fact he and his mother\nhelped each other recuperate during periods of medical need. Moreover, although\nApplicant does note his pride in being a U.S. citizen and his willingness to serve this\nnation, he offered no information regarding his ties to his community or his commitment\nto his current residence and situation. While there are no allegations questioning\nApplicant\u2019s loyalty or his sincerity in wishing to serve the U.S., he presented insufficient\nevidence upon which to judge whether AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d) or AG \u00b6 8(c) (\u201ccontact or communication\nwith foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d) applies. No other FI MC applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\n\n Id.\n15\n7\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Here, little is known about the Applicant\u2019s life before his 2001\nnaturalization. Today, he is a mature, educated man with linguistic skills that are unique\nand highly sought within the defense community. While there is no evidence his family\nmembers are affiliated with a foreign government, there is similarly no evidence that\nthey are immune from the sway of terrorist forces based in or around Lebanon. The\nscant evidence introduced by Applicant attempts to refute the foreign influence security\nconcerns raised, but it is insufficient to mitigate those concerns. \nIn choosing an administrative determination, an applicant binds the\nadministrative judge exclusively to the information introduced into the official record.\nQuestions cannot be posed that might resolve lingering concerns. Consequently, an\napplicant\u2019s submissions must anticipate all the information needed for a full\nconsideration of whether any mitigating conditions apply. Otherwise, an applicant risks\nfailing to meet the burden placed squarely on those seeking access to privileged\ninformation. \nHere, Applicant\u2019s statements may paint a picture of his family members and his\ninteraction with them. That picture, however, lacks depth and detail. While there is no\nbasis to doubt Applicant\u2019s honesty or sincerity, the ultimate burden remains on\nApplicant to mitigate foreign influence security concerns. His submissions failed to carry\nthat burden. As noted above, any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\ninformation.  Consequently, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with national\n15\nsecurity to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn January 15, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines K and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 5, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 19, 2009. I convened the hearing as \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nscheduled on June 11, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on June 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 74 years old. He is a graduate of a service academy and served on \nactive duty for ten years before being honorably discharged. He has held a security \nclearance for more than fifty years. After leaving the service, he worked for the federal \ngovernment from 1967 to 1993, when he retired. He did volunteer work for \napproximately a year before he returned to work part-time as a senior engineer for a \nfederal contractor in 1994, and later that year began working full-time until 2007. He \nagreed to assume a six-week project that he had a particular expertise in before retiring. \nHe had planned on retiring in January or February 2007, because a year prior his wife \nhad become serious ill and needed care. Applicant and his wife were married in 1967. \nHe had three children from a previous marriage and she had one child from a previous \nmarriage; together they had a son.1  \n \n \nIn the later part of February 2007, Applicant also had medical problems and \nneeded specialized treatment. The day after his treatment, his wife was hospitalized. \nApplicant was anxious to finish the project he was working on so he could devote \nhimself to the full-time care of his wife. He described himself as being in \u201cemotional \nturmoil\u201d from the stressors of his medical problems and his wife\u2019s deteriorating \ncondition. She had been experiencing health problems for over twenty years with \nvarying degrees of incapacitation.2  \n \n \nApplicant was under pressure to complete the project and was waiting for a \nparticular document he needed. He was never advised that the document, addressed to \nhim, had arrived at his company two weeks earlier. The document was confidential and \nthe internal policy of the company was that it required a classification receipt. This was \na more stringent requirement than what the National Industrial Security Program \nOperating Manual (NISPOM) required. The company that sent the document, \nApplicant\u2019s client, was unaware of Applicant\u2019s company\u2019s new requirement and did not \nsend it following the more stringent requirement. Delivery of the document to Applicant \nwas delayed while the two companies resolved the issue of the classification receipt. In \nthe meantime, Applicant was frustrated when he learned the document that he \n \n1 Tr. 9, 23-26, 50-58. \n \n2 Tr. 19-22, 58-60. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ndesperately needed to complete his project was held by his company, and he was not \ntold it had arrived two weeks prior.3  \n \nOn March 12, 2007, when Applicant learned the document was at his company, \nhe requested it so he could complete the project. When Applicant received the \ndocument, he took it home so he could complete the project while caring for his wife. He \nwas authorized to work from home, but not to take the document home. He did not \nrequest permission from a supervisor to take the document home. He knew the \ndocument was confidential and it violated the rules and procedures for handling \nconfidential material. An inventory was completed of Applicant\u2019s office safe the next day \nand it was determined the document was missing. Applicant was contacted and \nadmitted the document was in his possession at home. He secured it in an unauthorized \nsafe at his home. He did not follow proper procedures for carrying and transporting the \nconfidential document.4  \n \nApplicant admitted he violated company policy and procedure. He admitted he \nwas frustrated and acted inappropriately. When he was contacted at home by the \nSecurity Manager, Applicant admitted he had the document. He stated he would return \nthe document, but he needed to care for his wife. Applicant admitted he was displeased \nwith the Security Manager for not originally advising him that the document, he had \nbeen anxious waiting for to complete the project, was at their company for two weeks \nbefore he was told. He was frustrated that the delay was due to a rule that was not \nrequired by the NISPOM. The Security Manager was concerned about the document so \nshe and another person went to his house to retrieve it. He handed the document to \nher. It was not wrapped properly, but she brought the appropriate material to wrap it.5  \n \nApplicant does not dispute what he did was wrong. He understands he handled \nthe situation wrong. He stated: \n \nI knew that my action was wrong. I knew, also, that since my wife was \nincapacitated and never came into my room, where I was working, that no \none, other than me, was going to see the document. Although I \nunderstand fully that I broke the rules and that I was putting it at risk.6 \n \nApplicant does not think he is above the rules and regrets his actions. He \nunderstands his need to follow the rules, even though he disagrees with the additional \npolicy imposed by his company. He readily admitted he was overwhelmed with the \ndeteriorating situation about his wife and was under a great deal of pressure to \ncomplete the project. The delay in receiving the document added to the pressure. He \n \n3 Tr. 27, 44-50. \n \n4 Tr. 36-38, 60-62; GE 4. \n \n5 Tr. 35-50, 66-76; GE 4. \n \n6 Tr. 30-31. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nsincerely regrets his actions. He credibly testified that he has never done something like \nthis in the past and he will never do something like this again.7  \n \nApplicant did complete the project. He was given a letter of warning for his \nactions. There is no evidence that the confidential document was compromised, but it \nwas in his home with his wife. No evidence was presented that there were other \nclassified documents at his residence. He has had no other security related issues since \nthis incident.8   \n \nApplicant explained he married his wife in 1967 and they had experienced the \nloss of two adult children. In his answer to the SOR he stated:  \n \nI was under extreme and unique pressures when the incident under \nreview occurred. I suspect it is difficult for anyone who has not lost a \nspouse after a long marriage (exacerbated by the prior death of two of our \nchildren) to appreciate the emotional turmoil involved in such a situation.9 \n \nA senior executive service coworker of Applicant provided a letter stating that he \nhas worked with him since 1983 and stated he \u201csaw no relaxation of good classified \ndocument control and handling in a multitude of meetings, conferences and one-on-one \nsituations\u201d He also commented that he has no doubt as to the high character and moral \nstandards of Applicant in both work and social environments and would and has trusted \nhim with keeping our nation\u2019s classified information safe from those not authorized.10 \n \n \nA former supervisor for whom Applicant worked for five years and maintained \ncontact with for the past ten years also provided a character letter. He described \nApplicant as a meticulous, thorough, and dedicated public servant who served \nhonorably and admirably in his specific area of expertise. He believed Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity violation was completely out of character. He still would trust him even knowing \nhe made a mistake.11 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s son also provided a letter. He described his father as a person who \npossesses integrity, honor and selflessness. He stated his father sacrificed almost all of \nhis time with his family to devote himself to his country, serving it for 56 years. He was \nroutinely recognized for exceptional and faithful service. He further explained that when \nhis mother fell ill, his father was consumed by concerns for her welfare and her \nimmediate medical care. He also was concerned about completing a project on time. \nHis son noted that it was his father\u2019s dedication to completing an assigned task, while \n \n7 Tr. 30-33, 66-70. \n \n8 Tr. 34-37; GE 4. \n \n9 Tr. 24, 27-28; Answer to SOR. \n \n10 AE A. \n \n11 AE B. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nattentiveness.\u201d  \n \nPolicies \nh are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nnd has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \non as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n                                                          \nbeing by his wife\u2019s side that resulted in his decision to bring the needed document \nhome. He described his father as tormented by his \u201csingle instance of \n12\nin\n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, whic\n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likew\n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201dThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel a\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolati\n \n12 AE C. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected \ninformation: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n \n \n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \nin any other unauthorized location; and \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nAppellant admitted he took a confidential document home with him because he \nneeded to complete a project. It was not properly stored or wrapped. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline \nunder AG \u00b6 35. Specifically, I considered the following:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual currently reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, and  \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that in March 2007 he took a confidential document home \nwith him out of frustration and pressure to complete a project. His actions were \ninfluenced by his need to care for his wife due to her deteriorating health. Applicant has \nhad a security clearance for more than fifty years without incident. He is truly remorseful \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor his inappropriate conduct. He understands what he did was wrong. There is no \nevidence that the confidential document was compromised. I find these are unique facts \nand circumstances and are very unlikely to happen again. Applicant has served his \ncountry for more than a half of a century without a blemish. He accepts responsibility for \nhis action. He was counseled and is committed to ensuring that a similar incident does \nnot recur. I find both mitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n \n(c) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to considerations of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nAfter careful consideration of all of the evidence, I conclude there is no additional \nadverse information outside of the evidence presented regarding the security infraction \nthat has been alleged, which requires a separate finding or analysis under the Personal \nConduct Guideline. I will consider all of the evidence presented when analyzing the \nwhole person. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country as both \na military officer and later while working for the Defense Department, and then as a \ndefense contractor. He has served long and honorably. He was going through a very \ndifficult time in his life as his wife\u2019s health was deteriorating and she needed full time \ncare. He also had his own medical problems. The pressure of being under a deadline to \ncomplete a project and frustration of finding out the document was sitting at his \ncompany for two weeks caused him to make a poor decision. He regrets his actions. I \nhave considered his entire background and record. It is undeniable he violated the \nrules. However, this was a one time aberration in an otherwise stellar career. I find \nApplicant is not a security risk and that he is unlikely to make the same mistake in the \nfuture. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from Handling Protected \nInformation and Personal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Single and without children, he holds a B.S. in computer science. Applicant was introduced to marijuana in high school.

In 2005 he left the firm under cordial terms. For several months in 2005, he hiked the Appalachian Trail along with some friends. During the evenings the hikers smoked marijuana. Applicant himself used marijuana with them between 10 and 15 times. After completing the hike, he maintained some contact with his companions, though he has had no personal contact with them since changing states of residence in January 2008. Applicant admitted his marijuana use on his security clearance application (SCA). When asked about this use in an interview, he stated that he was still using marijuana.

Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge failed to consider record\nevidence submitted by Applicant; whether the Judge mis-weighed the evidence; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no\nerror, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a software developer\nfor a Defense contractor.  Single and without children, he holds a B.S. in computer science.  \nApplicant was introduced to marijuana in high school.  Between 1999 and 2001 he smoked\nmarijuana three to five times a month, mainly in social settings.  After college he worked as a\nconsultant for an accounting firm.  In 2005 he left the firm under cordial terms.  For several months\nin 2005, he hiked the Appalachian Trail along with some friends.  During the evenings the hikers\nsmoked marijuana.  Applicant himself used marijuana with them between 10 and 15 times.  After\ncompleting the hike, he maintained some contact with his companions, though he has had no\npersonal contact with them since changing states of residence in January 2008. \nApplicant admitted his marijuana use on his security clearance application (SCA).  When\nasked about this use in an interview, he stated that he was still using marijuana.  When advised of\nthe possible consequence this posed to his clearance, he stated that he would stop immediately.   \nApplicant has shared a household with others during the year preceding the close of the\nrecord.  One of the roommates keeps marijuana in the household, for medical purposes.  The\nroommate had an authorization from the state to possess the marijuana.  Applicant stated, in a post\nhearing submission, that he would be vacating the apartment in August following the hearing.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for reliability and trustworthiness.  Applicant has\nnot used marijuana, at least since October 2008.   \n1\n\n\u201cApplicant used marijuana intermittently in social situations (between 20 or 30 times altogether) with friends\n2\nbefore permanently discontinuing his use in July 2008.  His admissions to using marijuana after applying for a security\nclearance do raise initial security concerns[.]\u201d Id. at 7.  \nGE 2 states that the interview with Applicant was conducted on July 19, 2008.  GE 1, the SCA, demonstrates\n3\nthat Applicant signed the SCA on May 15, 2008.  \n3\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s statements concerning the date at which Applicant ceased\nusing marijuana, specifically the reference in the Analysis portion of the decision to Applicant\u2019s\n\u201cadmissions\u201d of marijuana use after having completed his SCA.   The Board has examined the\n2\nJudge\u2019s statement in light of the record evidence.  Government Exhibit (GE) 2 consists of\nApplicant\u2019s answers to interrogatories.  It includes a summary of the interview to which the Judge\nrefers.  The document also includes two questions, one inquiring as to the accuracy of the interview\nsummary and another inquiring if Applicant agreed with the summary.  He answered \u201cyes\u201d to both\nquestions.  In this interview, Applicant is presented as stating that, as of the date of the interview,\nhe was still using marijuana.   The interview occurred after the date Applicant signed his SCA.\n3\nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s description of this interview is accurate.  The Judge also stated that\nApplicant made a further admission of July 2008 marijuana use during his testimony at the hearing.\nA review of the transcript reveals that this attribution is not correct.  However, it does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge\u2019s use of the plural \u201cadmissions\u201d was error.  At worst, the Judge\u2019s\nerroneous characterization of Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony is harmless.  See ISCR No. 01-23362\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-\n11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002) for definition of harmless error.  The Board concludes that the\nJudge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by substantial record evidence.  See\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might\naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record\u201d).\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not weigh the record evidence properly and/or that he\nignored record evidence pertaining to Applicant\u2019s roommate\u2019s possession of marijuana.  For\nexample, Applicant states that the Judge did not give proper consideration to a post-hearing\ndocument in which he promised to move out of his apartment in August 2009.  A Judge is presumed\nto have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  In this case, the Judge\nacknowledged Applicant\u2019s plans to change his living arrangement in the near future.  He stated that\nthese plans have some mitigating significance.  However, he also noted that, at the close of the\nrecord, Applicant was still living with a person who possessed marijuana and that this posed a risk\nof temptation for continued use.  The Judge\u2019s treatment of Applicant\u2019s living arrangement is a\nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\nignored record evidence or that he weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\n\n4\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision\nat 10.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with\nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or\ndeny Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of two exhibits and a report on marijuana produced by the U.S. Drug\nEnforcement Administration, for which official notice was taken.  Applicant, in turn, relied\nSeptember 10, 2009\n\n2\non one witness (himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 6,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with information concerning his state\u2019s legalization of marijuana for medicinal\npurposes.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to July 6, 2009, to\nprovide supplemental documentation. The Government was afforded an equal amount\nof time, to July 15, 2009, to respond to Applicant\u2019s submissions.  Within the time\npermitted, Applicant provided post-hearing documentation of his state\u2019s medicinal\nmarijuana law (entitled the Compassionate Use Act, C Health & Safety Code, \u00b6 11362.5\n(2005)), along with legislative citations to laws banning unauthorized marijuana use and\npossession and guidelines adopted by major cities in the state.\nDepartment Counsel objected to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions covering\nmedical marijuana use in his state as irrelevant, and cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nin United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers and Jeffrey Jones, 532 U.S. 483 (2001)\nas controlling on the issue.\nAfter a thorough consideration of Applicant\u2019s legal submission concerning his\nstate\u2019s legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes only, and the Government\u2019s\ninterposed objection to its admissibility, Department Counsel\u2019s admission exception is\noverruled.  Oakland Cannabis Buyers, supra, has limited application to Applicant\u2019s\nmarijuana for medicinal purposes state exception.  This decision held that the federally\nmandated Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. \u00b6\u00b6 801 et seq.) that bars the\nmanufacture, distribution, and possession of various drugs, including marijuana, has no\nmedical benefits worthy of any exception outside of the narrow confines of government-\napproved research. Without any sustainable marijuana medical exception to employ,\nthe Supreme Court used its federal jurisdictional authority to preserve the reach of the\nCSA over illegal drug manufacturing, distributing, and possession. \nOakland Cannabis Buyers did not attempt to invalidate the enabling legislation\nadopted by the state of Applicant\u2019s domicile. This legislation was designed to implement\nthe key enabling provisions of Proposition 215, under \u00b6\u00b6 11362.5 et seq.  Proposition\n215 (known as the Compassionate Use Act) was passed by the state\u2019s voters in 1996 to\nvalidate the right of residents of the state to possess and use marijuana for medical\npurposes, when they have a recommendation from a licensed physician.  Proposition\n215 gives the patient\u2019s primary caregiver the right to cultivate and possess marijuana for\nthe patient.  But the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Court did affirm continued Federal\njurisdiction over drug violators covered by the law without regard to the state\u2019s\nmarijuana exception. \n More recently, the Supreme Court seized  the opportunity to refine and clarify\nthe reach of its holding in Oakland Cannabis Buyers, supra.  In Raich v. Gonzales, 545\n\n3\nU.S. 1, 8-14 (2005), the Court addressed the claims of two state residents who suffered\nfrom a variety of serious medical conditions and has sought to avail themselves of\nmedical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the state\u2019s Compassionate Use Act.\nNotwithstanding that county investigating officials had found that one respondent\u2019s\nmedical use of marijuana was entirely lawful, federal agents seized and destroyed all six\nof her cannabis plants. \nIn Raich v. Gonzales, supra, the Supreme Court held that the regulation of\nmarijuana under the CSA was fully within Congress\u2019 commerce power (U.S. Const., art.\nI, \u00b6 8), because marijuana production intended for home production could have a\nsubstantial effect on supply and demand in the national market. The Raich Court\nreasoned that federal failure to regulate the intrastate manufacturing and possession of\nmarijuana would leave a considerable gap in the CSA.  In turn, the Court vacated the\nNinth Circuit\u2019 s judgment. \nSo, even if Applicant\u2019s current roommate had a state-approved permit to use\nmarijuana for medicinal purposes, his permit would not foreclose the Federal\nGovernment from prosecuting illegal possession charges under the CSA.  His friend, as\nsuch, has no exemption from federal drug possession charges, just because he had a\nmarijuana use exception from the state. \nTo the extent Applicant\u2019s submission is intended only to validate medicinal\nmarijuana use of excepted quantities under the state\u2019s Compassionate Use Act, his\nstate\u2019s medically-based marijuana exception retains some relevance to his claims that\nhe no longer associates with persons who use marijuana illegally under state law.  It\nhas no relevance, though, to federally-based marijuana possession violations.\nApplicant\u2019s e-mail submission is accepted for the limited purpose of establishing a state-\nbased marijuana exception, and is admitted as exhibit C.  \nApplicant\u2019s other post-hearing submission consisted of e-mails covering his\nstated intention to vacate his current residence and move into an apartment with his\ngirlfriend, with the stated hope of demonstrating he will no longer be associating with\ndrug-using associates and contacts.  He qualified his intentions with an updated e-mail\nthat provided an August 1 target date for vacating his current residence.  Department\nCounsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s submissions, but noted that he was still residing\nwith the same roommate as of the date of closing of the record.  Applicant\u2019s e-mailed\nsubmissions will be included as Applicant\u2019s exhibit D.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges Applicant (a) used marijuana with varying\nfrequency from 1999 to at least July 2008 and (b) continued to use marijuana after he\nhad completed a security clearance application (SF-86) in May 2008. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s continued use of marijuana\nafter he completed his security clearance application constituted conduct involving\n\n4\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations that can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he used marijuana, with varying\nfrequency, from about 1999 to at least July 2008, but confined his marijuana use to\noccasional social situations with friends.  He admitted, too, continuing his use of\nmarijuana after he completed his security clearance application, but ceased using the\nsubstance after being advised by an interviewing investigator in June 2008 that his\ncontinued use could endanger his getting a security clearance.  Applicant claimed he\ndoes not intend to abuse any drugs in the future, including marijuana, and agreed to an\nautomatic revocation of his clearance for any violation.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 27-year-old software developer for a defense contractor who seeks\nto retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is single and has no children.  He attended an accredited university\nbetween 2001 and 2005 and was awarded a bachelor of science degree in computer\nscience in June 2005 (see ex. 1).  Following his graduation, he worked as a consultant\nfor two years for an accredited public accounting firm (Tr., at 38).\nApplicant was introduced to marijuana in high school.  Between 1999 and 2001,\nhe smoked the substance (mainly with a pipe) three to five times a month in social\nsituations (see ex. 2; Tr., at 26, 31).  In college, he used marijuana five to 10 times (Tr.,\nat 41-43), but abstained from using the substance during his two-year employment term\nwith his consulting firm.\nApplicant left his consulting firm on good terms in June 2007 to join several\nfriends on an Appalachian Trail hiking journey (Tr., at 40).  When hiking on the Trail\n(between July and December 2007), Applicant and his friends spent their nights in\ncabins or shelters (Tr., at 34).  In the evenings, they often passed marijuana around\nbetween themselves. Some of his friends on the Trail smoked marijuana on a regular\nbasis (i.e., daily)(Tr., at 34, 43).  Applicant, though, generally resisted marijuana offers\nfrom his Trail friends.  He estimates to have used the substance between 10 and 15\ntimes in all during his six months on the Trail (Tr., at 26, 34, 37).  He attributes his\nlimited use to peer pressure (Tr., at 34).\nAfter completing his Appalachian Trail adventure, Applicant maintained\nintermittent contact with his Trail friends.  He continued to maintain his contacts after his\nrelocation to his current state of residence in January 2008 (Tr., at 28).  He assures he\nhas had no personal contact with these friends since his relocation (R.T., at 45).\n\n5\nBetween January and July of 2008, Applicant used marijuana two to three times\nin social situations with his housemates (Tr., at 26).  Applicant generally refused any\nmarijuana at these parties (Tr., at 28-31).  \nIn the security clearance application (e-QIP) he completed in May 2008,\nApplicant estimated that he used marijuana between 20 and 30 times between 1999\nand March 2008 (see ex. 1).  When asked about his marijuana use in a follow-up\ninterview with an investigator from the Office of Personal Management (OPM) in July\n2008, he told the investigator that \u201c[a]s of this date, he was still using marijuana \u201c (ex. 2).\nWhen informed of  the seriousness of his \u201chabit,\u201d he told the investigator \u201che needed his\njob and as of right now he will stop using marijuana\u201d (ex. 2).  At hearing, he reaffirmed\nhis e-QIP estimates and his last use of the drug in July 2008, citing the importance of\nhis job and the relationship he has since established with his girlfriend (Tr., at 26).\nApplicant assured that he never purchased marijuana or owned any drug paraphernalia.\nHis estimates are not challenged and are accepted.\nIn the household that Applicant shared with roommates over the past year,\nApplicant indicated that one of the roommates used marijuana for pain relief (Tr., at 45-\n46). This roommate kept his marijuana in his own room and did not use it in Applicant\u2019s\npresence (Tr., at 46).  Applicant did not say whether he had ever seen proof of his\nroommate\u2019s having a state-approved medical exception. Applicant\u2019s understanding of\nthe roommate\u2019s having authorization from state authorities to use marijuana is not\nchallenged, though, and his good-faith understanding of his roommate\u2019s marijuana\nclaims are worthy of acceptance (Tr., at 36, 46). \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend and her parents have all expressed disappointment with his\nusing marijuana in the past and with his sharing an apartment with an individual who\nuses marijuana, even for legal medicinal purposes (see ex. D). While Applicant\nmaintained that marijuana use for certified medicinal purposes is legal in his state, he\nassured in his post-hearing submission that he will be vacating his apartment (effective\nAugust 1, 2009), and moving in with his girlfriend (ex. D).   \nMarijuana, according to study by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\n(DEA), can have adverse short-term effects on body functioning and, if smoked\nregularly, can cause lasting damage to the user\u2019s short-term memory.  Marijuana\ndistribution is widespread in the U.S., according to the DEA Study, and is mainly\ncontrolled by criminal groups in Mexico and Asia.   The DEA mainly targets criminals\nengaged in cultivation and trafficking of marijuana (see id.).\nApplicant is well regarded by longstanding friends who wrote on his behalf (see\nex. B).  They uniformly characterize Applicant as reliable and trustworthy and unlikely to\nabuse illegal drugs in the future (see ex. B).  Applicant\u2019s current girlfriend is deeply\nimpressed with his honesty and trustworthiness (ex. B).  Early in their relationship, he\ntold her about his infrequent past use of marijuana in high school, on his Appalachian\nTrail hiking journey, and at a few parties in his current residence state (ex. B; Tr., at 35).\nWhile she does not approve of such conduct, she attests to her certainty that he has not\n\n6\nused marijuana since they began dating in October 2008, or even entertained the idea\nof smoking the substance.  Her statements corroborate Applicant\u2019s assurances, and are\nnot contradicted by any evidence in the record.  Her statements are credible and are\naccepted.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability \nand\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.  AG \u00b6 24.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\n\n7\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons; and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nOver a nine-year period (between 1999 and at least June 2008), Applicant used\nmarijuana intermittently in social situations (between 20 and 30 times altogether) with\nfriends before permanently discontinuing his use in July 2008.  His admissions to using\nmarijuana after applying for a security clearance do raise initial security concerns over\nrisks of recurrence, as well as  judgment issues.  On the strength of the evidence\npresented, several disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drug abuse\nare applicable: DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d  DC \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia,\u201d and DC \u00b6 25(h), \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or\nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\u201d\nJudgment concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s continued drug use after applying for a\nsecurity clearance in March 2007.  These actions reflect both judgment lapses and\ndisregard of the DoD\u2019s rules and policies for clearance holders.  Applicant\u2019s actions are\nexpressly covered by Guideline E, and are entitled to independent cognizance under this\nGuideline according to the Appeal Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-20964, at 6 (App. Bd.\nApril 10, 2008).  Where (as here) there is additional probative adverse information\ncovered by Guideline E that is not covered by Guideline H, and vice versa, and which\nreflects a recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally\nunstable behavior, independent grounds do exist for considering questionable judgment\nand trustworthiness allegations under Guideline E as well as Guideline H.  Authority for\n\n8\nconsidering overlapping conduct under both guidelines is contained in the guidance\nprovided in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) of the Directive\u2019s August 2006 amendments. \nSo, under Guideline E, core judgment and trustworthiness concerns covered by\nD.C. \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may\nnot properly safeguard protected information,\u201d have some applicability to this case.\nApplicant has made some noticeable gains in his efforts to mitigate his past\nmarijuana use.  While Applicant\u2019s acknowledged marijuana use covered a considerable\nperiod (almost nine years), his use was never frequent,  and it was generally limited to\nsocial situations after high school.  MC \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d is disjunctive and can be applied to Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicant\u2019s\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future has some application as well.\nAvailable considerations under \u00b6 26(b) include \u201c(3) an appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d\nand \u201c(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation.\u201d  \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s current living situation (which includes a roommate who\nuses marijuana for claimed medicinal purposes), MC \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from\ndrug-using associates and contacts,\u201d and MC \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used,\u201d have only limited application.  In fairness to\nApplicant, he has exhibited open candor about his past marijuana use and his\nassociations with persons who have used the substance.  His girlfriend, who has\nmaintained a close relationship with him for the past year, assures he has never used\nmarijuana in her presence, or anywhere else that she knows of. She earnestly\ncorroborates his expressed intentions never to use marijuana again, and is apparently\nwilling to partner his vacating his apartment and moving in with her (effective August 1,\n2009). \nApplicant\u2019s commitments to breaking all ties and connections with friends and\nassociates who use or are in any way involved with marijuana are encouraging. These\nadditional assurances and expressed changes in Applicant\u2019s living situation and lifestyle\nenable him to take partial advantage of MC \u00b6 26(b)(1) and (b)(2).\nStill, with the closing of the record, Applicant continues to reside in a residence\nwhere one of his roommates uses marijuana for claimed medicinal purposes.  Having a\nstate-approved medicinal exception would not absolve the roommate of exposure to the\npotential of federal prosecution (as unlikely as this might be).  Whether this roommate\neven has a certified medical need for the drug, or has inflated his reasons for his using\nmarijuana to allay any Applicant concerns, is less than clear.  And, more importantly, his\n\n9\nroommate\u2019s having a marijuana use exception would not reduce the seductive risk that\nstored marijuana in such close proximity might pose for Applicant. \n So, while Applicant\u2019s assurances that he has no intention of ever resuming his\nuse of marijuana, or any illegal substance, in the future, are entitled to considerable\nweight, they cannot be totally separated from the recurrence risks that face Applicant for\nso long as he continues to occupy his current residence. Changing his home\nenvironment is vital to safely managing his recurrence risks.  Applicant\u2019s living in the\nsame apartment unit in close proximity to the drug\u2019s sponsor only prolongs his exposure\nto recurrence. \nFurthermore, medicinal use of marijuana that might be legal under the laws of\nApplicant\u2019s state is not immune to federal prosecution for violation of the CSA under the\nfederal government\u2019s concurrent jurisdiction over manufacturing, distributing, and\npossessing illegal drugs.  By his continued residing in a  residence where marijuana is\nused, he remains privy to potential violations of the CSA.\nFor his candid acknowledgment of his current roommate\u2019s use of marijuana for\npain relief and his ensuing commitment to move in with his girlfriend (effective August 1,\n2009), Applicant is entitled to take some advantage of MC \u00b6 17(g), \u201cassociation with\npersons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do\nnot cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness\nto comply with rules and regulations,\u201d and MC \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged\nthe behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive\nsteps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d of the\nmitigating conditions in the personal conduct guideline.  \n Because of the recency of Applicant\u2019s discontinued use of marijuana (less than a\nyear) and his continued association with a person who uses marijuana (albeit for claimed\nmedicinal purposes), it is still too soon to conclude that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and\njudgment lapses associated with his continued use of the drug after he applied for a\nsecurity clearance are fully mitigated. More seasoning is necessary before safe\npredictive judgments can be made that Applicant will not resume his use of marijuana.   \nFrom the whole person perspective, Applicant has established independent\nprobative evidence of his overall honesty, trustworthiness, and understanding of DoD\npolicy constraints on the use of illegal substances. His positive endorsements from his\ncolleagues and girlfriend who are familiar with his past marijuana involvement reinforce\nhis discontinuance assurances. Still of some concern, though, are Applicant\u2019s continued\nuse of marijuana after completing his e-QIP, his expression of surprise when advised of\nthe seriousness of his continuing use by the OPM agent who interviewed him, and  the\nimplicit opening he left to resuming his use of marijuana should it not longer be an\nimpediment to his job.  In the context they were made, Applicant\u2019s extemporaneous\nstatements, while sincere, do raise questions about his motivating reasons for his\nwillingness to abruptly cease his marijuana use.  For example, was his decision the\n\n10\nresult of a mature reassessment of his need for marijuana in his life, or was it based on\nhis prioritizing of the importance of his job that requires a security clearance?  Because\nmotivation is never easy to objectively establish, the placement of reasonable time lines\non clearance applicants to test and absolve them of recurrence risks makes safe and\npractical sense when balancing the interests of protecting national security with the\ninterests of  those who seek access to the nation\u2019s secrets.  \nConsidering the record on a whole, at this time there is too little seasoning of\nApplicant\u2019s mitigation efforts to avert foreseeable risks of recurrent marijuana use.  While\nhe is to be commended on his decision to discontinue marijuana usage, it is still too early\nto make safe predictions about his ability to sustain his abstinence,  Taking into account\nall of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug use and judgment\nlapses, Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns related to his drug use and personal\nconduct issues.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered\nby Guidelines H and E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE H: (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):          AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubparas. 1.a and 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):         AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubpara. 2.a:\nAgainst  Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on February 27, 2008. On or before April 27, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct; Guideline M, Use of \nInformation Technology Systems; and Guideline D, Sexual Behavior. (The SOR was \nundated. The memorandum forwarding the SOR to Applicant is dated April 27, 2009, \nand is used to estimate the date when the SOR was issued.)  The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 26, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 15, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 24, 2009. On August 3, 2009, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued, scheduling the hearing for August 26, 2009. The case was heard on that \ndate. The government offered four exhibits which were admitted as Government \nOctober 15, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4. Applicant testified and submitted no documents.

He denies the remaining SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old software engineer for a Department of Defense \ncontractor who seeks to maintain his security clearance. He has been employed in his \ncurrent position since November 2007. He has held a security clearance since March \n2003. He is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. He is single \nand has two daughters, ages 17 and 10. (Tr at 5-6; Gov 1)  \n \nFrom August 2005 to March 2007, Applicant worked as a network technician for \nanother defense contractor located in another state. He applied for and was granted a \nsecurity clearance for the first time in this job. When he first started working for the \ndefense contractor, Applicant occasionally accessed the internet to use his personal e-\nmail accounts during work hours. He admits that he responded to e-mails from dating \nand adult sites that he had joined. He insists the adult sites did not contain pornography. \nHe also received SPAM e-mails that contained pornographic sites. A work computer \nscan revealed that Applicant had been accessing the internet for personal reasons. On \nSeptember 29, 2005, Applicant\u2019s supervisor verbally counseled him for unacceptable \ninternet use. The usage logs indicated Applicant used the internet for unacceptable \nreasons on September 18, 2005, September 28, 2005, and September 29, 2005. The \nspecific unacceptable reasons were not described. (Tr at 17-18, 33-41; Gov 4 at 2; \nResponse to SOR, dated May 26, 2009) \n \nOn June 20, 2006, Applicant received a warning letter for inappropriate internet \nuse. The letter does not provide the specific details of the unacceptable internet use \nother than Applicant was using customer-provided resources to access the internet for \npersonal use. The customer complained about Applicant\u2019s excessive and unacceptable \ninternet usage on February 15, 2006, May 1, 2006, and June 14, 2006.   The warning \nletter stated that Applicant violated the company\u2019s Network Systems Policies: PS-ISS-\n150 Acceptable Use Policy, Business Practice Council Guideline Use of Electronic \nCommunications, and Section 406 Performance Improvement Policy \u2013 Section 2, \nspecifically: \n \n2.21 Violating customer/contract compliance and business ethics policies. \n \n2.23 Engaging in conduct which causes embarrassment to the company \nor potentially disparages its image.  \n \n \nApplicant was warned that the excessive amount of time spent on the internet \nwas not warranted, and reflected negatively on his overall performance and the \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncompany. He was warned that future occurrences would result in further disciplinary \naction up to and including termination of employment. The warning letter was placed in \nApplicant\u2019s file for one year. During that time, he was not eligible to receive a merit \nincrease or to participate in recognition programs. (Gov 4) \n \n \nApplicant admits that he received this warning letter but denies the inappropriate \ninternet usage at work included accessing sites related to dating and pornography as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. He admits to accessing the internet while at work to check \nbasketball scores. Nothing in the record evidence indicates the basis for the warning \nletter was Applicant accessing web-sites for dating or pornography while at work. (Tr at \n18 \u2013 20, 41; Response to SOR, dated May 26, 2009)  \n \n \nOn March 21, 2007, Applicant was contacted by an investigator with the local \npolice department and asked to come in for questioning. He was questioned about \nsolicitation of a minor over his home computer in February 2007. Applicant denies any \nknowledge of soliciting a minor over the internet. During the time period in question, he \nallowed an acquaintance in his apartment complex to use his computer on occasion. \nThe computer was his personal lap top and was not a government computer.  On the \nday he was called in for questioning, the local police department obtained a search \nwarrant and seized Applicant\u2019s personal lap top, equipment, and several disks. After he \nwas questioned, Applicant was free to leave. He was not arrested or charged with any \noffense. (Tr at 21-23, 43-47; Gov 2; Gov 1, section 22; Gov 3; Response to SOR)  \n \n \nOn March 23, 2007, Applicant\u2019s manager called him on his day off.  His manager \ntold him that someone from the local police department contacted the office and told \nthem that Applicant was arrested on March 21, 2007, for soliciting a minor over the \ninternet. Applicant said he was willing to come in to work to discuss the matter. He told \nhis manager that he was called in for questioning by police but not arrested. He denied \nsoliciting a minor over the internet. Applicant was placed on administrative leave \nbecause the customer did not want publicity. On March 27, 2007, Applicant was asked \nto resign. He resigned because he believed that he had no choice but to resign or be \nfired. In April, the police department returned his computer and equipment to him. He \nwas never charged with an offense and never provided any documentation about the \nincident. (Tr at 24 \u2013 26, 47; Gov 2; Gov 3; Response to SOR)  \n \n \nFrom March 2007 to November 2007, Applicant was unemployed. He lost his \napartment and everything in it. He moved back to his home state and was hired by his \ncurrent employer in November 2007. On February 27, 2008, he completed his e-QIP \napplication. In response to section 22: Your Employment Record, Applicant indicated \nthat he left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct with regards \nto his previous employer. He provided a detailed explanation of the circumstances that \nled to his resignation. (Gov 1, Sec 22)   \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer without incident. Aside from when \nhe was called in for questioning in March 2007, he has had no other involvement with \nlaw enforcement. (Tr at 51)   \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are still required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThe following Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) potentially \napply to the facts of this case: \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person \nmay not properly safeguard protected information) \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is \nnot limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach \nof client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, or \nother inappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations); (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or \nresources) \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(c ) and \u00b6 16(d) apply with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  Applicant \nwas verbally counseled in September 2005 for unacceptable internet use by his \nemployer. He admits that he used his work computer for personal use and accessed \ndating  and adult web-sites during duty hours. He denies accessing pornographic web-\nsites but claims pornographic web-sites were sent as SPAM e-mail.  Although he was \nwarned to restrict his internet use at work for business purposes only, he received a \nwritten warning for inappropriate use of a business computer between February 2006 to \nJune 2006. The specifics describing the inappropriate use were not provided in the \nrecord evidence. Applicant admits to checking basketball scores while at work. He feels \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthat he was singled out because other co-workers were doing the same thing. There is \nno record evidence to support the premise that he accessed dating and pornographic \nweb-sites on these occasions.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b61.c is found for Applicant. There is no evidence Applicant used a \ngovernment computer while at the customer work site to solicit a minor over the internet \nas the allegation alleges. Applicant admits he was questioned by police about the use of \nhis home computer to solicit a minor over the internet while at home. He denies the \nallegation. He cooperated with law enforcement when called in for questioning. His \ncomputer, computer equipment, and computer disks were seized pursuant to a search \nwarrant. Nothing illicit was found on his computer or computer disks. He was not \narrested. Applicant claims he let an acquaintance in his apartment complex use his \ncomputer during the same timeframe that the alleged solicitation occurred. (Note: The \nfile contains no evidence pertaining to the alleged solicitation which was the basis for \ncalling in Applicant for questioning.) The record evidence contains no information from \nindependent sources or law enforcement that contradict Applicant\u2019s testimony. No \nwitnesses were called to establish the alleged offense. Applicant fully disclosed the \nincident when he completed his e-QIP application in February 2008.  In fact, he is the \nonly source in the record evidence describing this incident.  Being called in for \nquestioning does not mean an individual committed the offense. There is insufficient \nevidence to establish that Applicant solicited a minor over the internet on his home \ncomputer. \n \n \n \nA prima facie case is found with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. Applicant was \nquestioned by the local police department in March 2007 regarding accessing the \ninternet from his personal computer for the purposes of soliciting a minor. He was \nsubsequently placed on administrative leave and eventually asked to resign.  However, \nthe record evidence does not establish Applicant committed the offense that the police \nquestioned him about.  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised under personal conduct are mitigated. I find the \nfollowing Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c ) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17 (d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) \n \n \nWhile Applicant was counseled on two occasions for misuse of his work \ncomputer in 2005 and 2006, he has not repeated the conduct since that time. He has \nbeen employed since November 2007 with his current employer and has no issues \n\n \n7 \n \n \nregarding inappropriate use of his work computer. While Applicant was called in for \nquestioning about soliciting a minor on his personal computer, he was never arrested or \ncharged with a crime. He denies the allegation and there is no record evidence that \ncontradicts his testimony. In fact, all of the government\u2019s evidence consists of testimony \nprovided by Applicant. The allegations caused Applicant to lose his job. He resigned but \nfelt he had no alternative. The circumstances are such that it does not cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Considering all that Applicant has been \nthrough, he is unlikely to repeat such conduct.   \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information \nTechnology Systems is set out in AG \u00b6 39 which states,  \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply under Guideline M (M DC) in \nApplicant\u2019s case with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a, and 1.b: \n \n \nM DC \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem) \n \n \n \nWhile Applicant believes he was singled out for punishment for his second \noffense when he received the written warning letter, he admits that he violated company \npolicies pertaining to internet use while at work. The warning letter Applicant received \nstated the specific company policies Applicant violated pertaining to computer use. \n \n \n \nThe issues pertaining to Use of Information Technology Systems can be \nmitigated (M MC). M MC \u00b6 41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) applies to Applicant\u2019s case.  More than three years have passed since this \nincident. Since that time, Applicant has not been involved in any similar incidents. \nApplicant mitigated the Guideline M concern.  \n \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are not relevant to the Guideline M  \nallegation because they ultimately did not involve the use of a work computer and did \nnot occur in the work place.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the Sexual Behavior guideline is set forth in \n\u00b612 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  \n \n \nThe government did not establish its case with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c for the \nreasons discussed above under personal conduct. The government did not establish its \ncase with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.b because there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s \ninappropriate internet usage at work between February 2006 to June 2006 included \naccessing web-sites related to dating and pornography. Applicant admits to accessing \nadult and dating web-sites on his work computer when he was verbally counseled in \nSeptember 2005 which is the basis of SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n \n \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a, the following disqualifying condition is relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \n \n \nSexual Behavior Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public \nnature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment). Accessing adult sites at the \nworkplace indicates a lack of judgment on Applicant\u2019s part.   \n \n \nConcerns raised under Sexual Behavior can be mitigated. The following \nmitigating conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Sexual Behavior Mitigating \nCondition \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. More than four \nyears have passed since Applicant was warned about the inappropriate use of his work \ncomputer. There is no evidence that he used his work computer to access adult web-\nsites and pornography on the internet since September 2005.  The conduct was not \nrecent and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment.    \n \n \nApplicant mitigated the concerns raised under sexual behavior.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant was counseled by \nhis previous employer on two occasions for inappropriate use of company computers, \nspecifically for accessing the internet for personal reasons, he has not repeated such \nconduct in over three years. While he was questioned by police about soliciting a minor \non his personal computer, he denies the allegation. The government did not prove this \ncontroverted allegation by substantial evidence. Applicant was never arrested or \ncharged with any offense. Nothing illicit was found on his computer after it was seized \npursuant to a search warrant. While Applicant resigned when asked to do so after his \ncompany learned that he was questioned by police, he felt he had no alternative but to \nresign. He has successfully worked in his current position since November 2007. \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under Personal Conduct, Use of \nInformation Technology Systems, and Sexual Behavior.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.t) Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.l, but denied the other 18 allegations. In addition to the facts established through her admissions, and after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 31 years old. She has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2008. She served in the U.S. Army from October 1997 until December 2003. Applicant was administratively separated from the Army with an honorable discharge after her marital separation and pending divorce left her as a single parent with no options for child care should she be deployed away from home. Applicant and her husband met while both were serving in the Army. They were married in June 2000 and their divorce was finalized in October 2004. They have one child, who was born in 2002. Her ex-husband, who was physically and verbally abusive during their marriage, has never paid any child support. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 54) At the time of their separation, they were both assigned to an overseas Army post. When they separated in late 2003, and once Applicant was \u201cchaptered out\u201d of the military, she and their child returned to the United States. She left most of their marital assets, such as a car, furniture and appliances, with her ex-husband. From January 2004 until October 2005",

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a set of interrogatories  regarding information in her background.\n1\nBased on the results of the background investigation and her response to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request\n2\nAugust 21, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n3\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\n2\nfor access to classified information. On February 20, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on May 7, 2009. I convened a hearing on June 10, 2009, at which the\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 - 5),\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, proffered five exhibits (Ax. A -\nE), which were admitted without objection, and presented one witness. DOHA received\nthe transcript of hearing (Tr.) on June 30, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged Applicant owes approximately\n$50,107 for 20 delinquent or past due financial obligations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.t) Applicant\nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.l, but denied the other 18 allegations. In addition to the facts\nestablished through her admissions, and after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript,\nand exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 31 years old. She has been employed by a defense contractor since\nJanuary 2008. She served in the U.S. Army from October 1997 until December 2003.\nApplicant was administratively separated from the Army with an honorable discharge\nafter her marital separation and pending divorce left her as a single parent with no\noptions for child care should she be deployed away from home. Applicant and her\nhusband met while both were serving in the Army. They were married in June 2000 and\ntheir divorce was finalized in October 2004. They have one child, who was born in 2002.\nHer ex-husband, who was physically and verbally abusive during their marriage, has\nnever paid any child support. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. 54) \nAt the time of their separation, they were both assigned to an overseas Army\npost. When they separated in late 2003, and once Applicant was \u201cchaptered out\u201d of the\nmilitary, she and their child returned to the United States. She left most of their marital\nassets, such as a car, furniture and appliances, with her ex-husband. From January\n2004 until October 2005, Applicant worked in a variety of jobs before being hired as a\ncorrections officer. She worked in that job until January 2008, when a former Army\nsupervisor recruited her to join the company where she now works. That supervisor is\nnow her civilian supervisor. He regards Applicant as his best worker and speaks very\nhighly of her reliability, trustworthiness, and overall character. Several other co-workers\nand associates have echoed his sentiments and observations. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Ax. C; Tr.\n82 - 87)\nWhen Applicant was asked to complete her e-QIP in January 2008, she obtained\na copy of her credit report. She was surprised to see several delinquent and past due\naccounts attributed to her in the report. She listed all of them in response to financial\n\n3\nquestions in the e-QIP. Many of the debts were incurred with her ex-husband. Their\ndivorce decree ordered Applicant and her ex-husband to finalize an agreement about\nthe division of assets and liabilities. However, after they separated, he was deployed to\nIraq three times and was unavailable. He has since left the Army, but he is unemployed\nand has not made himself available to work this out. Applicant has been trying, since\nearly 2008, to resolve debts for which she is liable and/or to correct entries in her credit\nhistory that are not properly attributable to her. (Tr. 62 - 63) \nOf the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has established she is not liable for\nand/or is trying to resolve, the following:\n- SOR \u00b6 1.b (Ford Credit, $7,642): This debt is for a car financed in both her and\nher ex-husband\u2019s names. The car remained with him overseas when the\nmarriage ended and she has no information about what happened to it.\nNonetheless, she has been trying for more than a year to negotiate a settlement.\n(Tr. 41 - 42; Ax. A; Ax. D; Gx. 2)\n- SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d (two Sprint accounts totaling approximately $1,423):\nApplicant has never had a Sprint account. These debts have been deleted from\nher credit history. (Tr. 43 - 44; Ax. A; Ax. D; Gx. 2)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.f (Washington Gas Light, $825): Applicant has never had an account\nwith this creditor and the debt has been removed from her credit history. (Tr. 44 -\n45; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. D)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.g (University of Phoenix for #61): This is a debt for unpaid tuition for\non-line college courses Applicant took while assigned overseas. The account\nwas paid through Applicant\u2019s GI Bill benefits. The debt has been removed from\nher credit history. (Ax. A; Ax. D; Gx. 2; Tr. 46 - 48)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.h (Verizon, $242): Applicant had an account with this creditor, but she\nasserts it was paid. She has disputed the validity of this debt, which the creditor\nis not actively collecting, and it has been deleted from her credit history. (Tr. 48;\nGx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. D)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.i (AFNI-Bloom for $1,021): This is a collection account for a now-\ndefunct mobile phone carrier. Applicant brought her account current in 2007.\nBecause the company no longer exists, she has been unable to have the\naccount deleted from her credit history. (Gx. 2; Ax. B; Ax. D; Tr. 34 - 35, 48 - 49)\n- SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k (two AaronRents accounts totaling approximately $3,043):\nApplicant has never had an account with this creditor and the debts have been\nremoved from her credit history. (Tr. 34, 48 - 49; Ax. A; Ax. D)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.m (USA Discounters, $3,049): This debt is for furniture she and her\nex-husband financed. He retained the furniture at their overseas assignment\nwhen they separated. She does not know what happened to the furniture.\n\n4\nNonetheless, she has been trying to negotiate a settlement with this creditor. (Tr.\n35 - 36; Ax. A; Gx. 2)\n - SOR \u00b6 1.n (civil judgment in favor of Henderson Webb, Inc., for unpaid rent\ntotaling $756): Applicant never failed to pay rent while living in the apartment\ncomplex in question. She completed the full term of the lease before vacating the\napartment. The clerk\u2019s office at the courthouse where this judgment was entered\nnow says there is no record of any judgment against Applicant. This debt has\nbeen removed from her credit report. (Tr. 54 - 56; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. D; Gx. 2)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.o (Zenith Acquisition / ArcCertegy for $110): Applicant has been\nunable to find out what this debt is for and has received no information confirming\nthe debt is hers. (Tr. 58; Gx. 2; Ax. A)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.p (Beneficial / HFC for $7,022): This is a loan her ex-husband obtained\nusing both their names. It has been paid. It has been deleted from her credit\nhistory. (Tr. 58 - 59; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. D)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.q (NCO Med Clr for $447): This is a collection account for a medical\ndebt; however, even during two brief periods of unemployment after she left the\nArmy, Applicant has had medical insurance. This debt has been removed from\nher credit history. (Tr. 59 - 60; Ax. A; Ax. D)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.r (Pioneer ML GA for $3,305): This is another loan her ex-husband\nobtained using both their names. Applicant does not know if this debt has been\npaid. It has been deleted from her credit history. (Tr. 60; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. D)\n- SOR \u00b6 1.s (United Compuc for $170): Applicant does not remember what this\ndebt was for. It has been removed from her credit history. (Tr. 60; Gx. 2; Ax. A;\nAx. D)\nOf the remaining debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has acknowledged she is\nliable for them, but that she has either paid them or is working with the creditors to\nresolve them. Applicant disputes the amount of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a (Ashford at\nAtwood for $4,909). This is a debt for unpaid rent after Applicant broke her lease early\nto keep her ex-husband from finding her. Applicant insists she owes only about $1,400.\n(Tr. 37 - 40; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. E) The debt alleged in \u00b6 SOR 1.e (Woodland Grove for\n$6,010) is also for unpaid rent. Applicant co-signed a lease for her mother in 2007.\nHowever, her mother became unable to work and defaulted on the lease when she\nmoved out. Applicant has a settlement offer pending with the collection agency handling\nthe account. (Tr. 33, 44 - 46; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. E)\nThe debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.l (Toyota Mtr for $9,130) is the remainder after resale\nof a car Applicant had voluntarily repossessed. In 2006, she financed at a high interest\nrate the purchase of a used car for $16,000. After about a year, she realized she would\nnot be able to pay the note as agreed. She has been negotiating with the creditor to\nestablish a repayment plan for a lesser amount in satisfaction of the loan. (Tr. 51 - 53,\n79 - 80; Gx. 2) Finally, the debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.t (ROI for $642) is an unpaid medical\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n5\nbill for treatment she received at a hospital in the state where she was living before she\ntook her current job. Applicant has made arrangements to pay this debt. (Tr. 60 - 61;\nGx. 2; Gx. 5)\nApplicant\u2019s current finances are sound, as shown by a positive monthly cash flow\nof about $1,000 after expenses and debt payments. She has sent her child to live with\nher mother pending resolution of this matter. As a result, her current expenses include\nabout $700 she sends her mother to care for the child. However, Applicant has cut her\nmonthly rent by $450 and her food and other expenses by about $100 each month. (Tr.\n64 - 68) She is meeting all of her current obligations and is living well within her means;\nhowever, her ability to repay her debts sooner has been hampered by unexpected\nexpenses related to the deaths of two family members in 2008, two brief periods of\nunemployment, the costs of her divorce, and a November 2007 burglary in which she\nlost several personal belongings and about $1,100 with which she intended to pay the\nrent. Applicant also sought financial counseling in May 2008. (Gx. 2)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n5\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations). \n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n6\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n6\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe government presented sufficient information to show, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a - 1.t, that Applicant owed $50,107 for 20 delinquent or past due financial obligations.\nThe debts were unpaid or past due for up to five years. The resulting security concern\nabout Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nMore specifically, the record requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\nBy contrast, Applicant has shown that many of the debts alleged were either not\nhers, were likely her ex-husband\u2019s responsibility when her marriage ended, or have\nbeen resolved. Applicant also established that she was acting to resolve her financial\nproblems long before DOHA adjudicators issued the SOR. As of the hearing, Applicant\nhad paid, resolved, or successfully disputed as invalid all but four of the debts alleged\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.l, and 1.t) totaling $20,691. Of these debts, she likely owes only\nabout $1,400 for SOR \u00b6 1.a and will be able to settle for less than 50% the remaining\ndebts. Combined with her reduction of expenses to free up funds to pay her past\nobligations, and her current positive cash flow, her remaining debts are not likely to\ncause her to act contrary to the national interest to resolve his past delinquencies. \n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n8\n7\nUntil she began the clearance application process, Applicant was unaware of the\nfull extent of debt attributed to her in her credit history. However, she fully disclosed in\nher e-QIP all of the adverse financial information she found when she took it upon\nherself to get a credit report so she could accurately complete that document.\nThereafter, she aggressively went about the task of disputing inaccurate information\nand resolving her obligations, a process that began about a year before the SOR was\nissued. Applicant also sought financial counseling and has, more recently, greatly\nreduced her monthly expenses while she resolves her debts. Applicant actually is\nresponsible for about 40% of the more than $50,000 debt alleged in the SOR. Further, it\nis reasonable to conclude that she will be able to pay or resolve her remaining debt in\nthe next two years.\nAll of the foregoing requires application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(a)\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) (emphasis added), AG \u00b6 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances), AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol), and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts). On balance, Applicant\u2019s information is sufficient to\nmitigate the Guideline F security concerns established by this record. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a 31-year-old single\nmother. Through the actions she has taken to resolve her financial problems, and\nthrough her solid performance at work, has demonstrated she is a mature, responsible\nadult. Her financial problems represent only a brief portion of her background, and she\ndid not intentionally or knowingly mismanage her finances. There has been no\nmisconduct here. Applicant has been forthright and candid about the adverse\ninformation about her finances, and her testimony about her finances was credible.  In\nview of the good health of her current financial circumstances, it is unlikely she will\nexperience such problems in the future or that she will act contrary to the national\ninterest to resolve her remaining delinquencies. A fair and commonsense assessment8\nof all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows she has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns raised by the government\u2019s information.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance is\ngranted.\n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (financial considerations) for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 26, 2009, and DOHA received \nhis answer on June 29, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nApril 20, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nAugust 6, 2009. The case was assigned to me on August 13, 2009.

The record closed on November 6, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. His answers \nwith explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review \nof the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old computer administrator, who has worked for his \ndefense contractor employer since August 2008. He seeks to retain his secret security \nclearance, which is a requirement for his continued employment. (GE 1, Tr. 11-13.)  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1982. He attended a university \nfrom September 1989 to May 1996, and was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree \nin computer science. (GE 1, Tr. 21-22.)  \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from May 1983 to November 1986, and was \nhonorably discharged as a specialist 4 (pay grade E-4). His military occupational \nspecialty was 71L (Administrative Specialist). He successfully held a security \nclearance during his Army service. (GE 1, AE G(3), Tr. 17-18.) \n \nApplicant was married from May 2001 to September 2005. That marriage \nended by divorce. He has an 11-year-old daughter born during that marriage. In March \n2007, he was ordered to pay $152 per week in child support and $292 per week in \nspousal support. He remarried in 2005. His current wife is employed as a mental \nhealth counselor. (GE 1, AE C, 14-20, 67.)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his April 2008 SF-86; his October 2008 responses to DOHA \nInterrogatories; as well as his April 2008, August 2008, October 2008, and December \n2008 credit reports. GE 1 \u2013 7.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified seven separate debts -- one judgment, one state tax \nlien, one charged-off account, two collection accounts, and two past-due accounts, \napproximating $46,000. \n \nApplicant has settled, paid, or otherwise resolved the seven debts alleged. A \nbrief summary of each debt follows. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a judgment in \nfavor of Applicant\u2019s divorce attorney in the amount of $4,315. Applicant submitted \ndocumentation from his divorce attorney that he is making payments on this account \nand his account is current. (GE 3, AE A, AE K, Tr. 24-29.)  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. is a state tax lien in the amount of $2,710. Applicant \nwas making payments to state tax authorities, but used funds earmarked to pay this \ndebt when his former wife\u2019s furnace failed in December 2008. He paid to repair her \nfurnace so his daughter and former wife would have heat. Applicant provided \ndocumentation of this furnace repair. He also provided documentation that he \nresumed payments to state tax authorities and his account is current. (GE 3, AE A, AE \nP, AE N, Tr. 29-35.) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a credit card charged-off account in the \namount of $753. Applicant paid this account in full. (GE 3, AE A, Tr. 35-38.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. is a telephone company collection account in \nthe amount of $517. Applicant paid this account in full. (GE 7, pg. I-14, AE A, Tr. 38-\n40.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. is for child support arrearages owed to the state \nin the amount of $25,467. Applicant submitted documentation that in March 2007 he \nwas ordered to pay $152 per week in child support and $292 per week in spousal \nsupport by way of wage garnishment. He testified that his former wife obtained an ex \nparte support increase without his knowledge, which created a substantial arrearage. \nHe also testified and provided documentation that he did not receive credit for money \npaid to her former spouse. He provided documentation of his claim and is actively \nlitigating this matter with results pending. It is Applicant\u2019s contention that he is current. \n(GE 3, GE 7, AE C, AE R, Tr. 40-51.) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. is for past-due student loans in the amount of \n$12,040. Applicant testified that his former wife was responsible for paying bills while \nthey were married. He stated that his wife assured him that she was making payments \non his student loans and he later discovered that was not the case. Applicant has \ncontacted the lender and is in a \u201crehabilitation\u201d program. He has made payment \narrangements, and his account is current. (AE A, AE B, AE I, Tr. 51-60.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. is a credit card collection account in the amount \nof $597. Applicant paid this account in full. (GE 7, p. I-15, AE A, AE J, Tr. 60-65.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to costs associated with his divorce \nin 2005. He was required to maintain two households on a reduced income. During \nApplicant\u2019s previous marriage, he paid for his wife\u2019s uncovered medical bills and for \nhis daughter\u2019s uncovered dental bills. He also incurred unplanned costs associated \nwith the deaths of his former in-laws. Furthermore, while struggling to maintain two \nhouseholds, he was unemployed for 18 months from August 2005 to January 2007. \nFollowing his divorce, he fell behind on the majority of his debts. (Tr. 23, 71-74.) \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant has paid, settled, made good-faith efforts to repay \noverdue creditors, or resolved all debts alleged. He submitted a budget with his \nmonthly expenses, which reflects a net remainder of $1,300. His budget further \ndemonstrates that he maintains a modest lifestyle and is living within his means. (AE \nH, AE Q, Tr. 67-71.)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant provided reference letters from his current supervisor and a co-\nworker. His supervisor is a senior manager within Applicant\u2019s company. He described \nhim as an employee who is \u201cconsistently pleasant,\u201d \u201ctackling all assignments with \ndedication,\u201d \u201chard worker and always willing to learn,\u201d a \u201cteam player\u201d and someone \nwho \u201cwould make a great asset to any organization.\u201d Applicant\u2019s co-worker referred to \nApplicant as \u201cvery cordial, professional\u201d and as someone who \u201calways maintains his \ncomposure even under the most stressful conditions.\u201d Applicant submitted his most \nrecent performance evaluations that reflect sustained solid performance. (AE D, AE E, \nAE M.) \n \nApplicant submitted copies of his honorable discharge certificate from the Army \nas well as a copy of his DD-214 (Certificate of Discharge from Active Duty). \nCollectively, these documents reflect Applicant\u2019s favorable military service. They \nfurther reflect Applicant\u2019s sense of duty and document three years and six months of \nhonorable military service. ( AE G(1-3). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial \nproblems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \n\n \n6 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by his admissions and evidence \npresented. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.f., he had seven delinquent debts totaling \nabout $46,000 that have been in various states of delinquency since at least 2005. \nThe Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebt. Because there is more than one delinquent debt, his financial problems are not \nisolated. It was not until 2008 and 2009 that these debts were paid or resolved. \nTherefore, his debt is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing \nISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under \nAG \u00b6 20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \ngood judgment.\u201d  Under AG \u00b6 20(b), he receives partial mitigation because of his 2005 \ndivorce, his 18 months of unemployment, costs associated with the funerals of his in-\nlaws, and uncovered medical bills. However, he did not provide sufficient information \nto establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.1  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because Applicant did not seek financial \ncounseling. He has, however, produced a budget that reflects that he is living within \nhis means and regained financial responsibility. Furthermore, there is sufficient \ninformation to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d).2 Applicant has paid, is \npaying, or otherwise resolved his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. which relates to purported child support arrearages. Applicant has submitted \ndocumentation that supports a reasonable basis to dispute the amount owed. To this \nend, he has pending litigation in family court challenging his arrearages.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n \n1\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \nhis debts current. \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists seven \ndebts approximating $46,000 that were at one time or another in various states of \ndelinquency. For several years, he failed to keep his accounts current or negotiate \nlesser payments, showing financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His lack of \nsuccess resolving delinquent debt until recently raises sufficient security concerns to \nmerit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of military service and good employment weighs in his favor. There \nis no evidence of any security violation during the time Applicant may have held a \nsecurity clearance. He is a law-abiding citizen. His debts are current and his SOR \ndebts are all paid, resolved, or being disputed in the case of his child support \narrearages. His monthly expenses are current. The Appeal Board has addressed a \nkey element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019\u201d necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant \nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for \nthe payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is making a significant contribution to the national defense. His company \nfully supports him and recommends him for a security clearance. He made mistakes, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nand debts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. \nHe has paid his debts. Furthermore, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt payments. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant has fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.g.: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 26, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n1\u201cQ: How much did you buy it for?  A: $417,000 . . . Q: How much were you making at the time? . . . A: About\n$3000 a month . . . Q: And how much were your mortgage payments on a $417,000 loan?  A: The mortgage payment\nwas about \u2013 it was close to $3800.\u201d  Tr. at 27-28.    \n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 24, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Arthur E.\nMarshall, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed properly to weigh\nthe record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the decision of\nthe Judge. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an account manager\nfor a Defense contractor.  He has a high school diploma.  Applicant and his wife divorced, and he\nprovides financial support for their three children.  \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1988 to 1992.  Later, during the early 2000s,\nApplicant worked at low-paying jobs.  Most of his earnings went to pay his child support\nobligations.\nIn 2005, Applicant was looking for a job in another state.  He bought a house in that state.\nWithin a month of buying it, he found that he did not get the job.  He ultimately had a judgment\nentered against him due to failure to pay his mortgage on the house.\nHe subsequently returned to his previous domicile to look for work.  He obtained a job\nearning him about $36,000 a year.  He bought another house, for $417,000.  He intended to use it\nas a home and as an investment.  He put no money down on the house, hoping to make his mortgage\npayments by renting out some of the rooms to boarders.  He was unsuccessful in finding work or\nboarders, and he fell behind in his mortgage payments.1  Neither was he able to refinance the\nmortgage.  The house was subsequently sold in a foreclosure sale.  He fell behind in other bills as\nwell.\nApplicant reconciled with his ex-wife.  In mid-2010 he secured a Defense contract, which\nprovides him with a monthly gross salary of $14,750.\nThe delinquent debts which formed the basis of the Judge\u2019s adverse formal findings consist\nof a debt owed to a bank and three mortgage debts, one of which, as stated above, was reduced to\njudgment.\nAppellant contends that the Judge did not extend appropriate weight to evidence he believed\nfavorable to him, such as his history of good job performance, his Marine Corps service, and\n\n3\ncircumstances underlying his mortgage debts which he believes were beyond his control.  However,\na party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009).\nIn support of his appeal Applicant has presented new evidence concerning his efforts at debt\nrepayment following the close of the record.  We cannot consider this new evidence.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also\nISCR Case No. 08-05379 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant has earned a high school diploma. He is divorced and has three children, for whom he provides financial support. From 1988 to 1992, Applicant served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps. During that time, he completed a vocational program in computerized business systems and married. Applicant and his wife had two children during their marriage, but they divorced in 2000. From 2000 until 2005, Applicant \u201cwas just barely making it, and surviving,\u201d working for government agencies at low wages in order to gain work experience in his field. Most of his earnings went toward his child support obligations. 1 2 His finances steadily improved. In late 2005, while pursuing a job in another state, Applicant bought a home in that state. He payed his mortgage payments on this property for a few months. By April 3 2007, however, a judgment had been secured against him for the balance owed. 4 Within about a month after purchasing the house, Applicant learned he did not get the job he was seeking. He quickly returned to his current area of residence to seek other employment options. At the end of 2005 or early 2006, while earning about $36,000, he secured a mortgage and bought a second house for $417,000, which he hoped would serve as both his home and as an investment.

The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn an April 7, 2010, answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the six allegations set\nforth under Guideline F and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA\nassigned the case to me on July 2, 2010. The parties proposed a hearing date of\nAugust 5, 2010. A notice setting that date for the hearing was issued on July 15, 2010. I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and presented four\ndocuments, which were accepted into evidence without objection as exhibits (Exs.) A-D.\nDepartment Counsel offered 14 documents, which were admitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-\n14 without objection. Applicant was given until August 16, 2010, to submit any\nadditional materials. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on August 12,\n2010. On August 16, 2010, Department Counsel forwarded two additional documents\nAugust 24, 2010\n\n Tr. 13.\n      1\n Ex. 9 (Interrogatories, Interview notes at 2). Applicant originally was obligated to pay about $2,100 per\n      2\nmonth in child support. (Elsewhere, Applicant states the sum was about $2,700 per month. See Tr. 49).\nApplicant and his ex-wife later verbally agreed that he should only pay about $1,400-$1,500 per month to\ncover their expenses and after school activities. At one point, an arrearage of about $33,000 was accrued.\nApplicant believes that sum was dismissed, but has not had the issue finalized.

The record was then closed. Based on a review of the\ntestimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden in\nmitigating security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old national account manager working for a defense\ncontractor. He has worked for the same entity since 2001. Applicant has earned a high\nschool diploma. He is divorced and has three children, for whom he provides financial\nsupport. \nFrom 1988 to 1992, Applicant served on active duty in the United States Marine\nCorps. During that time, he completed a vocational program in computerized business\nsystems and married. Applicant and his wife had two children during their marriage, but\nthey divorced in 2000. From 2000 until 2005, Applicant \u201cwas just barely making it, and\nsurviving,\u201d working for government agencies at low wages in order to gain work\nexperience in his field.  Most of his earnings went toward his child support obligations.\n1\n2\nHis finances steadily improved. \nIn late 2005, while pursuing a job in another state, Applicant bought a home in\nthat state.  He payed his mortgage payments on this property for a few months. By April\n3\n2007, however, a judgment had been secured against him for the balance owed. 4\nWithin about a month after purchasing the house, Applicant learned he did not\nget the job he was seeking. He quickly returned to his current area of residence to seek\nother employment options. At the end of 2005 or early 2006, while earning about\n$36,000, he secured a mortgage and bought a second house for $417,000, which he\nhoped would serve as both his home and as an investment.  He did not put any money\n5\ndown toward the purchase.  He hoped to cover his mortgage payments by renting some\n6\nof the rooms in the house to boarders. His attempts to secure local employment failed,\nas did his plans to find boarders. Consequently, he was not able to make any mortgage\npayments. He was then unable to refinance his mortgage at more favorable terms in\ntime to avoid foreclosure or negotiate a short-sale. At some point between 2007 and\n\n Tr. 15, 40.\n      7\n Tr. 31.\n      8\n Tr. 16.\n      9\n Tr. 17. Applicant\u2019s salary had \u201cbeen less than 50,000. . .

The house ultimately sold, but Applicant is unclear as to how much\n7\nhe currently owes the mortgagors after the house\u2019s foreclosure and sale.  He is also\n8\nunclear as to what entity now holds his obligation for the home. \nMeanwhile, Applicant took his period of unemployment as an opportunity to\nreorganize his life.   He worked on refocusing his life between 2008 and 2009,\n9\nconcentrating on work in his prior field. Because wages were low for his area, he fell\nfurther behind on his bills.  In 2009, Applicant and a girlfriend had a son, for whom he\n10\nis currently paying approximately $300 a month in child support. In late 2009, Applicant\nreconciled with his ex-wife. Their reunion re-energized Applicant in his attempts to find\na better job.  In May 2010, Applicant was awarded a contract to provide services to a\n11\ndefense-related agency. In July 2010, he started drawing a salary for himself based on\nhis current gross salary of approximately $14,750 per month.\nAt issue in the SOR are six alleged debts:\n1.a \u2013 Homeowner\u2019s Association debt/judgment ($1,030) \u2013 Payment pending. This debt\nis comprised of a judgment in the amount of $760.79 plus fees and costs.  Applicant\n12\nstated that he has attempted to contact the creditor \u201cduring the last 7 months\u201d in order\nto settle the matter, but he has not been successful.  On July 15, 2010, he petitioned\n13\nthe court to accept payment of the sum at issue and have the judgment released due to\nhis inability to locate the creditor.  He is awaiting action by the court. Otherwise, he is\n14\nwilling and prepared to pay the obligation.15\n1.b \u2013 Utility bill ($539) \u2013 Paid. This debt was settled by payment of $370 on July 14,\n2010.\n\n Tr. 24-26.\n      16\n Tr. 30-32.\n      17\n Tr. 27.\n      18\n Tr. 30-32.\n      19\n Tr. 41-44. \n      20\n Tr. 19, 45.\n      21\n Ex.

He has been unable to\nobtain evidence of satisfaction.  \n16\n1.d \u2013 Charged-off mortgage ($82,980) \u2013 No evidence of payment. This mortgage is\nrelated to the second home Applicant purchased. He has not addressed or made any\ninquiries regarding this obligation.17\n1.e \u2013 Past-due mortgage ($18,737) \u2013 No evidence of payment. This debt is related to\nthe same property as the one described above.  He has not addressed or made any\n18\ninquiries regarding this obligation.19\n1.f \u2013 Foreclosure judgment ($62,282) \u2013 No evidence of payment. This debt is related to\nthe Applicant first home purchase in 2006. Applicant offered no documentary evidence\nindicating he has made any progress in addressing this debt.20\nWith Applicant\u2019s recent and significant increase in income, he sought and is\ncurrently receiving financial counseling with a financial planner.  Applicant now has a\n21\nbudget in place.  He hopes to make progress on his debts within the next few months.\n22\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      23\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      24\n Id.\n      25\n Id.\n      26\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n23\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n24\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n25\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.26\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) is pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this AG that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would\nmitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\n\n AG \u00b6 18.\n      27\n6\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  The guideline sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions. Here,\n27\nApplicant acquired six admitted debts amounting to approximately $166,000, of which\nhe has settled one debt of about $539. The rest of the debt at issue remains unpaid or\nunaddressed. Such facts are sufficient to raise Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\nAG \u00b6 9(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). With such conditions raised,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security\nconcerns. \nBetween 2005 and 2008, Applicant acquired significant debt. Most of that debt\narose from neglected mortgages. Applicant only submitted evidence indicating he has\nattempted to address two debts (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b), debts amounting to about\n$1,570 of the approximately $166,000 at issue. While he offered evidence that he\nrecently received a significant raise in salary and that he now has a budget in place,\nthere is no clear evidence of an articulated strategy to address the remaining debts.\nWhile promises to address the remainder of his debt in the future were offered, the\ncase law deems that such overtures are insufficient to raise Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose during times of unemployment\nor underemployment, conditions which could be sufficient to raise FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b)\n(the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances). However, Applicant\u2019s testimony reflects that most of the debt at issue is\nrelated to real estate mortgages, debts he voluntarily acquired when his income was\nadmittedly deficient for the financial burden assumed. Such facts do not reflect\nresponsible behavior under the circumstances, obviating application of this FC MC. \nApplicant is receiving financial counseling, a factor giving rise to FC MC \u00b6 20(c)\n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). While there is\nevidence he recently has tried to address about $1,570 of the approximately $166,000\nin debt at issue, given the length of time this debt has remained neglected, FC MC \u00b6\n20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) does not apply.\n\n7\nWhile the relatively minor debts noted in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, amounting\nto about $1,757, could be discounted given Applicant\u2019s earlier periods of\nunderemployment and unemployment, the mortgage-related debts reflect a dubious\nsense of financial responsibility. While his first home purchase appears to have been\nwithin his means, he ceased making payments on that mortgage only a few months\nafter it was assumed. In the interim, he sought mortgages and put no money down on a\ncostly second home that was significantly beyond his means. That investment also\nproved to be beyond his means. While he is now receiving financial counseling that\nshould apprise him as to how to live within his means, financial considerations security\nconcerns presently remain unmitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a credible and mature man who served in the U.S. armed forces.\nHe has honored his child support obligations as best he can. He has reconciled with his\nex-wife. Applicant recently ascended to a highly lucrative position. \nWhile Applicant has made some attempts to address his more minor debts, his\ncomparatively exorbitant mortgage-related debts remain uninvestigated, unaddressed,\nand unpaid. While financial counseling should help set him back on course with regard\nto their satisfaction, these unaddressed debts, amounting  to approximately $164,000,\nremain at issue. Consequently, with no concrete plan in place to address these debts,\nfinancial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated. Clearance denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance denied.\nARTHUR E.

He earned a bachelor of science degree in June 1996, a master\u2019s degree in business administration in September 2000, and a bachelor of science in information technology in October 2001 (Tr. 53-54). He has worked for his current employer since May 2008. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married in December 2000 and divorced in May 2005.

Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) dated February 18, 2009; August 6, 2008; March 24, 2009; and May 12, 2009, reflect two credit card accounts with balances of about $5,900 and $3,100, both charged off as bad debts.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 27, 2008. On March \n17, 2009, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 20, 2009; answered it on April 1, 2009; \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nApril 9, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 24, 2009, and the \nJuly 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase was assigned to me on April 27, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April \n28, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May 13, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which \nwere admitted without objection. I kept the record open until May 29, 2009, to enable \nApplicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX G, which \nwas admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX G are \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript on May 28, \n2009. The record closed on May 29, 2009.  \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nOn my own motion and without objection by either party, I amended the SOR to \nreflect Applicant\u2019s correct social security number (Tr. 4). The amendment is handwritten \non the SOR. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nApplicant repeatedly objected to questions from Department Counsel about his \nmarital status, the type of auto he drives, his student loans, and his failure to file income \ntax returns, arguing that information sought was irrelevant (Tr. 50, 54, 71, 73). I \noverruled his objections on the ground that the information was relevant to the whole \nperson analysis.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old production planner for a federal contractor. He earned \na bachelor of science degree in June 1996, a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration in September 2000, and a bachelor of science in information technology \nin October 2001 (Tr. 53-54). He has worked for his current employer since May 2008. \nHe has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was married in December 2000 and divorced in May 2005. He has an \neight-year-old son, for whom he pays child support (Tr. 49). He remarried in October \n2005 and separated from his second wife in March 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) dated February 18, 2009; August 6, \n2008; March 24, 2009; and May 12, 2009, reflect two credit card accounts with balances \nof about $5,900 and $3,100, both charged off as bad debts. They also reflect a \ndelinquent cell phone bill for $86. The August 2008 CBR and the March 2009 CBR \nreflect a delinquent auto loan with a balance of $14,457 that was charged off as a bad \ndebt. The CBR dated May 23, 2009, however, reflects a past due balance of only $371 \non the auto loan (GX 2; GX 3; AX A through E).  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that he assumed the auto \nloan was resolved when the auto was repossessed and sold in 2003, because the \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncreditor has not contacted him about the debt (GX 5 at 2). He has taken no action to \ndispute or resolve the debt.  \n \nApplicant also stated he informed the credit card companies that he had been \nlaid off, and he assumed the debts were written off because he has not been contacted \nby the creditors (GX 5 at 2). His security clearance application reflects that he was \nunemployed from June to November 2001, February to August 2003, September to \nNovember 2004, and in July 2006 (GX 1 at 3-4). He testified his actual period of \nunemployment in 2006 was from June to August (Tr. 40). He has taken no action to \ndispute or resolve the credit card debts. \n \nThe $89 cell phone debt arose when Applicant moved. He was advised by the \ntelephone company that the balance due on his account would be transferred to his new \naccount, but the transfer never occurred (Tr. 31). After the hearing, he presented \ndocumentary evidence reflecting that the bill was paid in full (AX G). He continues to \nhave cell phone service with the same company (Tr. 62). \n \nApplicant testified the delinquent credit card debts were accumulated during his \nfirst marriage, when both he and his wife were laid off from their jobs. They used the \ncredit cards for basic living expenses.  \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s first wife left him, he was responsible for all the accumulated \ndebts. The debts were solely in Applicant\u2019s name because of his wife\u2019s poor credit rating \n(Tr. 83-84). In May 2005, he was ordered to pay child support retroactively for the \nprevious two years (AX F; Tr. 48). His monthly child support payments are $871 (GX 5 \nat 8), and they are automatically deducted from his pay checks (Tr. 49). \n \n \nAll the debts alleged in the SOR are at least six years old. Applicant is not \ndelinquent on any of his current obligations, including his child support (AX F). He \nsubmitted a personal financial statement (PFS) dated November 6, 2008. It reflected net \nmonthly income of $2,688, expenses of $2,600.50, debt payments of $553, and a net \nmonthly remainder of $87.50. It reflected no savings or investments (GX 5 at 6). He \ntestified his current gross income is about $43,000 per year (Tr. 47). \n \n \nApplicant has not filed his federal and state income tax returns for the past three \nyears. He estimates he will owe a total of about $1,600, plus penalties and interest (Tr. \n79-80, 84). He owes about $183,000 in student loans, which are in a deferred status \n(Tr. 55-56). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n4 \n \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling about $23,532. The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-\npronged condition that is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or \nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay \nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \n\u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive \nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other \nfinancial analysis.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(g) is raised by \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised \nbecause there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is \nraised because the evidence reflects that the credit card debts and auto loan \ndelinquency arose during the 2001-2003 time frame, when Applicant\u2019s expenses \nexceeded his income. \n \n \nSince AG \u00b6 19(g) was not alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s admitted failure to file \nhis tax returns for three years may not be considered as an independent basis for \ndenying his application for a clearance. His tax delinquencies may be considered, \nhowever, for the limited purposes of assessing his credibility; deciding whether a \nparticular adjudicative guideline is applicable; evaluating evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; considering whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole person analysis.@ ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \n\n \n6 \n \n \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). All of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts were incurred at least six years ago, but three of the four debts alleged \nremain unresolved. Applicant\u2019s continued employment is subject to the vagaries of the \neconomy, making future periods of unemployment possible, and he has no savings to \nprotect him from further financial difficulty if he is laid off. His failure to take any action to \nresolve the credit card debts and the auto loan delinquency casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant has suffered two \nmarital breakups, several periods of unemployment, and consistent underemployment, \nall of which were largely beyond his control. However, his failure to take any action to \nresolve his delinquent debts after returning to the workforce precludes application of this \nmitigating condition.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Merely waiting for a debt to drop off a credit \nreport by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant\u2019s favor. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). Applicant produced evidence that the \ncell phone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was resolved, but he produced no evidence of \nactions to resolve the remaining debts. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for SOR \u00b6 \n1.c, but not for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). This \nmitigating condition is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but not for the \nremaining debts. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He was sincere and articulate at the \nhearing. He is significantly underemployed for a person of his educational level and \nexperience. He has been able to keep up with current debts, but he is facing delinquent \ntax payments as well as significant educational debt after the deferral period ends. His \nPFS reflects that he is living paycheck to paycheck, with no reserve funds for \nemergencies or temporary periods of unemployment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. Guideline H - Drug Involvement The Government alleges under Guideline H that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has used illegal drugs. The Applicant used marijuana between 10 and 20 times during the period August 2000 and approximately July 2007. According to the Applicant, her use of marijuana was very infrequent, once or twice a year at most. (Transcript at 25-28.) The Applicant was also involved with cocaine.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On March 11, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on April 15, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non May 10, 2009.  I received the case assignment on May 12, 2009.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on May 27, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June\n29, 2009.  The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received\n\n2\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through E, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on\nJuly 8, 2009.  The Applicant asked for the record to remain open and, on July 8, 2009,\noffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F, which was also received without objection. The record\nclosed on July 8, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRuling on Evidence\nThe copy of Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F that was supplied to me by Department\nCounsel contains a notarization statement signed by the Applicant, and a letter of\nrecommendation from a friend of the Applicant\u2019s. Department Counsel indicates that the\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing evidence he received also contained a signed statement of\nintent from the Applicant, stating that she would not use illegal drugs in the future and\nunderstanding that automatic revocation of her security clearance would occur for any\nviolation. (AG \u00b6 26.(b)(4).) Even though the actual statement is not present in the\nrecord, I will consider this case as if such a statement were present. This decision is\nbased on the representation by the Department Counsel, the available documentary\nevidence, and my authority under Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.10, which states, \u201cThe Administrative\nJudge may rule on questions on procedure, discovery, and evidence and shall conduct\nall proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner. (See, Transcript at 35.)\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 25, and has a Bachelor of Arts degree.  She is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe Government alleges under Guideline H that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has used illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant used marijuana between 10 and 20 times during the period August\n2000 and approximately July 2007. According to the Applicant, her use of marijuana\nwas very infrequent, once or twice a year at most. (Transcript at 25-28.)\nThe Applicant was also involved with cocaine. Her use occurred between June\n2007 and December 2007. During that time she used cocaine about 20 times. Her use\nof cocaine ended simultaneously with her graduation from college in December 2007.\n(Transcript at 23-25, 28.)\nThe last time the Applicant used drugs was December 2007. Concerning this\ndecision she states, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to continue that lifestyle. I was ready to be - - I was\nout of college. I was ready to move on with my life and, you know, I matured a lot since\n\n3\nthen, and I knew what I was doing was wrong and I didn\u2019t want to continue down that\npath.\u201d (Transcript at 28.) She further stated, \u201cI\u2019ve grown so much since the time that I\ndid these stupid things, and I know that I\u2019m a smart girl who just did a very dumb thing.\u201d\n(Transcript at 35-36.) She graduated from college in December 2007, moved back to\nher home town, and got a job in the defense industry. She no longer associates with\nany of the people she used drugs with while in college.\nThe Applicant\u2019s employer and members of her family know about her drug use.\nShe also freely informed the Defense Department of her drug use in Government\nExhibit 1 at Section 24. (Transcript at 32, 36-38, 41-42.) The Applicant also expressed a\ndesire to submit a notarized declaration of intent to the Administrative Judge for\ninsertion into the record. (Transcript at 35, 43.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that she is a highly\nrespected person and employee.  She began working in the defense industry in March\n2008. \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A is a letter from the Applicant\u2019s neighbor of 11 years, who is\nalso the Government Lead and Contract Ordering Officer for the contract the Applicant\nsupports. This person states that she trusts the Applicant. In addition, \u201cThrough her\ndiligence, excellent work ethic, professionalism and experience, [the Applicant] was\npromoted to the Team Lead . . . . She is overseeing over 20 personnel and $3.5M.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C and D are from three co-workers, including one of her\nsiblings.  All three of the correspondents recommend that the Applicant be granted a\nsecurity clearance stating she is \u201chonest, fair and trustworthy,\u201d and also someone who\nshows \u201ca high degree of integrity.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E is the Applicant\u2019s performance review for 2008. She is\ndescribed as a \u201csolid contributor\u201d and that she \u201cMeets/Occasionally Exceeds\nExpectations.\u201d\nThe Applicant acts as a care giver for an elderly neighbor. The neighbor\u2019s\ndaughter, who has held a security clearance for 30 years, also submitted a letter on the\nApplicant\u2019s behalf. She describes what the Applicant does for her mother, submits that\nthe Applicant is a trustworthy person, and that she recommends the Applicant for a\nsecurity clearance. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 3.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\n\n4\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by the President in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25\nand especially considered the following:  \n(a) any drug abuse. \nThe Applicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis, from 2000 until\napproximately July 2007. In addition, she used cocaine approximately 20 times during\nthe six month period from June 2007 to December 2007. I find that this disqualifying\ncondition applies. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6\n26 and especially considered the following: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. \nThe evidence is clear that the Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and cocaine were the\nactions of an immature young person. The Applicant\u2019s credible testimonial evidence\nshows that she is extremely remorseful about these events, has been truthful about the\nincidents on repeated occasions with the Government, her employer, as well as her\nfamily, and has taken steps to alleviate any possibility of recurrence. Of particular\n\n6\nweight was her very credible testimony, as well as her presenting to Department\nCounsel a signed statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who engaged in occasional drug abuse while a young\nperson in college. In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the security significance of her prior conduct. As set forth at length above, I\nfind that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). In\naddition, I find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is little to no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nI have specifically considered the span of time between the Applicant\u2019s last use\nof cocaine and the date the record closed. It is a relatively brief span of time, but given\nthe strength of the Applicant\u2019s other evidence, the evidence still supports a finding for\nthe Applicant. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her drug\ninvolvement.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance questionnaire (SF 86), on March 3, \n2009. On June 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline D, Sexual Behavior, and Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 16, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a determination \nbe made in his case without a hearing. On August 25, 2009, Department Counsel \nprepared a File Of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM was mailed to Applicant on \nAugust 27, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on September 2, 2009. He had thirty \ndays from the receipt of the FORM to submit additional matters. He did not submit \nadditional matters. The case was forwarded to the hearing office on November 2, 2009 \nNovember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nand assigned to me on November 3, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and \ndenies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, and 3.a.    \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to obtain a security clearance.  He is an industrial electronic technician and has \nworked for his current employer since January 2008. In response to question 26(a) of \nhis security clearance questionnaire, he indicated that he applied for a security \nclearance in June 1990. It is not clear whether he has a held a security clearance \ncontinuously since that time. He is single and has no children. (Item 4)   \n \nOn October 16, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Stalking, a class \n5 felony. Appellant was infatuated with an 11-year-old girl who lived across the street \nfrom his residence. He first met the girl and her family at a candle light vigil for the \nSeptember 11th attacks.  He came over frequently during the family\u2019s garage sale which \nwas held in early October 2001. She told police that Applicant gave her some candy \nand tried to get her to go away with him out of her parents\u2019 view. On October 15, 2001, \nApplicant made a shrine to the girl on her front porch. The shrine contained six small \nred roses, a balloon that said \u201cI love you,\u201d a necklace, several pens, some candy, and a \nnote to the girl.  On October 16, 2001, Applicant knocked on the 11-year-old girl\u2019s \nresidence at 7:45 am. No one answered the door. The girl\u2019s father was in the shower. \nOnce he got out of the shower, he looked out his bedroom window and saw Applicant \nsitting on their backyard fence wall.  He went outside to ask what Applicant was doing. \nApplicant said he watching the sunrise and wanted to speak to the 11-year-old girl. The \ngirl\u2019s father called 911 and Applicant was arrested. (Item 7) \n \nWhen he was arrested, Applicant possessed another two-page letter addressed \nto the 11-year-old girl, a compact disc with a romantic song on it, and a picture of the \nshrine he left on the 11-year-old girl\u2019s front porch the previous day. During his arrest \nApplicant referred to his 11-year-old neighbor as his goddess. He said that he loved her \nand wanted to marry her. The letters mentioned that he loved the girl and wanted to \nmarry her. In one letter, Applicant indicated that he was sick with love for her and felt \nlike he was going to explode. He indicated that only way he could relieve the tension \nwas to masturbate. He also stated that she will \u201cbecome a woman on Halloween.\u201d (Item \n7)  \n \nOn March 28, 2002, Applicant was found guilty of Attempting Stalking, a class 6 \nundesignated felony.  His punishment included lifetime probation, a $1,770 fine, and \n500 hours community service. He was ordered to have no contact with the victim, abide \nby the Interstate Compact Terms Addendum to Terms of Probation, abide by the Mental \nHealth Addendum to Terms of Probation, abide by the Sex Offender Addendum to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nTerms of Probation, to take all prescribed medication for his mental issues, and \nparticipate in ongoing therapy throughout probation. (Item 9)  \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant filed a motion to terminate his probation and a \nmotion to designate the offense a misdemeanor. On September 21, 2007, the court \ndischarged Applicant from probation and designated the offense a misdemeanor upon \nApplicant\u2019s avowal that he will continue taking his medications prescribed by his doctor. \n(Item 6)  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admits that he was arrested in October \n2001 and convicted of Attempted Stalking. He explains that he gave two gifts and letters \nto the 11-year-old girl to help her feel less sad. He claims there was no sexual behavior \nin the relationship. Although he admits trespassing to give the girl the gifts, he claims \nthe prosecutor was tougher on his case because another criminal was abducting \nchildren in the area at the time of his arrest.  He states that a mental breakdown caused \nhis unusual behavior. He accepts the fact that his mental instability provides a \nreasonable uncertainty as to his ability to keep national security information secret \nbecause his illness affects his judgment. For this reason, he does not contest the \ndecision not to give him a security clearance. (Item 3, Response to SOR)  \n \nAlthough references are made to Applicant\u2019s mental health issues throughout the \nrecord, his mental health condition is not specified other than Applicant\u2019s response to \nquestion 21 on his security clearance questionnaire which asks whether an applicant \nhas consulted a mental health professional within the last 7 years. Applicant answered \nin the affirmative and listed the names of two doctors with whom he has consulted. He \nindicated that he was being treated for bi-polar illness. (Item 4, question 23) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s arrest and conviction for Attempted Stalking, a class 6 felony.  \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise disqualifying \nconditions under the criminal conduct concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See, ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment)  \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including \nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal \nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement) \n \nNeither mitigating condition applies because even though more than eight years \nhave passed since the offense, Applicant does not appear to appreciate the gravity of \nhis conduct. He claims he wrote letters and gave two gifts to the 11-year-old girl to help \nher feel less sad. He indicates that there was no sexual behavior in the relationship. \nWhile there is no evidence that Applicant touched this 11-year-old neighbor \ninappropriately, his letters indicate his sexual feelings for the girl. In the letters he \nprofessed his love for her, implied that she would lose her virginity on Halloween, and \nthat he wanted to make her his bride. He mentioned that the only way he could relieve \ntension over his love for her was to masturbate. While Applicant\u2019s mental health \ncondition was a factor in his conduct, he still minimizes his actions and denies his \nexpressed sexual intentions towards the 11-year-old girl. While the offense was \ndowngraded to a misdemeanor and he was released from probation in September \n2007, his lack of awareness about the seriousness of his conduct precludes me from \napplying either mitigating condition.  \n \nSexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the sexual behavior guideline is set forth in \n\u00b612 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nSexual Behavior Disqualifying Condition (SB DC) \u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a \ncriminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted) \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 13(c) (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress) \n \n \nSB DC \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest and conviction for Attempted Stalking raise all three \ndisqualifying conditions. Applicant\u2019s sexual infatuation with his 11-year-old neighbor girl \nresulted in the criminal stalking offense. His conduct made him vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress because of its inappropriate and offensive nature. He was 39-\nyears-old at the time of the offense. His expressed feelings of love for his 11-year-old \nneighbor and his related conduct reflected a lack of discretion and judgment.  \n \n \nConcerns raised under Sexual Behavior can be mitigated. The following \nmitigating conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \n \nSexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SB MC) \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual behavior \nhappened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) \n \n \nSB MC \u00b6 14(c) (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress) \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply for the same reasons stated above in the \ncriminal conduct section.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied he had sexual \nfeelings towards his 11-year-old neighbor girl. The letters he wrote to her clearly \nexpress his sexual desire for her. Although the arrest and conduct occurred more than \neight years ago, the offense is one that makes an individual vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress regardless of the passage of time. There is insufficient evidence \nin the record for me to conclude Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment are sound.    \n \n \nApplicant has not met his burden of proof to mitigate the concerns raised under \nsexual behavior.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nOf the Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC), \u00b6 6(e) (personal \nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if \nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) \nwhile in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for \nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group) \napplies. Applicant\u2019s past conduct which caused him to be arrested and convicted of \nAttempted Stalking makes him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nbecause the conduct affects his personal, professional and community standing.   \n \n \nThe following Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment)  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition applies. Applicant committed a serious offense in \nOctober 2001.  The nature of the offense and the underlying conduct continues to cast \ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. It also continues to \nmake him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.   \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has not \nbeen arrested since October 2001. I considered that the court released him from \nprobation in 2007 and reduced the felony conviction to a misdemeanor.  Regardless, a \nconcern remains because of Applicant\u2019s minimization of his conduct and his denial that \nhe had any sexual feelings towards his 11-year-old neighbor. Applicant admits that his \nmental instability provides a reasonable uncertainty as to his ability to keep national \nsecurity information secret because his illness affects his judgment. Although \nApplicant\u2019s mental health issues were not raised in the SOR, it certainly is a factor to \nconsider under the whole person. The government established a prima facie case to \nraise concerns under criminal conduct, sexual behavior, and personal conduct. As such, \nthe burden switched to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised. He did not \nmitigate the concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3 Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on \nDecember 3, 2007. On March 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns for foreign influence under Guideline B, and foreign preference under \nGuideline C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended \n(Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 4, 2009. He admitted all of the \nfactual allegations under both Guideline B and Guideline C. Applicant requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non June 5, 2009. The case was initially assigned to another administrative judge. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing for that administrative judge on July 21, 2009, for a hearing \non August 26, 2009. Applicant was not available for the hearing, and the case was \n1 \n \nNovember 25, 2009\n\n2 \n \nreassigned to me on July 24, 2009. DOHA issued a second Notice of Hearing on \nAugust 13, 2009, for a hearing on August 31, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. The government offered three exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. \nEx.) 1 through 3, which were received without objection. Applicant did not submit any \nexhibits at the hearing. Applicant testified on his behalf. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit documents. Applicant timely submitted three documents admitted as \nApp. Ex. A through C. The Government had no objections to the documents and they \nwere admitted as exhibits (Gov. Ex. 4, Letter, dated September 25, 2009). DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on September 8, 2009. Based on a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant did not receive the August 13, 2009 Notice of Hearing since he was on \ntravel out of the country. However, he knew of the hearing since the original hearing had \nbeen postponed at his request from August 26, 2009. Applicant is entitled to 15 days \nnotice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department Counsel the \nsetting of a hearing date after August 30, 2009, when he would be returning from a trip. \nApplicant never signed for the Notice of Hearing for August 31, 2009, but he stated he \nhad sufficient notice of the hearing date and he waived the requirement for the 15 day \nnotice requirement (Tr. 6-7). \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Sudan and Saudi Arabia. The requests and attached \nsupporting documents were not admitted into evidence but are included in the record as \nHearing Exhibits. Applicant had no objection to the requests for administrative notice or \nthe attached documents. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of \nFact, below (Tr. 28-30, Hearing Exhibit I and II).  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations raised \nin the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior computer programmer and analyst for a defense \ncontractor. He was born in Sudan. His family still resides in Sudan. Their home is in the \nmiddle of the country near the capital. He was educated in Sudan. He received his first \ncollege degree in petroleum engineering from a Sudanese university in 1998. He \nreceived another college degree in computer science from a United States university in \n2002. He is married with one child (Tr. 21-25). \n \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in 1999, and became a United States \ncitizen in December 2006. When Applicant immigrated to the United States, he \npossessed and used a Sudanese passport which expired in 2006. He used this \n\n3 \n \npassport for travel until he received his United States passport. He received a United \nStates passport in 2006 shortly after becoming a United States citizen. After becoming a \nUnited States citizen and receiving a United States passport, he used his Sudanese \npassport only to establish for Sudanese authorities that he was originally from Sudan. \nHe sends a copy of the first two pages of his expired Sudan passport to Sudanese \nauthorities to establish he originally came from Sudan, which entitles him to a 50% \ndiscount on the Sudan entry visa fee. He has the expired passport only because he has \na habit of maintaining all of his important documents and records, and to obtain the visa \ndiscount. The passport cannot be used as a basis to have a current passport issued by \nSudan (Tr. 21-22). \n \n \nApplicant comes from a large family. His parents, five sisters, and two brothers \nare citizens and residents of Sudan. His father is a retired school teacher and his \nmother is a homemaker. Since all schools were public schools run by the government \nwhen his father taught, he is considered to have worked for the government. Three of \nhis sisters are married and are homemakers. Their husbands are a civil engineer and \nsmall business owners. One brother is a college student, and the other has graduated \nfrom college but is still seeking employment. He has another brother who is a citizen of \nSudan, but a resident of Saudi Arabia, employed as an electrical engineer by an \nAmerican company. Applicant has a close relationship with his family and they are all on \ngood terms. Applicant talks to his parents by telephone at least weekly, and sends them \n$300 monthly to assist with living expenses. He would call them more often if the \ntelephone calls were not so expensive (Tr. 33-36).  \n \n \nApplicant's wife was also born in Sudan. Applicant and his wife have known each \nother since childhood since they grew up together. They married in Sudan before \nimmigrating to the United States. Her parents and four brothers are citizens and \nresidents of Sudan. Applicant's wife talks to her family weekly. Applicant talks to them \noften. The families are close and on good terms (Tr. 36-37). \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Sudan in 2002, 2004, and 2006 to visit his family. He used \nhis Sudanese passport on the first two trips because he was not yet a United States \ncitizen in possession of a United States passport. After he became a United States \ncitizen in December 2005 and received a United States passport in early 2006, he \ntraveled solely on his United States passport. He and his family visited his family in \nSudan in the summer of 2009 for six weeks. He used his United States passport to \nenter and leave the United States and Sudan. He sent a copy of his expired Sudanese \npassport to the Sudanese authorities to receive a discount on his visa application. He \nvisited his family and in-laws and stayed with his parents during his visit (Tr. 35-36).  \n \n \nWhile a college student, Applicant did not join societies or organizations that \nwere campus organizations affiliated with the government. Membership and activities in \nthese organizations is a key element in finding employment in your chosen field after \ncollege. Applicant graduated as a petroleum engineer and all petroleum engineer jobs in \nSudan are government positions. Since Applicant had not joined the societies, he could \nnot find employment as a petroleum engineer. He and his wife decided to immigrate to \nthe United States for more freedom and better opportunity. He does not like the \n\n4 \n \ngovernment of Sudan and does not support it. His family is not political or aligned with \nthe government (Tr. 24-29, 42). \n \n \nApplicant noted on his SF 85P, Application for a Position of Public Trust, that he \nwas a dual citizen of the United States and Sudan. In response to questions asked by \nsecurity adjudicators in Interrogatories, Applicant noted that he has an allegiance both \nto the United States and Sudan. Applicant stated at the hearing that he can do nothing \nabout his dual citizenship with Sudan. He was born and raised in Sudan and spent the \nfirst 26 years of his life there. However, his chosen country for citizenship is the United \nStates. As to his statement of allegiance to Sudan, he stated at the hearing that he was \ntalking not about the government of Sudan but his family and friends in Sudan. Like any \nimmigrant to the United States, he has a degree of affection for the land and people \nwhere he came from (Tr. 24-26). \n \n \nApplicant presented letters from friends and co-workers attesting to his work \nethic and character. The manager at his present employment states Applicant always \ndisplays excellent commitment to his work and is well regarded by his fellow employees \n(App. Ex. A, Letter, dated September 10, 2009). A fellow worker, who has known \nApplicant at two different companies, stated Applicant is always positive and up-beat. \nHe keeps projects on track and is known as the person who is honest and truthful about \nthe status of the projects. Applicant can always be counted on to exhibit a positive and \nhappy attitude (App. Ex. B, Letter, undated). Another co-worker notes that Applicant \ndisplays a high degree of integrity, responsibility, and determination. He is always \nrespectful to management and his co-workers. He is known as a dependable team \nplayer who uses sound judgment to arrive at logical and practical solutions to problems \n(App. Ex. C, Letter, dated September 7, 2009). Applicant is recommended by all three \nfor a position of public trust. \n \n \nSudan was administered jointly by Egypt and Britain for a number of years, with \nBritain assuming management control and policy formulation in the late 1880s. In \nFebruary 1953, Britain and Egypt concluded an agreement that assured self \ngovernment and self determination for Sudan. Since gaining its independence, Sudan \nhas endured continuous wars within its borders. Most of its civil strife is rooted in deep \ncultural and religious differences that have stunted the economic and political \ndevelopment of its non-Muslim peoples in the south and west of Sudan. Northerners \nwho have controlled the country since independence have pursued uniting policies \nbased on Arabism and Islam over the opposition of southerners and marginalized \npeoples in the south, east and west regions. Sudan has one of the most diverse \npopulations in all of Africa, comprised mainly of two groups designated as Arabs and \nBlack Africans/Christians, with hundreds of ethnic and tribal subdivisions and \nlanguages. This diverse population mix presents major challenges to collaborative \nefforts of government.  \n \n \nThe Islam Army Faction group in Sudan mounted a military coup and installed \nthe National Islamic Front. The commitment of this government to Islamism intensified \nregional conflicts. Sudan became less responsive to the grievances of populations \noutside of their northern political base. The government continued its internal political \n\n5 \n \nrepression against non-Muslim groups and added its support to Islamist groups in \nAlgeria, and to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. \n \n \nRegional efforts to broker a cessation of the Sudanese civil war between the \nnorth and south/west provinces of the country were numerous throughout the 1990s. \nImplementation of key provisions of the peace agreement failed to materialize. With the \ncollapse of the peace agreement, rebellion in the Darfur region of Sudan ensued, \nresulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of Darfur's inhabitants and mass internal \ndisplacement of two million persons in Sudan. The Sudanese government is complicit \nand bears principal responsibility in the bombing, murder, and rape of innocent civilians \nin the Darfur region. \n \n \nSudan was designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. State Department \nin August 1983, and remains on the State Department\u2019s list of State sponsors of \nterrorism. Sudan is under a broad U.S. embargo, and is subject to the Treasury \nDepartment\u2019s extensive trade restrictions on exports and re-exports to this country. \nThese restrictions were eased, but not removed. Sudan\u2019s human rights abuses are cited \nas proof that the country poses an unusual continued threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States.  \n \n \nSudan today is governed under a power-sharing arrangement established in \nJanuary 2005. This arrangement established an interim government of national unity, \ndominated by Islamists from the north. Human rights abuses continue to be a serious \nproblem in Sudan. The State Department\u2019s report on human rights in the Sudan paints a \ngrim picture. Sporadic violence continues to occur in the south. The government bears \nultimate responsibility for extraordinary human rights abuses that have exploded on all \nfronts: rape, violence, hunger, displacement and looting. Human rights abuses include \nharsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, including incommunicado \ndetention of suspected government opponents and prolonged pre-trial detention, \nexecutive interference with the judiciary, denial of due process, widespread prostitution, \ntrafficking in persons, and harassment of journalists and religious groups. \n \n \nIn recent years, Sudan became a cooperative partner in global counterterrorism \nefforts with the United Stated and other countries. In the past year, the Sudanese \ngovernment continued to pursue terrorist operations directly involving threats to United \nStates interests and personnel in Sudan. Sudanese officials have indicated that they \nview their continued cooperation with the United States as important and recognize the \nbenefits of United States training and information sharing. Though the counterterrorism \nrelationship remains solid, some hard-line Sudanese officials continued to express \nresentment and distrust over actions by the United States and questioned the benefits \nof the bilateral cooperation. Their assessment reflected disappointment that Sudan's \ncounterterrorism cooperation has not resulted in its removal from the State Sponsors of \nTerrorism list. Nonetheless, there was no indication that the Sudanese government will \ncurtail its counterterrorism cooperation with the United States (See, Hearing Exhibit 1, \nUnited States State Department Document on Sudan). \n \n\n6 \n \nSaudi Arabia is a monarchy-ruled Middle East country. There are no political \nparties or elections. There are significant human rights problems. The religious police \nharass and abuse individuals to comply with religious actions and customs. However, \nSaudi Arabia and the United States share a common concern over regional security. \nThe United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia was strained after September 11, \n2001, because the overwhelming majority of terrorists were from Saudi Arabia. There \nhave been other terrorist attacks against United States citizens since 2001. This \nrequired the State Department to issue a travel warning for Saudi Arabia because of the \nterrorist activities targeted against American citizens and interests. Saudi Arabia \nbelieves in fighting terrorism in its own country, and has taken steps to curtail terrorist \nand terror plans within its borders. It has had some successes (See Hearing Exhibit II. \nBackground notes, Saudi Arabia, dated June 2007 and Saudi Arabia Country Report on \nHuman Rights Practices, 2006). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . \" assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \n\n7 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties of foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in the U.S. \ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which \nthe foreign contact or financial interest is located, including but not limited to, such \nconsideration as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism (AG \u00b6 6).  \n \n \nApplicant has frequent and extensive contact with his parents and siblings in \nSudan. He talks to his parents weekly, and tries to visit Sudan every few years. He \nsends his parents funds monthly to assist them. He admits he and his family have a \nclose relationship. He also admits to a close relationship with his brother, who is a \ncitizen of Sudan but resides in Saudi Arabia. His contact with his family is extensive and \nraises security concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 \n7(a) (Contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates \na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion); and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) (Connections to a foreign person, group, government, \nor country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information).  \n \n \nThe mere existence of a foreign family member is not sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. The nature of Applicant\u2019s contact with his family in \nSudan and Saudi Arabia must be examined to determine whether it creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n\u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative term denoting increased risk compared to some normally \nexisting risk that can be inherent anytime a family member lives subject to a foreign \n\n8 \n \ngovernment. One factor that heightens the risk in Applicant's case is the extensive \nhuman rights abuses, terrorist activity, and on-going tribal conflict in Sudan.  \n \n \nApplicant raised facts to mitigate the security concerns for his family in Sudan \nand Saudi Arabia. I have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \nAG \u00b6 8(a) (The nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.); FI MC AG \u00b6 8(b) (There is no conflict of interest, either because \nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, \nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest); and FI MC AG \u00b6 8(c) (Contact or communication \nwith foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation). \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d The underlying premise was \nthat an applicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a \nchoice between the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States. \nThere was no balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk. Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the United States \ninterest.  \n \n \nThe nature of the human rights abuses, terrorist threats, and conflicts in Sudan \nplaces a heavy burden on Applicant in mitigating the disqualifying conditions and the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant's relationship with his family is close. He talks to his \nparents weekly and sends them funds to assist in their support. He tries to visit the \nfamily in Sudan every few years. His wife talks to her family frequently, and he talks to \nthem when he can. His relationships with his family in Sudan is close and not casual so \nthere could be a circumstance where Applicant is placed in a position of having to \nchoose between his family members and the interests of the United States because of \nthe nature of the conflict and threat of terrorism in Sudan. Accordingly, FI MC AG \u00b6 8(a) \nand FI MC AG \u00b6 8(c) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has little, if any, sense of loyalty to Sudan and none to Saudi Arabia. \nHis only contact with Saudi Arabia is his brother's presence in that country working for a \nUnited State company. He spent his early years in Sudan until he graduated from \ncollege. He came to this country because he could not find meaningful employment in \nhis chosen field in Sudan. He refused to join certain organizations in college that were \naffiliated with the government that would ensure him government employment in his \nchosen field. He came to this country with his wife for freedom and an opportunity to \nbetter his life. He became a United States citizen as soon as he could, and has been \nsuccessful as a computer programmer. He sees the United States as offering him \n\n9 \n \nfreedom, justice, and tolerance with an opportunity to reach his potential. While he \nprovided funds to assist his parents, he sent the funds as a dutiful son and not to assist \nthe government of Sudan or any terrorist element in the country. His visits back to \nSudan were in the ordinary course of visiting family. Applicant's sense of loyalty or \nobligation is not to Sudan or terrorists but to the United States. A conflict of interest in \nthis case is extremely unlikely. In balancing all of the factors mentioned and considered \nabove, I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is such that he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest. FI MC \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. Applicant has met his heavy burden to show that his contact with his \nfamily in Sudan and Saudi Arabia does not cause a security concern. I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns rising from his contact with his family in \nSudan and his brother in Saudi Arabia.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then he may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States (AG \u00b6 9). The principal \ngoal of the Foreign Preference assessment is to determine the risk, based on foreign \nassociations, that information may be compromised if access to sensitive information is \napproved. It is not a measure of Applicant's loyalty to the United States. \n \n \nSudan considers Applicant to be a Sudanese citizen because he was born and \nraised in Sudan. Applicant came to the United States as a Sudanese citizen on a \nSudanese passport to find employment and better his life. When he became a United \nStates citizen in 2005, he retained his Sudanese passport, which expired in 2006. He \nkept it because it was his habit to keep old documents and he could use the passport to \nestablish he was from Sudan and receive a discount when he applied for a visa to enter \nSudan. He did send to Sudanese officials a copy of the passport this year to receive a \ndiscount on a visa for his most recent visit to Sudan. His possession of the Sudanese \npassport raises Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) \n(Exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a \nUnited States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This \nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport). \n \n \nIn response to this disqualifying condition, Applicant raised Foreign Preference \nMitigating Conditions (FP MC) AG \u00b6 11(b) (The individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship), and FP MC AG \u00b6 11(e) (The passport has been \ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated). \nApplicant has denounced his citizenship with Sudan and his only citizenship is with the \nUnited States. He still possesses his old passport but it is not current or valid. It cannot \nbe used as a document to receive a current Sudanese passport. The Sudanese \npassport is invalid, and not held by Applicant to enable him to enter or leave any \ncountry. Applicant has, therefore, mitigated security concerns for access to classified \ninformation raised by possession of a Sudanese passport. \n \n \n\n10 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I carefully considered all of the \ncircumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \nwell as the following factors in light of the whole person concept. The whole person \nconcept requires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single \nitem in isolation, to reach a determination concerning Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. Applicant has a close relationship with his family in Sudan. There \nis extensive terrorist activity in Sudan and it is an area in which major terrorist \norganizations operate. These simple facts alone might be sufficient to raise security \nconcerns over Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. However, \nmere family ties with people in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. Whether an applicant\u2019s family ties in a foreign country \npose a security risk depends on an evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of \nthe family ties.   \n \nApplicant has established his strong loyalties to the United States. He also \nestablished he has no real loyalty to Sudan or to any terrorist organization or activity \noperating in Sudan. His loyalty to the United States counters the fact his family \nmembers are citizens and residents of Sudan and Saudi Arabia. Overall, on balance, \nthe record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a trustworthiness position. Applicant's connections to Sudan or Saudi \nArabia do not create a heightened risk related to national security. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has met the heavy burden of mitigating all potential \nsecurity concerns arising from his family in Sudan and Saudi Arabia, as well as his \npossession of his expired Sudanese passport. Accordingly, I find that Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence and foreign preference. \nHe should be granted access to sensitive information. \n\n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of \npublic trust.

Gunn, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the drug involvement security concerns arising from her \nillegal use of marijuana. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on March 24, 2008 \n(Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)) (GE 3). On November \n18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her alleging security concerns under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement).1 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, modified and revised. \n \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on December 1, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 26, \n2009. DOHA issued the notice of hearing on February 4, 2009. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on February 27, 2009. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 12). Applicant testified on her own \nbehalf, and presented two witnesses and exhibits (AE) 1 through 8, which were \nadmitted without objection (Tr. 16). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nMarch 10, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old program analyst working for a defense contractor. \nWhile in high school, between October 1994 and August 1996, she experimented with \nmarijuana approximately five times with her high school friends. During her senior year \nin high school, she began dating and decided that using marijuana was no longer part of \nher life and stopped using marijuana. She graduated in the top 10% of her high school \nclass (Tr. 31). She completed her bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism in 2000, graduating \nwith a 3.86 grade point average. She is currently pursuing a graduate degree (Tr. 74).  \n \nAfter college, Applicant was hired as a full-time employee by a U.S. government \ncontractor. Pursuant to her employment, in 2001, she submitted a security clearance \napplication in which she disclosed she used marijuana five times between October 1994 \n(age 16) and August 1996. During a follow up interview by a government investigator in \nMarch 2002, Applicant confirmed her use of marijuana and promised never to use illegal \ndrugs again. She was granted access to classified information at the secret level.  \n \nApplicant worked for her first employer from January 2001 to January 2006. She \nleft her job because she believed she had outgrown her position. She was hired by a \nsecond government contractor and worked for it approximately two years. In November \n2007, Applicant was hired by her current employer, another government contractor. She \nhas held access to classified information at the secret level continuously since 2001. All \nthree of her employers had policies prohibiting their employees\u2019 use of illegal drugs. She \nwas aware of such policies, and that the use of marijuana was illegal. \n \nIn the summer of 2005, Applicant used marijuana (Tr. 57-60). She explained that \nher fianc\u00e9 left her under some ugly circumstances. She sought help and was diagnosed \nwith depression and prescribed medication which she took for one year. She is no \nlonger on medications. During the summer of 2005, her husband (then a friend) came to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nvisit and offered her some marijuana. They smoked the marijuana cigarette together. He \nwas given the marijuana by a long-time friend (X). \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant purchased a condo and celebrated the purchase by \nhaving a house warming party. After the party, Applicant and her husband (then \nboyfriend) smoked marijuana from a pipe. He had been given the marijuana by the \nsame long-time friend (X) that gave him the marijuana in 2005 (Tr. 60). \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant submitted another security clearance application \nseeking an upgrade of her access level. She disclosed she used marijuana twice \nbetween July 2005 and March 2007 (once in 2005 and once in July 2006) while \npossessing a security clearance (GE 3, Section 24). During the follow up interviews, \nApplicant refused to disclose she had smoked marijuana with her now husband, and \nthat the marijuana was provided to her husband by his long-time friend (GEs 4 & 5). In \nher answer to the SOR, Applicant explained she disclosed her past marijuana use \nbecause she believed that as part of the security clearance process she would be \nsubject to a polygraph examination that would unveil her bad judgment (Tr. 64, answer \nto the SOR). At her hearing, Applicant was candid and forthcoming promptly answering \nany and all questions about the circumstances surrounding her use of marijuana. \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for her use of marijuana both in 2005 and \n2006. She knew that the use of marijuana was illegal and would reflect adversely on her \nability to hold a security clearance. She acknowledged she made two bad decisions and \nthat her actions reflect bad judgment. She has not used marijuana since 2006, because \nsuch behavior does not fit with her lifestyle anymore or who she is now (Tr. 62). She \ntestified she has observed her husband use marijuana only twice during the four years \nthey have known each other. She claimed he does not smoke marijuana anymore. \nApplicant and her husband no longer associate with (X). She has seen (X) only once \nsince 2006, at a friend\u2019s wedding.  \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant submitted a statement of intent (AE 2), promising never \nto use illegal drugs again, and agreeing to an automatic revocation of her clearance if \nshe ever uses illegal drugs again while possessing a security clearance. Applicant is \nloyal to the United States, and believes her drug related behavior does not make her a \nthreat to the safety of classified information. She disclosed her past drug use and her \npending security clearance hearing to three or four of her supervisors and friends. She \nbelieves her past drug use cannot be used as leverage against her.  \n \nApplicant believes she is more stable mentally and emotionally now than she \nwas in 2005. She has been married to her husband approximately one and one-half \nyears and they have a good relationship. She performs as stepmother to her husband\u2019s \neight-year-old son, and serves as a soccer coach. Additionally, she participates in \ncharitable community activities. \n \nSince graduating from college, Applicant has worked for three different \ngovernment contractors. She is considered by supervisors and friends to be a trusted, \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                     \ndependable, and valuable employee. She is extremely reliable, honest, and truthful. She \nis regarded as a hard worker with excellent job performance. There is no evidence she \nhas compromised classified information during the eight years she has possessed a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant\u2019s past and current supervisors recommended she receive \naccess to classified information without reservations.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is \na fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process \nis a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person \nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the government\u2019s security concern about drug involvement: \n \nuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides eight drug involvement conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three drug involvement disqualifying conditions raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: AG \u00b6 25(a): \u201cany \ndrug abuse;\u201d4 AG \u00b6 25(b): \u201cillegal drug possession;\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g): \u201cany illegal drug \nuse after being granted a security clearance.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply. Applicant used marijuana in high school, \nand in the summer of 2005 and July 2006, while she possessed a security clearance. \nThe other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable.  \n \nShe disclosed her illegal drug use on her 2001 and 2008 security clearance \napplications, to government investigators, and at her hearing. She used illegal drugs \ninitially because she was curious about the effects of the drugs and her peers and \nfriends were using illegal drugs. She used marijuana in 2005 and 2006, because at the \ntime she believed it would be fun and would make her feel better. She possessed these \nillegal drugs before she used them.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n \n4AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find AG \u00b6 26(a) and (b) apply. There are no \n\u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be \nbased \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by \nthe directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). All of the \ninformation the government has concerning Applicant\u2019s use of drugs was disclosed by \nher. She experimented with marijuana five times while in high school between 1994 and \n1996. She then used marijuana again once in 2005 and once in July 2006, while \npossessing a security clearance. Her last use of marijuana was in July 2006.  \n \nIt has been approximately 32 months since Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana. I \nfind that \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct.\u201d \nSince that last use of marijuana, Applicant married her husband and assumed the role \nof stepmother for her eight-year-old stepson (albeit during the weekends). She was not \na frequent abuser of illegal drugs. She has expressed sincere remorse for her past \nmisconduct and submitted a statement of intent never to use illegal drugs again. \nApplicant has matured since her last use of marijuana and I believe she now fully \nunderstands the legal and adverse security clearance consequences of such \nirresponsible behavior. Applicant\u2019s abstinence from illegal drugs, her new personal \ncircumstances, and her work performance warrant a finding of reform and rehabilitation. \nFor the above stated reasons, her past use of marijuana does not raise doubts about \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate her intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. She has somewhat disassociated from her drug-facilitating \nassociate (X); although, she is married to the person with whom she used marijuana in \n2005 and 2006. She testified her husband no longer uses marijuana. Moreover, she \nprovided \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance includes her \nexperimentation with marijuana while in high school, and her use of marijuana in 2005 \nand 2006 while possessing a security clearance. Because of her 2001 security \nclearance application and follow up interview, Applicant knew or should have known of \nthe government\u2019s security concerns regarding her past use of illegal drugs. She even \npromised to never use illegal drugs again. Obviously, her employers had policies \nagainst using drugs which she was aware of and violated. Notwithstanding her 2001 \npromise, Applicant illegally used marijuana in 2005 and 2006. She continues to \nassociate with her husband, the person who provided her with the marijuana in 2005 \nand 2006. \n \nThe evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. \nShe is 31 years old and has worked for government contractors for approximately eight \nyears. She is considered a top notch employee with excellent potential. Applicant was \nyoung and immature when she began using illegal drugs. She stopped using illegal \ndrugs after high school and only used drugs twice in 2005 and 2006. She disclosed her \nhistory of drug use on her 2001 and 2008 security clearance applications. She \nsubsequently admitted her drug use to a government investigator, in her response to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nDOHA interrogatories, on her SOR response, and at her hearing. She knows the \nconsequences of drug abuse.  \n \nThere is no evidence at work of any other disciplinary problems. There is no \nevidence of disloyalty or that she would intentionally violate national security. Her \ncharacter and good work performance show responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. \nHer supervisors fully support her security clearance. They consider her questionable \nbehavior out of character for Applicant. I am satisfied Applicant has learned her lesson. \nShe has not used illegal drugs during the last 32 months. She has expressed sincere \nremorse for her past drug-related behavior, and promised to abstain from illegal drug \nuse. Moreover, she signed a statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \nOn balance, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the \nfacts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has \nmitigated the drug involvement security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 6, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 21, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant points out his excellent job performance, work\nethic, and military record.  He contends that the Judge should have accorded greater weight to his\nevidence of mitigation, and he argues that loss of his job will hinder his efforts to improve his\nfinancial situation.    \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is 37 years old and is employed\nas a security officer.  Applicant has an excellent job performance record and is highly thought of by\nhis coworkers and his supervisor.  \nIn its SOR, the government alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owed about $26,139\nfor 14 delinquent debts more than 90 days past due.  Applicant admitted all of the debts, but asserted\nthat three of the 14 had been paid or otherwise satisfied.  Applicant has used debt consolidation and\ndebt counseling firms within the last two years, but there is no record of payments being made under\nthose services.  Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to the legal fees he accrued in defending\nhimself against the criminal charges listed below.     \nThe five SOR allegations under Guideline J relate to domestic violence, all but one involving\nhis relationships with two women.  Girlfriend 1 called the police after an argument in May 2007,\nand Applicant was charged with domestic violence/harassment and convicted.  Applicant was\nordered to pay a fine of $300 and attend a domestic violence intervention program, and he received\na 60-day suspended sentence and was placed on probation for 24 months.  When Applicant appealed\nto the  circuit court, the case was dismissed because Girlfriend 1did not cooperate with the\nprosecutors.  Later in May 2007, Applicant was investigated for harassing communications toward\nGirlfriend 1, and a protective order was issued.  In September 2007, Applicant was charged with and\nconvicted of violating the protective order.  Applicant was sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended),\nplaced on probation for 12 months, fined, and assessed court costs.  Applicant listed the above\noffenses on his security clearance application, but denied that he was guilty of the charges.\nApplicant admitted a domestic violence charge by Girlfriend 2 in December 2006.  Applicant was\nnot prosecuted, but he agreed to attend an eight-week violence intervention program.  When\nApplicant completed his security clearance application in February 2008, he was awaiting trial on\ntwo charges\u2013violation of a protective order and domestic violence/harassment.  At the time of the\nhearing, Applicant was still awaiting trial on another domestic violence charge dating from\nDecember 2009. \nIn support of his appeal, Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation from Girlfriend 1.\nThe Board cannot consider that letter, since it constitutes new evidence.  See Directive, \u00b6 E3.l.29.\nSee also ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  Applicant submitted a second set\nof new documents after his brief was accepted.  The Board cannot consider these either. \n\n3\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law,\narguing that the Judge did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his excellent job\nperformance, work ethic, and military record.  Applicant also maintains that the Judge should have\naccorded greater weight to his attempts to settle his debts and his explanations for his criminal\nrecord.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence, unless\nthe Judge specifically states otherwise; and there is no requirement that the Judge mention or discuss\nevery piece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 16, 2005).   In this case, the Judge mentioned Applicant\u2019s excellent performance and\nreputation at work, as well as his military record.  The Judge also discussed Applicant\u2019s attempts\nto improve his financial situation and found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to eight of the fourteen\nGuideline F allegations.  However, the application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23,\n2007).\nApplicant states that loss of his job due to denial of a security clearance will have an adverse\nimpact on his ability to improve his financial situation.  However, the effect that an adverse decision\nmay have on an applicant is not a relevant or material consideration in evaluating his or her security\neligibility.  See, e.g.,ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009). \nAfter reviewing the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a set of interrogatories  to clarify or augment potentially disqualifying\n1\ninformation in his background. After reviewing the results of the background\ninvestigation and Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were\nunable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the\n2\nSeptember 21, 2010\n\n The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. These\n3\nguidelines were published in the Federal Register and codified through 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006).\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n See Directive, E3.1.13. On September 30, 2009, Department Counsel sent the documents to the Applicant\n4\nas required. It is not known why Applicant did not receive them.\n2\nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On July 6,\n2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which, if\nproven, raise security concerns addressed in the adjudicative guidelines (AG)  for\n3\ncriminal conduct (Guideline J) and financial considerations (Guideline F).\nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to an administrative judge on November 17, 2009. Pursuant to a Notice of\nHearing issued on January 12, 2010, a hearing was convened on February 1, 2010.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled; however, it was determined that Applicant had not\nreceived in advance of the hearing copies of the documents the Government intended\nto introduce.  The administrative judge concluded that Applicant was not prepared to\n4\nmove forward and agreed to continue the hearing to an unspecified date. DOHA\nreceived a transcript of that hearing (Tr. I) on February 8, 2010.\nThe case was transferred to me on April 1, 2010. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing\nissued on April 6, 2010, I reconvened the hearing in this matter on April 29, 2010. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The Government presented eight exhibits that were\nadmitted without objection as Government Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 8. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted ten documents that were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits\n(Ax.) A - J. I left the record open after the hearing to give Applicant time to submit\nadditional relevant information. DOHA received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on May\n6, 2010. The record closed on May 7, 2010, when I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing\nsubmission, which is included in the record without objection as Ax. K.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed about $26,139\nfor 14 unpaid debts (SOR 1.a - 1.n) that were more than 90 days past due (SOR 1.k);\nthat had been charged off as business losses by the creditors (SOR 1.g and 1.j); that\nrepresented the balance due after a vehicle repossession (SOR 1.i); or that had been\nreferred to collection agencies (SOR 1.a - 1.f, 1.h, 1.l - 1.n). Applicant admitted all of the\nallegations under this guideline. However, as to SOR 1.h, 1.k, and 1.n, he also averred\nthat he has paid or otherwise satisfied these debts.\nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged that in September 2007, Applicant\nwas charged with and convicted of violating a protective order, for which he was\nsentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended), placed on 12 months of probation, fined, and\nassessed court costs. (SOR 2.a) It was also alleged that the aforementioned protective\norder was issued on May 24, 2007, after he was investigated for harassing\ncommunications (SOR 2.b); that on May 7, 2007, Applicant was charged with domestic\n\n3\nviolence in the form of 3  degree harassment, of which he was convicted and\nrd\nsentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended), placed on 24 months of probation, assessed a\nfine and court costs, and ordered to complete a domestic violence intervention course\n(SOR 2.c); that in December 2006, he was charged with 3  degree domestic violence,\nrd\nwhich was nolle prosequi, and he was assessed court costs and ordered to complete a\ndomestic violence intervention course (SOR 2.d); and that in June 1996, Applicant was\ncharged with and convicted of domestic violence, to wit, harassment (SOR 2.e). In\nresponse, Applicant admitted the SOR 2.d allegation, but denied the remaining\nallegations under this guideline. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Having reviewed\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nadditional findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 37 years old and is employed as a security officer with a defense\ncontractor, for whom he has worked since October 2007. He has held similar jobs with\nother companies since July 2001. His position requires that he hold a security\nclearance. Applicant was first granted a security clearance in 1998, when he was in the\nU.S. Army. Applicant enlisted in the Army in October 1994 and served on active duty\nuntil March 2001. Thereafter, he served in a reserve status in the Army National Guard\nfrom March 2001 until September 2003. He was recalled to active duty for a deployment\nto Afghanistan in 2003. He also receives a disability benefit for a knee injury he suffered\nafter returning from Afghanistan. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant was married from March 1994 until November 2001, when he and his\nwife divorced. He has one child, age 15, from that marriage. He also has two other\nchildren, ages 17 and 2. (Gx. 1) Each of the children live with their mothers. (Tr. 60)\nApplicant is currently paying child support by garnishment of his pay for the benefit of\nhis children. (Tr. 60 - 61) An earlier arrearage of $571 (SOR 1.n) has been repaid. (Ax.\nD) \nWhen he submitted his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he was more than 90\ndays past due on several debts. The subsequent background investigation showed that,\nas alleged in SOR 1.a - 1.n, he owed approximately $26,139 for at least 14 unpaid\ndebts. (Gx. 2; Gx. 7; Gx. 8) Of those debts, Applicant has paid or otherwise resolved\nmedical debts for $150 (SOR 1.a), $861 (SOR 1.b), and $405 (SOR 1.c) (Tr. 66 - 67;\nAx. J). He has also paid or resolved the $493 unpaid telephone bill alleged at SOR 1.h\n(Ax. B), a $309 debt for an unpaid cable bill alleged at SOR 1.j (Tr. 70; Ax. J), a $1,886\npast due mortgage account alleged at SOR 1.k (Tr. 71; Ax. J), and a $636 debt for an\nunpaid credit card account alleged at SOR 1.m. (Tr. 71 - 72; Ax. J)\nApplicant still owes approximately $20,828 for six debts alleged in SOR 1.d - 1.g,\n1.i, and 1.l. Of those debts, Applicant has enrolled the debts at SOR 1.f, 1.g. 1.i, and 1.l\nin a plan managed by a debt consolidation and repayment company. He entered into an\nagreement with that company sometime in April 2010, but as of the hearing date, he\nhad not yet made any payments into that plan. (Ax. K; Tr. 68, 89) Applicant estimates\nthe balance on the debt alleged at SOR 1.g is actually about $13,418 instead of the\n$8,986 listed in the SOR. (Tr. 69; Ax. J)\n\n4\nApplicant also disclosed in his e-QIP that he has been arrested for or charged\nwith several criminal offenses relating to domestic violence. As of the date of his e-QIP,\nhe was still awaiting trial on two charges \u2013 violation of a protective order and domestic\nviolence / harassment. (Gx. 1) At his hearing, he further disclosed that he was awaiting\ntrial on a new charge of domestic violence alleged to have occurred in December 2009.\n(Tr. 81)\nApplicant\u2019s criminal record stems from his relationship with two women (Girlfriend\n1 and Girlfriend 2) that started around the time of his divorce. Girlfriend 1 has filed\nnumerous charges against the Applicant since 2007. As alleged in SOR 2.a, Applicant\nwas arrested, charged, and convicted in September 2007 of violating a protective order\nobtained by Girlfriend 1. However, the charge arose when Applicant reported for his first\nday at work as required, only to see Girlfriend 1 in the same room at a \u201cwelcome\naboard\u201d presentation. (Ax. A) Two co-workers have corroborated Applicant\u2019s claim that\nhe was required to be at the presentation, and that he did not know Girlfriend 1 worked\nat the same site. (Gx. 2) She reported his presence to company security personnel and\nlater swore out a warrant for his arrest. (Gx. 4) After Applicant\u2019s conviction in district\ncourt, he appealed to the circuit court and requested a jury trial. The case was\ndismissed when Girlfriend 1 told prosecutor\u2019s she would no longer participate in\nprosecution of that case. (Gx. 2; Ax. E)\nThe protective order obtained against Applicant by Girlfriend 1 was originally to\nbe in effect for ten years. She obtained the order in May 2007 after complaining that\nApplicant was calling her and harassing her as alleged in SOR 2.b, something Applicant\nhas denied. In June 2008, Girlfriend 1 asked the court to withdraw the protective order.\n(Gx. 2)\nIn May 2007, before she obtained the protective order alleged in SOR 2.c,\nGirlfriend 1 and Applicant got into an argument when he asked her to return some\nmoney he had given her. He claims he never laid hands on her and that he tried to\nleave, but could not because she had hidden his car keys. Girlfriend 1 called the police,\nand, as alleged in SOR 2.c, Applicant was charged and convicted of domestic violence /\nharassment. Again, when he appealed this conviction to the circuit court, Girlfriend 1 did\nnot cooperate with prosecutors and the charge was dismissed. (Gx. 2; Ax. G)\nApplicant was in a relationship with Girlfriend 1 from 2001 until 2006, but he has\ncontinued to interact with her and, at times, supports her. (Tr. 75 - 77) In December\n2009, she accused him of domestic violence / assault after an altercation at his house.\nThe case is still pending trial. (Tr. 80 - 81) When asked why she was at his house,\nApplicant disclosed that she had been living there for the past two years. (Tr. 82)\nGirlfriend 1 moved out soon after the December 2009 altercation. (Tr. 87 - 88)\nApplicant and Girlfriend 2 have a two-year-old child together. They have been in\nan on-again-off-again relationship since about 2006. However, their relationship has\nsuffered due to the continued contact with Girlfriend 1. In December 2006, Applicant\nand Girlfriend 2 got into an argument at his house. He wanted her to leave, and when\nshe refused, he grabbed her by the arm and forced her from the house. As alleged in\nSOR 1.d, Applicant was charged with 3  degree domestic violence. With the consent of\nrd\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n5\nthe victim, the case was not prosecuted provided he complete an eight-week domestic\nviolence intervention program. Applicant and Girlfriend 2 have a positive relationship,\nand she has vouched for his reliability and trustworthiness. (Gx. 2; Ax. H; Ax. J)\nAs alleged in SOR 1.e, Applicant was also charged with and convicted of\ndomestic violence / harassment in June 1996. He got into an argument with his aunt\nand the police were called. Applicant averred that this was a simple argument that was\na mistake blown out of proportion. (Gx. 2)\nApplicant attributes his money problems to legal fees he has had to pay in\nresponse to the multiple criminal complaints by Girlfriend 1. He estimates he has had to\npay in excess of $10,000 for legal counsel. (Tr. 72) However, he did not present any\nbills from attorneys, he represented himself in response to Girlfriend 1's request for a\nprotective order, and he was represented by a public defender or other court-appointed\ncounsel in response to the charges against him in May 2007 and September 2007. (Ax.\nF; Ax. G)\nApplicant has used debt consolidation and debt counseling firms over the past\ntwo years (Gx. 2; Ax. K), but there is no record that he has made payments on his\nremaining debts through those services. His current finances are further characterized\nby a negative monthly cashflow. (Gx. 2; Ax. J) Applicant\u2019s job performance record is\nexcellent. He is highly regarded by co-workers and his supervisor. (Ax. I; Ax. J) He also\nperformed well while he was in the Army and the National Guard. His military record\ncontains multiple personal awards. (Ax. J)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n6\nin the adjudicative guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n6\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information.\nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a\nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who\n7\nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Government presented information sufficient to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.e. Between 1996 and 2009, Applicant was charged with several criminal\noffenses stemming from domestic altercations that allegedly escalated to some level of\nviolence or harassment. The Government\u2019s information raises a security concern that is\nexpressed at AG \u00b6 30 as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant has admitted that he was at fault in only one of the alleged offenses\n(SOR 2.d). He further relies on the fact that, although he was convicted of the offenses\nalleged through SOR 2.a - 2.c, the charges were dismissed when he appealed and his\naccuser did not testify. He also asserted that the offense alleged in SOR 2.e was a\nmisunderstanding. The ultimate disposition of the charges in question does not negate\nthe security significance of the fact that he was arrested and charged. The disqualifying\nconditions at AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) applies\n\n7\nhere. Further, his conviction on a 3  degree domestic violence charge (SOR 2.d) and\nrd\nhis admission of guilt in that case require application of the disqualifying condition at AG\n31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses).\nI also conclude that available information is not sufficient to support application of\nany of the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b632. Applicant disclosed at the hearing\nthat a new charge of domestic violence was pending against him, so the concerns about\nhis conduct are recent. It may be the case, as Applicant has claimed, that Girlfriend 1 is\naccusing him of these offenses out of spite. However, the most recent charge arose, in\nlarge part, because Applicant allowed his accuser to live in his home for two years.\nApplicant continues to experience legal troubles because he has not acted to change\nhis circumstances. Available information also shows that he has a history of domestic\narguments that escalate into altercations. The burden was on Applicant to show that this\nis no longer the case, but questions about his record of criminal domestic conduct\npersist. On balance, he has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the\nGovernment\u2019s information under this guideline.\nFinancial\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR 1.a - 1.n; that is, that Applicant accrued more than $26,000 in delinquent debt\nsince his divorce in 2000. Although he has paid or resolved several of the debts alleged\nin the SOR, he still owes approximately $20,828 for six debts alleged in SOR 1.d - 1.g,\n1.i, and 1.l. Thus, the record requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\nBy contrast, Applicant has not established that he will be able to repay his\nremaining debts or that his current finances are sufficiently healthy so as to avoid future\nfinancial problems. Further, Applicant claimed that his debts were largely the product of\nfinancial stress brought on by the costs of legal counsel in response to Girlfriend 1's\nfalse criminal charges against him. However, he did not support his claim with any\ncorroborating information. It also appears that he was actually represented at no cost\nthrough public defenders or other court-appointed counsel. All of the information about\nthe cause of his debt indicates it was likely due to his own mismanagement. While he\nhas paid some of his debts, and he has engaged the services of debt consolidation\nfirms, he has not established a track record of sound financial management, or a solid\nplan that shows his financial problems will be resolved in the foreseeable future. All of\nthe foregoing precludes application of any of the Guideline F mitigating conditions under\n\n See footnote 8, supra. \n9\n8\nAG \u00b6 20. Accordingly, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns about his\nfinances. \nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines F and J. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 37 years\nold and is presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. While his record of military\nservice and his on-the-job performance support that presumption, his record of\ndomestic violence and his financial problems undermine such a characterization. The\npositive information about his military and professional experience is insufficient to\novercome the persistent doubts raised by the Government\u2019s information about his\ncriminal conduct and financial problems. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.  \n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j, 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.m, 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security\nclearance is denied.\n                                         \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is granted.\nOn April 9, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions\n(QNSP) to renew a security clearance he has held for about 20 years through the\nmilitary, and which he now requires for his civilian job with a defense contractor. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a set of\ninterrogatories  regarding information in his background. Based on the results of the\n1\nbackground investigation and his response to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nAugust 19, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n3\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nthe national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On\nFebruary 12, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging\nfacts which raise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG)  under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on April 6, 2009. I convened a hearing on April 21, 2009, at which the\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits (Gx. 1 - 4),\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nproffered five exhibits (Ax. A - E), which were admitted without objection. I also left the\nrecord open to allow Applicant time to submit additional relevant information. Applicant\u2019s\npost-hearing submission was timely received and has been admitted without objection\nas Ax. F. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on May 7, 2009.\nProcedural Issue\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged through SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant\nintentionally omitted from his security clearance application relevant information about\nhis finances by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 28 (debts more than 180 days past due in\nthe preceding seven years). Applicant admitted the omission, but he denied any intent\nto falsify or mislead. At the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw this\nallegation. (Tr., 7) Without objection, and in accordance with Directive, E3.1.17, the\nSOR was amended to strike SOR \u00b6 2.a. Accordingly, I have not applied the Guideline E\nadjudicative factors as part of this decision. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged Applicant owes approximately\n$72,000 for ten delinquent or past due financial obligations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j) Applicant\nadmitted, in part, and denied, in part, those allegations. In addition to the facts\nestablished through his admissions, and after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript,\nand exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 42 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nDecember 2007. Prior to that, he served for 21 years in the U.S. Army before retiring\nwith an honorable discharge as a Staff Sergeant. His military service was exemplary, as\nshown by the numerous personal awards and commendations he received. While in the\nArmy, he was primarily assigned as a logistics specialist. He has continued in that line\nof work through his civilian employment. His job performance appears to be excellent as\nshown by his recent receipt of a meritorious pay increase.  (Gx. 1; Ax. D; Tr., 40 - 43)\nApplicant and his wife have been married since September 1989. They have\nthree children, ages 14, 11, and 9. (Gx. 1; Tr., 38) Applicant\u2019s last active duty\n\n After they relocated, his wife was definitively diagnosed with a degenerative neurological disorder, which,\n4\nalthough partially manageable, is eventually terminal.\n3\nassignment was at an Army base in the midwest United States beginning in 2003.\nApplicant and his wife liked the area and financed the purchase of a new-construction\nhome for $161,500. With his wife working full time as a store manager for a national\nretail chain, they were able to meet all of their financial obligations. However, around\n2002 or 2003, she began having undiagnosed physical problems which interfered with\nher ability to work. By 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife became unable to work at all. In 2007,\nApplicant was scheduled to return for a second deployment to Iraq, but the Army\nallowed him to retire instead, effective in February 2008, in view of his wife\u2019s medical\nproblems.\nApplicant was hired by a defense contractor in December 2007 and had to move\nhis family. However, without a second income,  he could not cover the two mortgages\n4\nthey already had on their house and pay rent in their new location. They had to sell their\nhouse or rent it to cover the mortgage. They were unable to do either and the mortgage\nwas eventually foreclosed and the house sold at auction for $138,600. (Gx. 2) Applicant\nstill owes approximately $33,000 on the first mortgage, but it is unclear if this is for the\ndeficiency on his first mortgage after the house was sold at auction, or if it is for a\nbalance past due before the mortgage went into foreclosure. (Gx.  3; Tr., 56 - 57) He\nalso owes nearly $19,000 for the balance of a second mortgage, which was not satisfied\nthrough the sale of the house. (Gx. 3; Tr., 37)\nIn addition to the problems with his mortgage, Applicant also incurred other\ndelinquent debts. In all, credit reports obtained during his background investigation\nshowed Applicant owed approximately $22,434 for eight accounts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.e,\n1.h - 1.j) However, two of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.I) have been removed from his\ncredit history after Applicant showed they were not his. (Answer to SOR; Ax. A; Ax. F;\nTr., 48 - 52, 69 - 71) Applicant has paid four of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1d and 1.j),\nand is paying $200 each month to resolve a fifth (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Ax. A; Ax. F; Tr., 26 - 27,\n37, 48 - 52) Finally, in October 2008, Applicant enrolled in a debt management and\nrepayment plan wherein he originally paid $487 each month to resolve the debts he still\nowes on his foreclosed mortgage and one other delinquent credit account (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e -\n1.g). His monthly payment was reduced to $198 after the erroneous accounts were\nremoved from his credit history. The plan is intended to have his debts paid or resolved\nin three years. (Gx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. F; Tr., 51 - 55, 73)\nApplicant is also trying to resolve the debts related to his mortgage foreclosure\nthrough a DoD assistance program. The Department of Defense Homeowners\nAssistance Program (HAP) is designed to provide financial assistance to military and\nsome DoD civilian employees who have lost money through declining property values\nwhen they have had to sell their houses. Applicant has applied for such benefits and\nsubmitted information about the assistance for which he thinks he will be eligible.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s information (Ax. B) and the information available at the HAP web\npage show that this program is aimed at persons who have had to move because of the\nDoD Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) initiative. If he is eligible for assistance,\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n4\nApplicant expects that his mortgage obligations will be satisfied in whole or in part. He\nalso understands that he will incur a taxable income benefit as a result of any\nassistance or debt forgiveness that may occur. For now, however, he is repaying his\nmortgage-related debts through his debt management and repayment plan. (Tr., 58 -\n60, 73 - 74).\nApplicant earns approximately $5,658 each month from his defense contractor\npay, a disability benefit from an active duty injury, and his Army retired pay. He is\ncurrent on all of his present obligations, such as rent, car notes, and other recurring\nmonthly obligations. After all of his expenses, including the debt repayment plan, are\npaid each month, Applicant estimates that he is able to save about $800. (Ax. F; Tr., 65\n- 69)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n6\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations). \nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n7\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j. The facts thus established show that Applicant owed approximately\n$72,000 in delinquent debts comprised of two delinquent mortgages and numerous\ndelinquent personal credit accounts. The resulting security concern about Applicant\u2019s\nfinances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nMore specifically, the record requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\nBy contrast, Applicant has shown that his financial problems arose from unusual\ncircumstances that were beyond his control. It is likely that, had his wife not become ill,\nhe would have remained in the Army and his family would have remained in the house\nthey eventually lost. He has further demonstrated through a proactive approach to\nresolving his debts, that his financial problems are not indicative of a defect in his\njudgment or reliability. He has paid or resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c,\n1.d, and 1.j. He is making monthly payments on the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and the\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g are being paid off through a debt management\nand repayment plan that Applicant had entered into before the SOR was issued.\nApplicant also has been trying to resolve his mortgage-related debts through a DoD-\nsponsored assistance program; however, it does not appear that he will be eligible to\nparticipate in that program. Even if he does not receive that assistance, he will continue\n\n See footnote 6, supra.\n9\n6\nto pay off the debts left from his foreclosure. As to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1,h, and 1.I,\nApplicant established that those were for credit accounts that were not his, and they\nhave been removed from his credit history. Applicant also showed that his current\nfinances are sound and that he has a sufficient positive monthly cash flow that will allow\nhim to resolve his remaining debts while avoiding future financial difficulties.\nAll of the foregoing requires application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(a)\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) (emphasis added), AG \u00b6 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances), AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol), and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts). On balance, Applicant\u2019s information is sufficient to\nmitigate the Guideline F security concerns established by this record. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 42 years old and,\nthrough his military service and the actions he has taken to resolve his financial\nproblems, has demonstrated he is a mature, responsible adult. He has established that\nhis financial problems represent only a brief portion of his background, and that he did\nnot intentionally or knowingly mismanage his finances. Applicant\u2019s past record of\nintegrity and reliability in his Army service and the good health of his current financial\ncircumstances make it exceedingly unlikely that he will experience such problems in the\nfuture or that he would act contrary to the national interest to resolve his past\ndelinquencies. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information\n9\nbearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows he has mitigated the security concerns raised by\nthe government\u2019s information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance is\ngranted.\n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is granted.\nOn April 22, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his work on\na contract with the Department of Defense. After reviewing the results of the ensuing\nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a set of interrogatories  to obtain clarification of information\n1\nin his background. After reviewing the results of the background investigation together\nwith his response to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a\npreliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\n2\nJuly 8, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nallow Applicant access to classified information. On November 25, 2008, DOHA issued\nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\naddressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline B (foreign influence).\n3\nOn December 9, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a\nhearing. On January 15, 2009, Department Counsel made a pre-hearing submission\nthrough which the government asked that administrative notice be taken of certain facts\ngermane to the issues presented by the pleadings. The submission consisted of a ten-\npage memorandum supported by 24 enclosed documents (Attachments I - XXIV).\nThe case was assigned to me on February 23, 2009, and I convened a hearing\non April 2, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on April 10, 2009. The\nparties appeared at the hearing as scheduled. The government presented two exhibits \u2013\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP (Gx. 1) and his response to interrogatories (Gx. 2). They were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf, presented three\nwitnesses, and proffered six exhibits (Ax. A - F). I admitted into the record Ax. A - E;\nhowever, for reasons discussed at the hearing (Tr. 48 - 53) Ax. F was not admitted. \nI also granted, in part, and denied, in part, the government\u2019s pre-hearing\nadministrative notice request. The entire administrative notice request is included in the\nrecord as Judicial Exhibit (Jx. 1); however, for reasons discussed at the hearing (Tr. 21 -\n25), I have not considered the information contained in Jx. 1, Attachments V - IX and\nXXVI - XXIV.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline B, the government alleged that Applicant\u2019s four brothers, one of\nwhom is a city government employee, are citizens of and reside in the Peoples Republic\nof China (PRC) (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that his in-laws are citizens of and reside in Taiwan (SOR\n\u00b6 1.b); that, while traveling in the PRC for conferences in 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and 2006\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) he visited family members there; that he traveled to Taiwan in 2003 to visit\nfamily members there (SOR \u00b6 1.e); that he traveled to Taiwan in 2001 to get married\nand visit family there (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he also traveled to Taiwan in 2001 to attend a\nRotary Club conference 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); that he traveled to the PRC in 1998 to see\nhis family (SOR \u00b6 1.h); that he worked for the PRC government between 1985 and 1987\n(SOR \u00b6 1.I); and that he worked for the PRC government on a collective farm between\n1972 and 1978 (SOR \u00b6 1.j).\nApplicant admitted with explanation the factual allegations, but he has vigorously\ndenied that the facts established through his admissions make him unsuitable for\naccess to classified information. (Tr., 11 - 12) In addition to the facts established by\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\n\n As to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.j, that he \u201cworked for the Chinese Government Collective Farms,\u201d Applicant\n4\nwryly observed that this is almost like accusing the Jews in the Nazi concentration camps of being working\n(sic) for the Nazi government.\u201d (Tr. 97) \n The trip alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was funded by Applicant\u2019s chapter of the Rotary Club.\n5\n3\nApplicant is 54 years old. He was born and raised in the PRC before coming to\nlive in the United States in 1987. He and his wife, who was born and raised in Taiwan,\nwere married in October 2001. They have two children, ages 3 and 7, who were both\nborn in the United States. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September\n1999. His wife was naturalized in April 2008. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant was educated through high school in state-run Chinese schools. In\n1972, at age 17, he was sent against his will to work on a collective farm away from his\nfamily. He lived and worked there for six years, communicating only sporadically with\nhis family.  In 1978, he applied and was accepted to attend the University of Beijing,\n4\nwhere he studied archaeology. After receiving his degree in that field in 1978, he then\nattended China\u2019s Central University for Nationalities, where he earned a post-graduate\ndegree in anthropology in 1985. From 1985 until 1987, Applicant worked for the state-\nrun Commission for Ethnic and Minority Affairs. His work involved preserving and\nresearching the artifacts and ethnic heritage of China\u2019s several minorities. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2;\nAx. A; Tr., 103 - 105)\nApplicant immigrated to the United States on a student visa in 1987 after he was\naccepted to a university here. He graduated in 1991 with a master\u2019s degree in\nlinguistics. Although he completed his doctoral studies in archaeology, he never\ncompleted his dissertation. Instead, in 1992, he accepted a job as an archaeological\nconsultant near where he currently lives. Around this time, he also started working as a\ntranslator. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Tr., 106 - 112) \nApplicant now owns his own translation company that does business in several\ncountries. His company does business internationally and has been certified for work\nwith the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Information Agency, and the state court\nsystem where he lives. Applicant is also head of the Chinese language division of an\ninternational translators\u2019 association. In 2008, he traveled to the PRC for an\ninternational translators\u2019 conference when it was held there, and visited his family while\nthere. In 2004, he traveled through the PRC and visited family members en route to a\njob as a translator in Bali. He does not stay with family members in either the PRC or\nTaiwan when he travels to those countries. He first returned to the PRC to see his\nfamily in 1998, before he became a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s wife has also traveled to\nthe PRC with him and has been back to Taiwan three times since 2003. While some of\nApplicant\u2019s travel has been incidental to business travel, with one exception,  all of his\n5\nand his wife\u2019s travel has been self-funded. (Gx. 2; Ax. A; Tr., 133 - 144)\nSince about 1995, Applicant has been active in his local chapter of the Rotary\nClub. The Rotary is a volunteer organization of businessmen dedicated to community\nservice. Among their efforts are participation in the Habitat for Humanity, raising funds\nfor polio treatment and education, and international student exchange programs aimed\n\n4\nat improving cultural understanding and promoting world peace through service to\nothers. Applicant has been active in the student exchange program and was selected as\nthe leader for an exchange trip to Taiwan in 2001. It was on this trip that he met his wife,\nherself a former Rotary exchange student between Taiwan and Sweden. He returned\nlater in 2001 to get married. (Tr., 83 - 84 ) \nApplicant has an excellent reputation in his community for service, family values,\nand integrity. In addition to his own business, Applicant has worked to improve\nopportunities for and exposure of Asian-American business development in the U.S. In\n1997, as part of a U.S. Department of Commerce delegation and trade mission, he\naccompanied the Secretary of Commerce to Canada. Witnesses from his neighborhood\nand from his Rotary Club chapter provided information about his active participation in a\nvariety of charitable endeavors. In September 2005, Applicant organized a relief effort\nfor victims of Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf of Mexico coast. A couple who benefitted\nfrom Applicant\u2019s efforts also have vouched for his character and civic leadership. (Tr.,\n116 - 177; Ax. D) A physician who has known Applicant for at least 15 years, spoke\nhighly of Applicant\u2019s patriotism and commitment to his interests in the U.S. He also\nopined, as did Applicant\u2019s other witnesses, that Applicant is apolitical in most matters,\nparticularly when it comes to Sino-U.S. relations. (Tr., 54 - 60) An attorney, who has\nknown Applicant through the Rotary Club for more than seven years, asserted that\nApplicant exemplifies the Rotarian principles of hard work and character. (Tr., 61 - 74)\nAnother fellow Rotarian, a retired Army officer with over 20 years of service, who has\nbelonged to the Rotary Club for more than 25 years, testified that Applicant has been\nrecognized several times for his high level of personal monetary contributions. He also\ntestified that Applicant exemplifies the Rotary Club\u2019s main values of truth, fairness,\ngoodwill and benefit for all. (Tr., 75 - 92)\nApplicant is the oldest of five children, all boys, in his family. Their parents are\nboth deceased. Applicant\u2019s brothers are citizens of and still reside in the PRC in a city\nlocated approximately 800 miles from Beijing. They have not visited Applicant in the\nU.S., but Applicant tries to visit them if possible when he is in the PRC. Applicant\ncommunicates with his brothers by phone about five or six times each year. Aside from\none brother, who is a municipal government employee working as a driver providing\ntransportation to retired city employees, none of his brothers or extended family in\nChina is employed by or has any official ties to the PRC government. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are retired. Her father is a retired Taiwanese military\nofficer on whose pension they rely for subsistence. Applicant thinks he was a major, but\nthere is no information available about when he retired or what his duties in the military\nwere. She speaks to her parents each month by phone, and Applicant\u2019s only contact\nwith them is by phone incidental to his wife\u2019s contact with them. None of Applicant\u2019s or\nhis wife\u2019s family knows of his application for a security clearance. (Tr., 120 - 132)\nApplicant has no financial or other interests in the PRC or Taiwan. While his\nbusiness has grown significantly in the past three years, less than 1% of his total\nbusiness revenues result from work in either country. (Tr., 146 - 152) Applicant is\nfinancially secure in the U.S. through his business income, ownership of two houses,\nand through a variety of retirement and savings accounts. Applicant receives no income\n\n The PRC does not recognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d In 1949, Taiwan was populated\n6\nby refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That same year, Communists in mainland China established the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and a separate, independent government was established in Taiwan. (Jx.\nI, Attachment XII)\n5\nfrom anyone in the PRC or Taiwan and he receives no benefits from either government.\nHe estimates his net worth to be about $350,000. (Gx. 2; Ax. C; Ax. E)\nHaving reviewed the documents received through Department Counsel\u2019s\nRequest for Administrative Notice (Jx. I), I make the following findings of fact regarding\nthe PRC and Taiwan.\nThe PRC is an increasingly industrialized world economic and military power.\nThe country has a population in excess of one billion people who are governed by an\nauthoritarian, Communist regime. Geographically vast and demographically diverse, the\ncountry has significant natural resources to help support its growing economy. The PRC\ndevotes most of its industry and domestic production to its military forces, and it has a\nstrategic nuclear arsenal. (Jx. I, Attachments I, XI) The PRC is in direct competition with\nthe United States in many geopolitical and economic areas, and it is known to actively\ncollect military, economic and industrial information about the United States. (Jx. I,\nAttachments II, IV) In 2007, it was reported to Congress that the PRC was the leading\nthreat to the security of U.S. technology. (Jx. I, Attachment III) \nHowever, the PRC and the U.S. also are major trading partners and share other\ncommon interests. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the two countries\nworked closely in counter-terrorism efforts. The PRC and the U.S. also have worked\nclosely on regional issues, especially those involving North Korea. However, U.S.-PRC\nrelations are sometimes complicated by events in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The PRC is\none of the most active collectors of U.S. defense information and technology.\nThe PRC government has an abysmal human rights record. Officials continue to\nengage in suppression of personal and electronic expressions of political dissent,\narbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and other prisoner\nmistreatment. Government and law enforcement practices are largely unchecked by any\nindependent judicial review. (Jx. I, Attachment X)\nTaiwan is an island nation governed through a multi-part democracy. Since its\nseparation from the mainland Chinese government 60 years ago,  Taiwan has become\n6\nan industrialized economic entity and a leading producer of high-technology goods. In\n1979, the U.S. formally recognized the PRC as the sole legal government of China.\nHowever, the U.S. has maintained cultural, commercial, and military relations with\nTaiwan. Maintaining strong relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. does\nnot officially support Taiwanese independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s\nmembership in international organizations such as the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the Asian\nDevelopment Bank. (Jx. I, Attachment XIII) The U.S. is also committed to help Taiwan\nmaintain its defensive capabilities, and has sold the Taiwanese defensive military\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n7\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n8\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n6\nequipment and weapons, including destroyers, anti-submarine aircraft, and diesel\nsubmarines. (Jx. I, Attachment XIV) Notwithstanding these close ties with the U.S.,\nTaiwan continues to target the U.S., among others, as part of its long-standing use of\naggressive economic and information espionage activities. (Jx. I, Attachment XV)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,7\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 6, Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n8\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n9\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n10\n7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.10\nAnalysis\nForeign Influence. \nThe facts established by the government\u2019s information and by Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions raise security concerns about Applicant\u2019s personal relationships and other\ninterests in the PRC and Taiwan. Specifically, as stated in AG \u00b6 6, \n[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAs to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.j, that Applicant was employed by the PRC when\nhe was forced to leave home and work on a collective farm from 1972 until 1978, I find\nfor the Applicant. It is absurd to characterize Applicant has having entered into an\nemployee-employer relationship with the PRC at that time. This is in stark contrast to\nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i, that he was a government employee in the PRC\u2019s Ethnic\nand Minority Affairs ministry after he graduated from college in the mid-1980s. However,\nit is unlikely that an official tie to the PRC government that ended more than 20 years\nago may now form the basis for undue pressure or coercion in furtherance of the PRC\u2019s\nefforts against U.S. interests. I find for the Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 1.i.\nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant has close family ties to his brothers\nin the PRC and, by virtue of his close relationship with his wife, to her family in Taiwan.\nAs to those family members in Taiwan, that country\u2019s known targeting of U.S. economic,\ntechnical and military information presents a risk of exploitation; however, the risk may\nbe countered, or at least diminished by the fact that Taiwan is an open society governed\nby democratically-elected officials. Nor does the Taiwanese government present human\nrights abuse issues that might suggest unchecked government pressure or influence on\nits citizens. The concerns about Applicant\u2019s brothers in the PRC are a different matter.\n\n The travel to Taiwan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g occurred before Applicant had any ties to that country. Moreover,\n11\nApplicant made that trip as part of an international service and student exchange mission with the Rotary Club.\nAs such, it is not evidence of any foreign ties or influence. SOR \u00b6 1.g is concluded for the Applicant.\n8\nThe PRC is in direct geopolitical competition with the U.S., and is known to conduct\neconomic, military and technical espionage in the U.S. Combined with its repressive\nform of government and unhindered abuse of human rights within its borders, the\nconcerns about the presence of an applicant\u2019s family in the PRC are well-founded.\nWhile the government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s foreign travel (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.f,\nand 1.h)  is not by itself disqualifying, it is evidence of the influence of his relationship\n11\nwith his family in China and Taiwan. The foregoing requires application of the\ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion). \nOf the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 8, only AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign  individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), AG\n\u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest), and AG \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation) are potentially applicable to these facts. \nAs to \u00b6 AG 8(a), the presence in the PRC of Applicant\u2019s brothers, to whom\nApplicant is undoubtedly close, precludes use of this mitigating condition. There is also\na rebuttable presumption that, because Applicant is close to his wife he is also close to\nher family. Nor is application of AG \u00b6 8(c) supported by these facts. Applicant\u2019s close\nrelationship with his brothers and his in-laws, combined with his regular phone contact\nwith at least one of his brothers and his wife\u2019s regular phone contact with her parents do\nnot allow a conclusion that the contact with family is casual or infrequent.\nHowever, as to AG \u00b6 8(b), Applicant has presented sufficient information to show\nthat his interests, relationships and loyalties in the U.S. are so well-entrenched that he is\nlikely to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Since the time he arrived in\nthe U.S. as a graduate student more than 20 years ago, Applicant has not just\nassimilated into the fabric of U.S. society, he has done so in a high profile and all-\nencompassing way. The information contained in Ax. A reflects a complete\n\u201cAmericanization\u201d of this immigrant. All of his interests \u2013 his wife and children, his\nbusiness, his finances and property, and his identity as a citizen \u2013 are inextricably\nrooted in the United States and its society. The cross-section of information that\nsupports application of AG \u00b6 8(b) and reflects well on his character and integrity, also\n\n See footnote 7, supra.\n12\n9\noutweighs the security concerns about his family ties in the PRC and Taiwan. I conclude\nGuideline B for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline B. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a mature,\nresponsible, and highly accomplished 55-year-old businessman who, since arriving in\nthe U.S. in 1987, has worked diligently to succeed in business and to better the\ncommunity in which he lives. The circumstances of his family ties in the PRC and\nTaiwan are not likely to change. However, the ties he has established in the U.S.\nthrough the Rotary Club, and through his myriad other business-related and civic\nactivities make it highly unlikely that he would act contrary to U.S. interests in response\nto pressure by any foreign government. Certainly, there has been no misconduct here\nand there is nothing inappropriate or illegal about Applicant\u2019s contacts overseas. A fair\nand commonsense assessment  of all available information shows Applicant has\n12\novercome the doubts about his suitability under these circumstances.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 2.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest for\nApplicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is granted.\nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 21, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Activity) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 25, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant  appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\ndefense contractor.  He attended college but has not yet earned a degree.  In 2004 he was arrested and\ncharged with numerous offenses involving illegal drugs and explosive devices.  He pled guilty to one\ncount of \u201ccontrolled dangerous substance (CDS), manufacture and distribute;\u201d and one count of\n\u201cdestructive device, manufacture, possession, and distribution.\u201d  Decision at 2.

However, a party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant stated that, at the time of his arrest, he was conducting scientific experiments at\nhis home which involved over-the counter medications often used to produce illegal drugs.  He\nstated that his purpose was to devise a cold medication that could not serve as a basis for the\nmanufacture of illegal drugs.  He also stated that he was attempting to develop a transponder to assist\nin the recovery of amateur-fired rockets as well as an \u201celectromagnetic field resistant blasting cap.\u201d\nDecision at 3.  As a consequence he had in his possession materials that could have been used to\ndevelop explosives.  Applicant testified that he never intended to do anything wrong and that he pled\nguilty to the offenses in question due to the prohibitive expense of defending himself in a litigated\ntrial.  A review of the record demonstrates that the Judge took into account Applicant\u2019s testimony\nand other matters which he presented in his own behalf, including evidence of his good job\nperformance.  However, he also noted that, at the close of the record, Applicant had not advised his\nemployer of his criminal convictions, with a consequence that he might be subject to coercion.\nMoreover, the Judge noted that Applicant admitted, inter alia, \u201cthat he may actually have\nmanufactured methamphetamine.\u201d  Id at 6-7.  The entirety of the record evidence left the Judge with\n\u201cquestions and doubts\u201d as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.  Id. at 9.   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn November 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 30, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 10, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 11, 2008, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 9, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nMarch 25, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through G, which were received without objection. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit additional information. Applicant \nsubmitted four documents which were marked AE H through K, and admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 17, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDiscovery and Notice \n \nApplicant stated that he never received a copy of Department Counsel\u2019s \ndiscovery package, which included copies of the Government\u2019s exhibits. He also stated \nthat he did not receive a copy of the notice of hearing. I advised Applicant of his right \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. I also advised \nApplicant that because he did not receive copies of the Government\u2019s exhibits until the \nmorning of the hearing that I would postpone the case for at least several weeks. \nApplicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice or a continuance, and \nrequested to hold the hearing on March 9, 2009.   \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing the dates in all the \nallegations from \u201cDecember 4, 2007\u201d to \u201cDecember 7, 2004.\u201d Applicant did not object to \nthe amendment and it was granted. Applicant was asked if he desired additional time to \naddress the allegations as amended. He affirmatively waived his right to additional time \nand stated that he wanted the hearing to proceed that day.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He attended college \nfor a number of years but has not yet earned a degree. He is divorced, with no \nchildren.1  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on December 7, 2004, and charged with controlled \ndangerous substance (CDS), manufacture and distribute; destructive device, \nmanufacture, possession, and distribution; narcotics production/equipment; CDS \npossession not marijuana; firearm/drug trafficking; possession explosive/incendiary with \nintent; explosive possession without license; and four counts of destructive device, \nmanufacture/possess/distribute. He pled guilty to CDS, manufacture and distribute; and \ndestructive device, manufacture, possession, and distribution. The remaining charges \nwere Nolle Prosequi (dismissed). For the first charge, he was sentenced to 20 years \nconfinement, with all but 29 days suspended, given credit for 29 days time served, and \nplaced on probation for five years. He was sentenced to 20 years confinement on the \nsecond charge with all the confinement suspended. He is not required to report to a \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 48-49, 73, 92-93; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nprobation officer. His probation is scheduled to run through July 2010. Once Applicant \nhas completed his probation, the state has agreed to not oppose the court striking the \nguilty findings and imposing Probation Before Judgment for the charges, which would \nnegate the conviction. He could then move to expunge his record.2 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he did not feel that he was guilty of any offense, but he \naccepted the plea bargain because his attorney told him that it would cost about \n$40,000 to fight the case, and he did not have the money. He explains the \ncircumstances leading to his arrest and conviction as follows. Applicant has been \nfascinated with science since he was a child. His hero was the noted scientist and \ninventor, Nikola Tesla, who accomplished most of his work in his home laboratory. \nApplicant studied physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering in college and obtained \nhis dream job of working in a research laboratory. He held a security clearance without \nincident during his employment at the laboratory. After about ten years of working in the \nlaboratory, he became very ill and lost the job in about 2000. He was out of work for \nseveral years. He started conducting experiments at a makeshift laboratory he built in \nhis townhouse and yard.3   \n \n \nApplicant became interested in how easy it was to make illegal drugs, specifically \nmethamphetamine, from over-the-counter cold medications. He began to experiment \nwith the cold medications. His stated purpose was to alter the chemical composition of \nthe active ingredient so that it could not be synthesized into methamphetamine. He \nstated he had a couple packages of the cold medication when he was arrested. \nApplicant was asked if he had actually manufactured any methamphetamine in his lab. \nHe stated he was not certain because he attempted to chemically change the substance \nso that what was produced was not methamphetamine, but his experiment may have \nbeen unsuccessful and methamphetamine could have been produced.4 \n \n \nApplicant denied that he was attempting to make explosives, but he admitted that \nmany chemicals can be combined to create an explosion. He stated that he was careful \nto keep any chemicals that could have an explosive reaction separated. He admitted \nthat he was interested in amateur rockets, known as \u201ccandy rockets.\u201d The fuel for the \nrockets is sugar and \u201csaltpeter.\u201d He stated that he was working on a transponder for the \nrockets so that the rockets could be located after they came down. He also had about \n1,000 empty blasting caps. He was attempting to create an electromagnetic field (EMF) \nresistant blasting cap.5 \n \n \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 55-56, 80-89; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE E, H. \n \n3 Tr. at 49-51, 74-76, 81-82, 93-95; GE 1, 3. \n \n4 Tr. at 51-53, 59-60. \n \n5 Tr. at 53-62, 80-81; GE 1, 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he will never again conduct laboratory experiments outside \nthe confines of an approved lab. Any outside research will be conducted purely \ntheoretically.6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer is not aware of his criminal record. He stated that the \ncompany did not ask about his criminal record. He stated that if the company ever asks, \nhe will tell them about his record. He listed his criminal record on his Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) signed on April 11, 2008.7 \n \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by friends, co-workers, and supervisors. He is \nregarded as an exceptional scientist and engineer, who is a hard worker, dependable, \nreliable, trustworthy, and honest. His performance appraisals have been excellent. He \nhas received numerous awards and has been recognized by his company as employee \nof the year. He has published several scientific publications. He is active in his church \nand is a frequent volunteer.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 65, 68, 70, 94. \n \n7 Tr. at 66-68; GE 1. \n \n8 AE A-D, F, G, I-K. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant was arrested in December 2004, and charged with numerous felony \noffenses. Through a plea bargain, he pled guilty to, and was convicted of, controlled \ndangerous substance, manufacture and distribute; and destructive device, manufacture, \npossession, and distribution. He was sentenced to 20 years confinement, with all but his \n\n \n6 \n \ntime served suspended. He was placed on probation for five years, which is scheduled \nto run through July 2010. The evidence is sufficient to raise all of the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) through (d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred more than four years ago. He pled guilty to \ntwo serious offenses. All of his 20-year-sentence, except for the 29 days he served \nbefore the trial, has been suspended. His probation runs through July 2010. With his \nlong confinement sentence suspended, Applicant faces the potential of lengthy prison \ntime for any probation violation. This is Applicant\u2019s only criminal record. I find that his \ncriminal behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 32(a) is partially applicable. I am unable to \nfind full mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a) because Applicant remains on probation. I also find \nthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse, higher education, good employment record, and \nconstructive community involvement. AG \u00b6 32(d) is applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally violated the law. He stated that he pled \nguilty because he could not afford the estimated $40,000 that it would cost to plead not \nguilty and fully contest the charges. The doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents me from \nfinding that he did not commit the offenses.9 Furthermore, Applicant has admitted that \n                                                          \n9 The Appeal Board has addressed the doctrine of collateral estoppel:  \nIt is well-settled that, with narrow exceptions not applicable in this case, an applicant is \ncollaterally estopped from contending that he or she did not engage in the criminal acts \nfor which he or she was convicted. Collateral estoppel applies to a criminal conviction \nwhether the conviction is based on a verdict after trial or based on a guilty plea. Due \nprocess of law does not give an applicant the right to relitigate matters that have been \nadjudicated in a prior due process proceeding. Federal and state criminal proceedings \nare entitled to be given full recognition and respect under the doctrine of collateral \nestoppel because they are conducted under procedural and evidentiary requirements that \nexceed those applicable to industrial security clearance cases, and must satisfy Federal \n\n \n7 \n \nhe may have actually manufactured methamphetamine. He admitted that he had \nchemicals that when combined would be explosive and he admitted he had about 1,000 \nempty blasting caps. He did not submit sufficient evidence for a finding that he is \ninnocent of the criminal offenses, even without the constraints of the collateral estoppel \ndoctrine. AG \u00b6 32(c) is not applicable to the offenses to which Applicant was convicted. \nIt is applicable to the charges that were dismissed. He was not pressured or coerced \ninto committing the criminal acts. AG \u00b6 32(b) is not applicable.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct was also alleged under the Criminal Conduct \nguideline, as addressed above. His employer is not aware of his criminal record. He is \non probation until July 2010, and he has a suspended 20-year-sentence hanging over \nhis head. His criminal conduct has made him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, \nand duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nand state constitutional requirements of due process that pay special attention to the \nrights of criminal defendants. Furthermore, DOHA Administrative Judges and this Board \nlack the jurisdiction and authority to pass judgment on the proceedings and decisions in \ncriminal cases conducted by Federal and state courts. \nIn this case, Applicant entered a guilty plea to a felony drug charge as part of a plea \nagreement. Applicant's guilty plea constituted an admission that he committed the acts \ncovered by the criminal charge to which he pleaded guilty. Applicant's motivation for \nentering the guilty plea is irrelevant to its legal effect. Having gained the benefits of a plea \nbargain, it is inequitable for Applicant to seek to retain the benefits of that plea bargain \nand then turn around and seek to repudiate his guilty plea and its legal effect in these \nproceedings.  \n(internal citations and footnotes omitted) ISCR Case No. 99-0116 at 2 (App. Bd. May 1, 2000). \n\n \n8 \n \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nThe discussion under the guideline for Criminal Conduct is equally appropriate \nfor this guideline. AG \u00b6 17(c) is partially applicable under the same rationale that I found \nAG \u00b6 32(a) to be partially applicable. His criminal behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 \n17(d) is applicable. Applicant has fully revealed his criminal conduct to the Department \nof Defense. He has taken some steps to reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. However, he is on probation under the threat of a suspended \n20-year-sentence, and his company is completely unaware of his criminal record. He \nremains vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is partially \napplicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n9 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 43 years old. He is a \nhighly regarded scientist and engineer. Clearly science is his life. When he was out of \nwork for an extended period, he started experimenting in his townhouse. He chemically \naltered \nover-the-counter \ncold \nmedications \nthat \nare \nused \nto \nmanufacture \nmethamphetamine. He stated his intent was not to manufacture methamphetamine, but \nto change the chemical composition of the ingredient in the medication so that \nmethamphetamine could not be produced from the medication. He admitted that he may \nhave actually manufactured methamphetamine in the process. He also admitted that he \nhad about 1,000 empty blasting caps and chemicals that when combined could be \nexplosive. He pled guilty to controlled dangerous substance, manufacture and \ndistribute; and destructive device, manufacture, possession, and distribution. Applicant\u2019s \nactions were either that of a man who is very bright, but extremely na\u00efve; or someone \nwho was attempting something much more nefarious. In either event, his actions \nconstituted serious criminal violations.  \n \n \nApplicant is on probation until July 2010, under the threat of a suspended 20-\nyear-sentence. His company is completely unaware of his criminal record. While I find \nthat Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is unlikely to recur, he is vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress.  In sum, I conclude that security concerns are still present \ndespite the presence of some mitigation.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He and his wife had difficulty managing credit cards in the past few years due in part to his unemployment from November 2006 until January 2007. He did acknowledge that he wanted to provide for his family and perhaps did not use his credit as wisely as he should have (Tr. 15). Applicant did not have any financial difficulties or delinquent accounts until 2007. During an earlier time period, he attempted to finance several business ventures with his credit. He unsuccessfully set up a medical claims service, a greeting card sales distribution, and a pharmaceutical sales business (Tr. 29). He estimates that he lost approximately $20,000 when these businesses failed (Tr. 16). His bills continued to increase and he had no extra cash reserves or savings to pay off the credit amount.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 27,\n2008. On October 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 13, 2008. He\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nDecember 16, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 11, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 4, 2009. The Government offered\nExhibits (Ex.) 1-3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own\nbehalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A-F, which were admitted into the record. I held the\nMarch 23, 2009\n\n2\nrecord open until March 18, 2009 for any documents that Applicant wished to submit.\nApplicant submitted five documents, which were marked as AE G, H, I, J, and K and\nadmitted without objection. The record closed on March 18, 2009. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on March 13, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 11, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1. e of the SOR. He provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\ncollege in 1978, and received a graduate degree in 1986. He served in the United\nStates Air Force (USAF) from July 1978 until August 1998 (Tr. 13). Applicant has\nworked for his current employer since January 2007 (GE 1). He has held a security\nclearance since 1978.\nApplicant is married and has four children. He and his wife had difficulty\nmanaging credit cards in the past few years due in part to his unemployment from\nNovember 2006 until January 2007. He did acknowledge that he wanted to provide for\nhis family and perhaps did not use his credit as wisely as he should have (Tr. 15).\nApplicant did not have any financial difficulties or delinquent accounts until 2007. \nDuring an earlier time period, he attempted to finance several business ventures\nwith his credit. He unsuccessfully set up a medical claims service, a greeting card sales\ndistribution, and a pharmaceutical sales business (Tr. 29). He estimates that he lost\napproximately $20,000 when these businesses failed (Tr. 16). His bills continued to\nincrease and he had no extra cash reserves or savings to pay off the credit amount. He\nearned approximately $5,000 less when he was re-employed in 2007 (Tr.16). He could\nno longer operate under his existing budget. He paid on his accounts but the amounts\ncovered interest only. He was living paycheck to paycheck. He decided that he did not\nwant to file for bankruptcy. \nThe SOR alleged 5 delinquent debts. The total amount of delinquent debt was\n$73,000. Applicant admitted that the accounts in allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e are\ndelinquent accounts. \nApplicant retained a debt solution company to help resolve his debts. He entered\ninto a debt solution plan on May 3, 2007 which included two accounts that were not\nalleged in the SOR (AE B). At the same time and upon their advice, he stopped paying\nhis creditors. The company advised that they would arrange the settlements. After he\npaid the initial fee ($11,253.60), he saved funds to settle his accounts. He also\nborrowed money from his brother in February 2009 to enable him to settle all the\ndelinquent accounts (AE ). He used approximately $14,000 of that loan to settle\n\n3\naccounts and put the rest ($34,015) into a special savings account to pay remaining\nbills (Tr. 39).\nApplicant has settled the following seven accounts: Chase Bank ($2,660); GE\nMoney Bank/Arrow ($3,500); Dillards ($2,031.15); Capitol One ($2,000); Bank of\nAmerica ($14,300); Washington Mutual ($2,000); and Discover ($16,021). The company\nis in the final phase of settling another Capitol One (pending amount). The seven\naccounts were settled between November 30, 2007 and March 17, 2009 (AE K).\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $10,956. This includes his military\nretirement and his wife\u2019s income. Under his miscellaneous expenses, he has allocated\n$1,520 for an additional payment on his debt. He is also saving $500 a month and\npaying on a promissory note to his brother ($1,000 a month) (AE E). He is current on his\nmonthly expenses and other credit cards. His credit bureau report lists various accounts\nas \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d\nApplicant now lives in a more frugal fashion. He and his family have not taken\nany vacations nor spent money on anything other than essentials. He took a second job\nas a substitute teacher (AE G). He also plans to umpire during baseball season to\nsupplement his income (Tr. 34).\nApplicant\u2019s employer highly recommends him for retention of his security\nclearance. He is punctual, dependable and has a positive attitude. Applicant has a\nstrong commitment to his company and a desire to do his job well. He has the country\u2019s\nbest interest at heart (AE G ).\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor describes him as one of his most dependable\nworkers. He is the first to volunteer for additional hours to accomplish the mission. He\nworks on detailed, fast paced, must succeed contracts. Applicant would never do\nanything to jeopardize the Nation\u2019s security (AE I).\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Applicant\u2019s company describes him as an\noutstanding employee (AE H). The company is aware of the credit problems. They are\nalso aware of his payments and intent to repay each creditor in full.\nApplicant\u2019s military performance reports rate him as an outstanding leader. He\nmentored young flight commanders and ensured that over 720 aircrew members\nreceived the proper training to safely accomplish missions. He managed a $1.2 million\nannual budget. He distinguished himself in various assignments and is the recipient of\nThe Meritorious Service Medal (Second Oak Leaf Cluster) (AE J).  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts. He\nadmits that since 2007 he has owed $73,000 in delinquent debts. He could not meet his\nfinancial obligations on credit accounts. His credit reports confirm that he has recent\ndebts as well. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in late 2006 in part from failed businesses. He also accumulated\nsome delinquent debt due to an admitted overuse of credit cards and unemployment in\n2006. More importantly, an individual\u2019s decision to operate a business, even if it fails, is\nnot evidence of bad judgment, unreliability, or untrustworthiness but shows intitative.\nThis potentially mitigating condition partially applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant reported that he was unemployed in 2006 for a period of months. He also\nacknowledged that he had several failed business ventures that he attempted with his\ncredit cards. While those circumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry\ndoes not end at that point. He has actively addressed and resolved seven of eight\ndelinquent accounts. He borrowed money from his brother recently to help settle\naccounts. While this is new debt, his recent behavior with creditors does not cast doubt\non his judgment or current reliability. When he became gainfully employed, he did act\n\n6\nresponsibly in identifying and resolving these debts through a debt resolution plan. I find\nthis mitigating condition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling but\nentered into a debt solution program in 2007. This program gave him financial advice.\nHe has a budget. He has settled seven of eight delinquent accounts. His recent actions\nwith creditors has shown financial reform and resolution of debts. I conclude these\nmitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude the mitigating\nconditions and the whole person are sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant has held a security clearance for more than 30 years without incident. He\nretired from the USAF as a Lt. Colonel after 20 years of service. He has spent the last\nten years in government contract positions that require a security clearance. He is\nhighly recommended by his employer for retention of a security clearance.\nHe admitted that he has not used credit wisely in trying to provide the best for his\nfamily. He acknowledged that he used credit for convenience and for purchases of\nthings that he really could not afford at the time. When he became unemployed in 2006,\nhe could only pay minimum payments. He also used his credit card to finance several\nbusiness ventures that failed. He believes this accounts for about $20,000 of debt. He\nfound that he was living paycheck to paycheck. He took immediate action as soon as he\nrecognized the financial difficulties. In 2007, he contacted a debt consolidation company\nrather than file bankruptcy. Upon their advice, he stopped making payments on his\ncredit cards. He entered into an agreement with the company for settlement of his debt.\n\n7\nHe has settled seven accounts, and one account is near settlement. He borrowed\nmoney from his brother recently. While he has taken on a new debt, his brother does\nnot expose him to the same vulnerability or high interest rate that a commercial lender\nwould. \nApplicant has changed his attitude toward credit and his lifestyle. He has not\nmade any unnecessary purchases. He is current on his mortgage and other daily\nexpenses. He and his family have not taken any vacations. He took a second job. His\nwife is working. He has dedicated his entire life to serving his country and protecting \nApplicant did not want to file for bankruptcy. He chose to use a debt\nmanagement company which is a costly method. He paid $11,000 in fees to the\ncompany. He followed their advice. He has made good-faith efforts to pay all his\ndelinquent debt. He was paying all his debt until 2007. At no time was he trying to avoid\npaying his creditors. He was active in resolving his delinquent debt before he became\nunemployed n 2006. \nAt the hearing, Applicant was candid and straightforward in his testimony. He\nwas very well organized and documented his initial attempts to recognize and resolve\nhis debt. He took responsibility for his poor financial decisions in the past. He had some\nunforeseen events which contributed to his financial problems. To help pay his debts,\nhe has taken on a second job to supplement his income. He has shown resolve and\ndetermination to live within a budget. His many prior years of sound financial judgment\noutweigh the concerns about the 2007 delinquent debt. He has changed his lifestyle\nand his thinking about credit.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\n\n8\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On April 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn April 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nDOHA received the request and assigned the case to me on August 5, 2009. On August\n27, 2009, a Notice of Hearing scheduled the hearing for September 30, 2009. The\nhearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted five exhibits (GE)\n1-5, without objection. Applicant did not present any documents. He testified on his own\nbehalf. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 8, 2009. Based upon a review of\nNovember 9, 2009\n\n2\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.m of the SOR. He did not admit the allegation in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1985, and attended college for two years. He served in the U.S. Army\nfrom 1986 until 1987(Tr. 34). Applicant\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce in 1994. He\nremarried in 1999, and has two children from his second marriage (GE 1). He has\nworked for his current employer since August 2006, but he has worked steadily since\nhigh school (Tr. 21).\nIn 2005, Applicant suffered financial difficulties after Hurricane Katrina. He left the\nstate and lived with relatives. He and his wife returned several months later. In 2007,\nApplicant\u2019s wife left him and took their son with her. Her income which contributed to the\nfamily household, was lost. Applicant had several months of unemployment (Tr. 23).\nApplicant\u2019s wife promised to pay for the delinquent debts that occurred during the\nmarriage (Tr. 71; GE 2). She has not done so. Applicant firmly believes she is\nresponsible for paying them. After the 2007 separation, Applicant\u2019s wife continued to\ncharge items on the accounts (Tr. 79).\nApplicant suffered a heart attack in 2007. He also has medical issues relating to\nhigh blood pressure (Tr. 55). Applicant acknowledged that some of the bills were\ndelinquent before 2005 (Tr. 54). He acknowledged that he fell behind in paying his bills\ndue to his wife\u2019s part-time work and the several weeks of unemployment that he had\nover the years. He contacted some of the creditors, but claimed that many went out of\nbusiness after Katrina. He states that he has not received any bills from them.\nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, including medical accounts. The\napproximate total for Applicant\u2019s debts is $30,000 (GE 3). The current status of\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows:\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for a cell phone in the amount of $342.\nApplicant has not paid the account.\nApplicant states the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b is $4,000 for another cell phone\naccount. He states that the account is closed. He claims the bill is in his wife\u2019s name (Tr.\n41). \nApplicant states the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a medical bill for $143 and that it\nwas paid by insurance (Tr. 43). \n\n3\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $1,500 is a collection account for a credit\naccount. According to Applicant, this account was paid in 2008 (Tr. 43). He did not\nprovide any documentation.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $600 is for another cell phone account.\nApplicant could not contact them. The bill is unpaid. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $7,540 is unknown to Applicant (Tr. 47).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is for $2,409. This is a credit card account. He\nmade attempts to pay, but he has not received a bill (Tr. 48). The account remains\nunpaid.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a credit card account for $2,877. This account\nwas for home repairs. Applicant contacted the company, but he has not made any\npayments (Tr. 48).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is an automobile repossession of his wife\u2019s car.\nThe 2004 vehicle was repossessed in 2007, after Applicant and his wife separated. He\nbelieves the amount of $8,341 is not accurate (Tr. 49). He has not paid the account as\nhe believes his wife will do so. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j is for a phone bill in the amount of $362. Applicant\ndoes not recognize this account. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k for $20 is a medical account for a medical visit for\nhis wife. It is unpaid. Applicant stated that his wife agreed to pay the amount (Tr. 50).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l is a past due account in the amount of $836.\nApplicant believes this belongs to his wife (Tr. 50). He believes she has made some\npayments on the account.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m is for a collection account in the amount of $781.\nApplicant states this is an account that his wife opened. He believes she has paid $200\non the account (Tr. 51).\nApplicant earns approximately $35,000 a year. His net monthly income is\napproximately $1,300 (Tr. 38). He is current with his monthly expenses. He pays\nmonthly child support of $680. His two cars are paid for. His net monthly remainder is\napproximately $200. He has a savings account (GE 2). He has no credit cards (Tr. 64).\nHe receives approximately $800 a month in rent from a house that he owns (Tr. 25). He\nestimates that over the past three years he has paid $1,500 on delinquent accounts (Tr.\n57). He hopes to use his income tax refund to pay more creditors (Tr. 27).\nApplicant completed his May 6, 2008 security clearance application. In that\napplication he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 28a concerning financial delinquencies in the\n\n4\nlast seven years over 180 days, and \u201cNo\u201d to question 28b concerning financial\ndelinquencies over 90 days (GE 1). Applicant\u2019s wife helped him with the application. He\norally answered the questions and she filled out the application. She made a mistake by\nanswering the question in the negative (Tr. 67). He believed the form was very\ncomplicated. He relied on her help to complete the application (Tr. 14). Since his wife\nwas a teacher and used to completing paper work, Applicant thought it best for his wife\nto actually complete the application. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n5\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on many accounts for a\nperiod of time. His credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\nacknowledged that he and his wife had delinquent debts before Hurricane Katrina. He\nacknowledged that they were both working. He has not paid any of the accounts. This\nmitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ I find this a factor for\nconsideration in this case. As noted above, the separation that occurred in 2007\nimpacted Applicant financially. Also, Katrina exacerbated the Applicant\u2019s financial\nsituation. In addition, Applicant has some unemployment. However, he has not acted\nresponsibly in paying his accounts.\n\n6\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling. He has not\nresolved the delinquent accounts. He relied on his wife\u2019s promise to pay the accounts.\nHis efforts are insufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude these mitigating\nconditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that he did not\nbelieve he owed some accounts. He provided no documentation for this assertion. I\nconclude this mitigating condition applies in part.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2008 security application, he did not\nanswer \u201cyes\u201d to questions 28a or 28b. He denied the allegation concerning a\nfalsification of his answers. At the hearing, he stated that he answered the questions to\nthe best of his ability and did not know about the incorrect answers. His wife helped him\ncomplete the application because he found it confusing. He incorrectly answered the\nquestion but he did not intentionally falsify his application. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the Government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as whole to determine whether there is direct or\n\n7\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in\nISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). Thus, AG \u00b6 16(a) does not\napply in this case. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.a.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant has worked all his life. He supported his\nfamily. He was in the military. Separation and Katrina was the partial cause of the\ndelinquent accounts. He has not acted responsibly in handling the delinquent debts. He\nacknowledged that he had some delinquent debts before his separation and Katrina.\nHe answered question 28a concerning financial delinquencies in the last 7 years to the\nbest of his ability. He did not intentionally falsify his SF 86.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under financial consideration\nguideline. He has mitigated the concerns under the personal conduct guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraphs 1.a:  1.m:\nAGAINST Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 15, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 9, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2009. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on July 31, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nSeptember 2, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant did \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nnot object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough D, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open until \nSeptember 9, 2009, to allow Applicant time to submit additional documents, which he \ndid. They were marked as AE E through H. The Government had no objections and the \ndocuments were admitted and the record closed.1 DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on September 10, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old and works as an Information Systems Specialist for a \nfederal contractor. He served in the Marine Corps from 1987 to 1993, and was \nhonorably discharge in the pay grade of E-4. He married in 1991, and has three sons, \nages 22, 21, and 16.  \n \n \nApplicant had difficulties transitioning from military employment to civilian \nemployment in 1993. His wife was not working when he was discharged. He worked in \nthe security field upon his discharge and then from 1994 to 2001, he was a truck driver. \nHe was laid off in 2001. He worked for a realty company doing information technology \nuntil 2005. He was again laid off and toward the end of 2005, he and his family \nrelocated to another state where he thought the cost of living was lower and it would be \neasier to get a job. It took approximately three to four months for him to find \nemployment, which he did in 2006. He continued working in the information technology \nfield until January 2007. His mother-in-law was sick and a decision was made to \nrelocate to where she was living. He left his job and did not find employment until he \nwas hired by his current employer in April 2007.2  \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife inherited her childhood home. Applicant and his wife \nrefinanced the home. When he was laid off, they filed for bankruptcy to save the home \nfrom being foreclosed. The bankruptcy was later dismissed and he stated they took a \nloss on the property. He stated that when they refinanced the home, the mortgage \ncompany would only provide them with checks made out to their creditors. The checks \ntotaled $65,000. He could not figure out how to contact the creditors to give them the \nchecks. He brought the checks to the hearing. The mortgage company later went out of \nbusiness and the checks were no longer valid. He stated these checks were to be used \nto pay his creditors.3 \n \n \n \nFrom 2001 to 2005, Applicant was enrolled in college classes. He was working \nfull-time during this period. He took out student loans to pay for his tuition. The debts in \n \n1 HE I. \n \n2 Tr. 19-23, 57-68. \n \n3 Tr. 20-22, 34-40, 54-57. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nSOR 1.a and 1.b are his student loans. The loans were deferred while Applicant was \nattending school. He did not contact the loan company when he stopped school or was \nexperiencing financial problems. They are in a default status. He has not made any \npayments on his student loan debts (total amount alleged $44,833). It is noted that for a \nperiod of time, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished for his student loans. He is not sure \nwhen the garnishment started or how many payments he made. The garnishment \nstopped in August 2009. It is unclear what the current amount owed is on the student \nloans. He stated he always intended to pay the loans and several months ago his wife \ncontacted the creditor, but they are waiting for them to call back. He stated he was busy \nworking and could not contact the creditors. Applicant provided a post-hearing \nstatement saying he is prepared to negotiate making payments on this account.4 \n \nIn February 2007, Applicant\u2019s youngest son was in an accident and was injured. \nApplicant believes some of the bills alleged on the SOR are for his medical bills. He \ndoes not know this for certain. He has not paid the bills. His son recently received an \ninsurance settlement check for $10,000. Applicant hopes to use that money to pay \nsome of the medical bills. Two medical debts (presumably \u00b6 1.g for $376; the other \namount is $100, but it is unclear which debt on the SOR it pertains to.) are included in \nhis debt consolidation plan.5  \n \n \nApplicant was aware that his debts could negatively affect his ability to obtain a \nsecurity clearance so sometime in December 2008, he contacted a debt consolidation \ncompany. He explained to the company that he needed to show the government that he \nwas actively pursuing resolution of his delinquent debts. He told them to include all of \nhis delinquent debts in a payment plan. In his answer to interrogatories, he provided a \nlist of creditors that were to be included in his payment plan. The list includes the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.j, 1.n, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.x, and 1.y. It also includes two additional \ncreditors not listed on the SOR. It did not include SOR \u00b6\u00b61.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, and \n1.m listed on the SOR. The plan required him to start making monthly payments of $306 \nper month beginning on January 19, 2009. He learned in January 2009, that one of his \nsons was in legal trouble. He paid $750 for bail and $1,500, as a retainer fee for a \nlawyer. His son\u2019s grandmother helped pay the additional balance for the legal services. \nDue to this issue, Applicant did not start making his monthly payments as agreed. He \ncontacted the company and arranged to begin the payments in March 2009. During that \nmonth, Applicant seriously injured his eye and needed surgery. He was on short term \ndisability and did not go back to work until June 2009. He did not begin the payment \nplan in March 2009. He again renegotiated the payment plan and anticipated beginning \npayments on September 17, 2009, with monthly payments of $336. Applicant provided \na statement and an attachment which included a new debt management plan. He stated \nthere are discrepancies in the amounts because the balances either have been \n \n4 Tr. 22-33, 44-54; GE 2, 6; AE E. \n \n5 Tr. 23, 84-88; AE F. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nrenegotiated as settlement amounts or have been increased to allow for hidden fees or \ndiscrepancies.6 \n \n \nApplicant does not know what the debt is in SOR \u00b6 1.i. ($346).  He thinks it could \nbe an electric bill, but he has not contacted the creditor nor made any payments.7  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o ($1,970) is a credit card debt that Applicant thought was \nincluded in his debt consolidation plan. He did not provide any documented proof. He \nexplained that his intention was to include all of his debts in his plan, but he does not \nknow which debts are in the plan. His updated plan does not include this debt.8 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.p ($973) is a credit card debt. He stated he does not know if it \nis included in his payment plan. He has not made any payments on it. He indicated he \nused credit cards when he was unemployed. It is not listed in his updated plan.9 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.t ($1,602) is a collection account. No payments were made on \nthis account. It does not appear that this debt is included in updated payment plan.10 \n \n \nThe debt is SOR 1.w ($330) is a phone bill that is not paid.11 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.z ($20,000) is for a defaulted car loan. Applicant stated he \nbought a 2002 Ford Explorer in 2004 for $32,000. He defaulted on the loan in \nDecember 2005. He stated he was paying the collection agency $500 a month \nbeginning sometime at the end of 2006 or early 2007. He has not made a payment \nsince March 2009. He stated his wife had been making the payments when she had a \njob in 2008. She did not work in 2007, so he made the payment when he could. \nApplicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management Investigator in May \n2008. During his interview, he stated he had not made a payment on this loan since \n2005. His statements are inconsistent. He noted that his wife received calls from the \ncollection agency, but he could not recall the name. Applicant stated in his updated \nstatement that he is negotiating with the collection company on this debt and his wife \nwas unable to find the receipts for their payments. The debt remains unpaid.12  \n \n \n6 Tr. 22-26, 40-43, 68-92; AE E, F.  \n \n7 Tr. 92-95. \n \n8 Tr. 95-98; AE F. \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 Tr. 98-99; AE F. \n \n11 Tr. 99. \n \n12 Tr. 100-111; GE 2; AE E. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant verified that he has not made any payments to the debt consolidation \ncompany. He has not made any payments toward his student loans. He has not made \npayments to any of the other creditors. Applicant\u2019s wife is presently unemployed. They \nhave three vehicles. The 2002 Ford Explorer that they defaulted on is still in their \npossession. They also have another 2002 Ford Explorer that was given to them as a \ngift, but Applicant explained it barely works. The third vehicle is a 2007 F150 truck that \nApplicant bought in December 2008, for $17,000. He stated he makes $500 a month \npayments. He does not have insurance on the vehicle, so when he drives it, he does it \nillegally.13 Applicant contributes $280 a month to his 401k. He has not filed his 2008 \nfederal income taxes. He stated the reason for his failure to file was because it has \nbeen a hectic year.14 Applicant does not have a budget and has not had any financial \ncounseling. Applicant explained that because he works it has been difficult to find time \nto contact his creditors. He has left some of that responsibility to his wife. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he noted that he works a compressed work schedule so he is off \nwork every other Friday.15  \n \n \nApplicant provided character statements that stated he is an honest, \nhardworking, God-fearing man. He gives freely of his time and is a good friend. His \ndoctor provided a statement that he is a personable man with a serious and disciplined \nwork ethic.16 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n13 I have not considered this conduct for disqualifying purposes, but will consider it when \nanalyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 Tr. 112-134. \n \n16 AE G, H. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant has a significant history of not meeting his financial obligations. He has \nmore than $76,700 in delinquent debts that are unpaid. I find there is sufficient evidence \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control\u201d); and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid. He did not take action to resolve these debts until his security clearance \nbecame an issue. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. Applicant has had \nfinancial problems since he left the Marine Corps more than 16 years ago. He has been \nunemployed for periods of time. He also has had family responsibilities that affected his \nfinances. His son had legal problems and he had an eye injury and was only receiving \ndisability. These were conditions that were beyond his control and raise the application \nof mitigating condition (b). In order for that mitigating condition to be fully applicable, \nApplicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. In this case, he made \na choice to quit his job and move before he had another job, thereby leaving him \nunemployed for a period of time. He did not set up a payment plan until he realized his \nsecurity clearance was an issue. He purchased a vehicle after another was \nrepossessed and before resolving this debt. He has not contacted some of his creditors. \nI find mitigating condition (b) only partially applies. Applicant has not received any \nfinancial counseling. Although he contacted a debt consolidation company and set up a \nplan, he has not made any payments on the plan. Not all of his debts are included in the \nplan. He does not have a budget and there are no significant indicators to show the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nproblem is being resolved and is under control. He has not addressed his delinquent \nstudent loans. At this juncture, I cannot find that he has made a good-faith effort to \nresolve his delinquent debts. I find mitigating conditions (c) and (d) do not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country as a \nMarine. Since being discharged from the Marines in 1993, he has experienced financial \nproblems. He was unemployed for a period of time. He had family medical issues. His \nson had legal problems. These events were beyond his control. However, after 16 years \nApplicant has not developed a budget or a sound financial plan to address his financial \nobligations. He recently set up a payment plan, but until he demonstrates that he has \nmade consistent monthly payments on that plan, it is too early to conclude that his \nfinances are under control. He has not addressed all of his debt, including large debts \nowed for student loans and a repossessed vehicle. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.z: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

On October 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 12, 2008, in which\nshe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on January 26, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information\nin rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on February 4, 2009, and she submitted a reply dated March 1, 2009.  The case\nwas assigned to the undersigned for resolution on March 16, 2009.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe FORM and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 36 years old and divorced.  She is\nemployed by a defense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  Her two delinquent debts totaled approximately $39,600.00.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 6 and 7). She is indebted to Sears/Citi for an account that was\ncharged off in the amount of approximately $14,848.00.  This debt remains outstanding.\nShe was also indebted to Unifund/Citibank Universal/Pinnacle for an account placed\ninto collection in the amount of approximately $24,751.00.  This debt has now been\nresolved.  Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM indicates that she recently negotiated with\nUnifund/Citibank Universal/Pinnacle and settled the debt for $9,600.00.  (See copy of\ncheck submitted for payment in Applicant\u2019s Reply to the FORM).  Applicant states that\nshe is currently setting up a plan to pay her only remaining delinquent debt owed to\nSears/Citi in the amount of $14,848.00.  \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, (Government Exhibit 4), she attributes her\nexcessive financial indebtedness to a car accident in late 2004 that totaled her car and\ncaused her to have to purchase and take on a new car loan.  In 2005, she incurred\nmoving expenses and higher rent.  At the same time, she had student loan obligations,\nand interest rates on her credit cards increased.  Her minimum payments on her credit\ncards doubled from 2% to 4% in 2006, which caused her to lose control of her finances.\nAt that point, she decided that she could only afford to pay for the essentials which\nincluded her utilities rent and food, car loan and student loan payments.  Her credit card\nbills had to wait, and so she stopped making payments on four credit card accounts.  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n3\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n      20(d)  the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\n\n4\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nAdmittedly, the Applicant\u2019s car accident, her move, her student loans and\nincreased credit card interest rates contributed to her financial problems.  In addition,\nwhen she incurred the debt, she was much younger, immature and not as responsible\nas she is now.  Recently, she has settled one of her two delinquent debts.  Under the\nparticular circumstances of this case, I find that the Applicant has done her best, given\nthe excessive nature of the two debts, and has made a good faith effort to resolve them.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case. \n\n5\nWith respect to her finances, the Applicant indicates that she is setting up a\npayment plan to pay the remaining debt.  Although she has just started the process of\naddressing her last delinquent debt, and has a long way to go before it is resolved, she\nhas shown good judgment under the circumstances.  Her plan is to immediately start\nmaking payments to resolve her remaining debt or to pay it off in full.  If she does not,\nher security clearance will be in immediate jeopardy.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may properly safeguard classified information.  \nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\nMitigating Condition 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also applies.  The Applicant had initiated a good\nfaith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts.  Accordingly, I\nfind for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have falsified her May 2008 e-QIP by failing to accurately disclose her delinquent debts in response to questions 28.a concerning any debts delinquent over 180 days in the last seven years, and 28.b concerning any debts currently delinquent over 90 days (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and by failing to disclose a vehicle repossession in the past seven years in response to question 27.b (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The alleged illegal acceptance of state welfare benefits was also cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.c). In her Answer, Applicant admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.t and indicated she had been in a mentally abusive relationship with her son\u2019s father and assumed bills were being paid until it was too late. She acknowledged that the cable television debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a appeared on her credit record but claimed it had been paid by a former roommate. Applicant denied she had knowingly and illegally collected $8,000 in welfare benefits from 2006 to early 2008. She maintained she was a legal resident when she first received the state entitlements.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nFrom about March 2006 to February 2007, Applicant continued to accept public\nassistance knowing she was ineligible. She owes about $50,000 in delinquent debt that\nshe has little prospect of resolving in the foreseeable future. Her failure to fully disclose\nher indebtedness on her security clearance application was due to misunderstanding\nand neglect of her financial obligations rather than to an intent to conceal. Financial and\npersonal conduct concerns persist because of her financial irresponsibility and poor\njudgment in accepting welfare benefits when she was ineligible. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 14, 2008. On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\ndecision to deny her a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative\njudge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nJune 30, 2009\n\n2\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\neffective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 9, 2009. On February\n24, 2009, she responded and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on\nApril 2, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On April 16,\n2009, I scheduled a hearing for May 7, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Four government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and\nfour Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-D) were admitted, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a\ntranscript (Tr.) received on May 14, 2009. The record was held open until May 28, 2009,\nfor Applicant to submit documentation concerning a settlement offer, but nothing was\nreceived. Based on a review of the SOR, Answer, transcript, and documentary exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $54,035 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.t), and that she knowingly and\nillegally collected about $8,000 in public assistance (welfare) from about 2006 to early\n2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.u). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have\nfalsified her May 2008 e-QIP by failing to accurately disclose her delinquent debts in\nresponse to questions 28.a concerning any debts delinquent over 180 days in the last\nseven years, and 28.b concerning any debts currently delinquent over 90 days (SOR \u00b6\n2.a), and by failing to disclose a vehicle repossession in the past seven years in\nresponse to question 27.b (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The alleged illegal acceptance of state welfare\nbenefits was also cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.c).\nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.t and\nindicated she had been in a mentally abusive relationship with her son\u2019s father and\nassumed bills were being paid until it was too late. She acknowledged that the cable\ntelevision debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a appeared on her credit record but claimed it had been paid\nby a former roommate. Applicant denied she had knowingly and illegally collected\n$8,000 in welfare benefits from 2006 to early 2008. She maintained she was a legal\nresident when she first received the state entitlements. She moved to a nearby state\nlater in 2006, acquired a job, and the welfare payments ceased in February 2007.\nApplicant acknowledged she had not included all her delinquent debts or the vehicle\nrepossession on her e-QIP. However, she denied any intentional falsification, and\nexplained that she was \u201cnot aware of the amount or delinquency of all items on [her]\ncredit report,\u201d and assumed the repossession question referred to land or housing\nproperty. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 38-year-old single mother with a five-year-old son. She has been\nemployed by a defense contractor in state A since late May 2008 and seeks her first\nsecurity clearance (Ex. 1, Tr. 40). She had been working in the conformal coating\n\nThe e-QIP admitted as Exhibit 1 is missing page 28, concerning her employment between June 2000\n1\nand March 2002.\n3\ndepartment (Ex. A). As of May 2009, she was on loan to another department pending\nher hearing on her clearance eligibility (Tr. 39).\n Before her present employment, Applicant held a series of low paying jobs (Ex.\n2). She worked as a customer service representative for a paving company and as a\ngreeter for a car dealer. Then in June 2000, she started bartending.  In February 2002,\n1\nshe moved to an adjacent state (state B) where she continued to work as a bartender\nuntil November 2003. With the exception of a seasonal job with a retailer in late 2003,\nshe was unemployed during her pregnancy and birth of her son (Tr. 46). She was living\nwith her son\u2019s father in an apartment in state B (Tr. 46). In August 2004, she began\nworking as a waitress in state B. One year later, she moved with her son to a distant\nstate, but they stayed only until October 2005. On her return to state A, Applicant\nworked as a cashier at a snack bar, but she left that position in November 2005\nbecause she lost her child care (Ex. 1). \nWhile unemployed and living in state A in January 2006, Applicant applied for\nand began receiving public assistance (transitional aid to families with dependent\nchildren and food stamps) from state A. Applicant was then living with her sister and\napplied using that address. She was eligible for public assistance if she resided in state\nA and met the income requirements (Tr. 53). She was given transitional aid of $328.36\nin January 2006, and $342 monthly from February 2006 through July 2006. In August\n2006, she was given $257.32, $312 in September 2006, and $162 in October 2006.\nApplicant received food stamp aid of $268 in January 2006, $258 monthly from\nFebruary 2006 through August 2006, $203 in September 2006, and $210 in October\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.u) (Ex. D).\nIn March 2006, Applicant and her son\u2019s father moved into an apartment in state B\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 49). She did not notify state A that she had moved out of state and she\nknowingly continued to accept welfare benefits to which she was not entitled through\nOctober 2006 because she needed the financial help (Exs. C, D, Tr. 29, 50, 52).\nApplicant began working as a first-shift bartender in state A, but within the month, the\nmanager gave her the option of taking a waitress position or quitting. Applicant elected\nto leave the job (Tr. 74-75),  and she was unemployed until July 2006, when she started\nworking as a waitress for a bistro in state A (Ex. 1). State A discontinued her transitional\nassistance effective November 2006, although the state inexplicably gave her $10\nmonthly in food stamp aid from December 2006 through February 2007 (Ex. 2, Ex. D,\nTr. 50).\nIn June 2007, she took a waitress position at a country club in state A because it\nwas closer to her residence in state B. In November 2007, she and the father of her son\nmoved in with his mother in state B. In April 2008, Applicant was let go from her job due\n\nThe controller at the country club indicates discrepantly that Applicant was a conscientious and loyal\n2\nemployee who left the job in an effort to obtain more hours and better pay and benefits (see Ex. B). \nApplicant\u2019s November 2008 credit report (Ex. 3) indicates that the account had a balance owed of\n3\n$1,896 as of December 2002, but it was paid after collection as of December 2006. Applicant testified that she\nlisted it on her e-QIP because she had found documentation about the debt in an old organizer from years\nago. It was one of her older debts (Tr. 87-88).\n4\nto customer complaints, although she had already applied for work with her present\nemployer (Tr. 76-77).2\nWith her offer of employment from the defense contractor, Applicant was sent an\ne-QIP, which she completed at home on her computer on May 14, 2008. She reported\nthat she had been terminated from her last job due to customer complaints, but\nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to question 27.b concerning whether her wages had been garnished or\nwhether she had any property repossessed in the last seven years. In response to the\nfinancial delinquency inquiries, she answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7\nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?,\u201d and listed a credit\ncard debt of $1,896 (not alleged in SOR ) from October 2003. She responded \u201cNo\u201d to\n3\nquestion 28.b, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d (Ex. 1).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on May 24, 2008, revealed Applicant had a vehicle\nthat had been involuntarily repossessed in March 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.t), and several other\naccounts had been placed for collection. A history of her delinquent accounts is\nreflected in the following table.\nDebt as alleged in SOR\nDelinquency history\nStatus as of May 09\n\u00b6 1.a.

Illegal welfare\nbenefits $8,000\n$5,628.68 in total benefits\nJan 06-Feb 07 (Ex. D),\nabout $1,196.36 while she\nwas living in state A\nClaims the state sent her a\nletter a few weeks ago\nrequesting restitution of\nlittle over $800, unpaid (Tr.\n53)\nOn June 27, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nher finances. She attributed her debt to low wages and occasionally living outside of her\nmeans. She indicated she was residing with her boyfriend\u2019s parents, to whom she pays\nrent, and that she had nothing left over each month after paying her expenses. Asked\nabout her larger debts, Applicant explained that the vehicle debt (SOR \u00b6 1.t) was for a\nvehicle purchased in May 2005. She stopped making her monthly payment of $503 after\nnine payments and the vehicle was involuntarily repossessed. She indicated that she\nhad two credit cards with the same lender, SOR \u00b6 1.l used to purchase a stereo for her\nboyfriend and SOR \u00b6 1.n for miscellaneous items.  Applicant explained that the debts in\n6\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j were for items purchased through  mail order catalogs. She admitted\nthat she had not contacted any of her creditors in years and that she cannot pay them.\nAs for the welfare benefits, Applicant averred she had illegally collected \u201cabout $8,000\n[sic]\u201d in public assistance from state A while she was living in state B, but the payments\nstopped when the state learned she was not a resident. Applicant was told she would not\nlikely face prosecution given the amount involved. The investigator reported that\nApplicant told her that she took advantage of the credit extended to her knowing that she\ndid not have the means to repay the debt, and that she did not intend to repay the\nwelfare funds (Ex. 2).\nDOHA provided Applicant with a copy of the investigator\u2019s report of the June 27,\n2008, interview. Applicant responded on November 12, 2008, that the report was\nincorrect in some aspects. She denied she had obtained credit with an intent to not repay\nit. She had made payments until she could no longer afford to and it was not her sole\npurpose to exploit credit cards. As for the welfare benefits, Applicant explained that she\ncollected welfare legally while residing in state A for months before she moved to state\nB. Applicant added that she intended to make restitution with her creditors, including\nstate A, provided she kept her job with the defense contractor, which she saw as the key\nto her and her son\u2019s futures (Ex. 2).\nApplicant has been living off and on with her son\u2019s father for the past nine years.\nThey have lived together since August 2007 for convenience reasons and no longer as a\ncouple. Applicant cannot afford to live on her own (Tr. 37). Until about March 2009, they\nresided most recently with his parents, to whom they paid rent. They were forced to\nmove to an apartment when her son\u2019s grandparents decided to vacate the home after\nanother of their tenants entered a nursing home (Tr. 54-55). About $3,000 of her $4,800\nincome tax refund for tax year 2008 went to pay for moving expenses and necessities\n(oil, groceries) (Tr. 54).\n\n8\nAs of May 2009, Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s father was paying the $1,000 monthly rent and\nutilities (Tr. 36-37). He works as a chef (Tr. 72). She was covering the groceries and\n$207 per week in daycare costs for their son (Tr. 37-38). She does not have a car\npayment and does not have car insurance (Tr. 38).\nApplicant has received no credit counseling and has not looked into debt\nconsolidation because she could not afford the likely monthly payment (Tr. 78). She also\ndid not consider bankruptcy because she understood she would have to commit to a\ncertain repayment each month. She is currently living just within her means (Tr. 79). As\nof early May 2009, her hourly wage was $12.71, with her wage set to increase by $1.00\nevery six months (Tr. 80). With her raise coming at the end of May 2009,  Applicant\nestimated she would have an additional $30 per week in income. She planned on\naddressing the smaller debts, such as the delinquent cable bills in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c,\nfirst (Tr. 72, 80).\nApplicant proved to be a very dependable employee while working in the\nconformal coating department for the defense contractor. She was considered an asset\nto the department working on critical deliverables, and performed well and in a timely\nmanner even under the pressure of deadlines (Ex. A).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present\nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\n\n9\nCounsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of\nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified\nor sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant admitted owing all but $398 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) of the $53,035 in delinquent\ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.t. However, based on the account numbers, the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.s is merely an updated balance of the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f.\nApplicant claims the $398 cable television debt (SOR \u00b61.a) has been paid, and she has\nno knowledge of the $2,460 medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. While the medical debt does not\nappear on her most recent credit report, the cable television debt is listed as unpaid on\nher November 2008 credit report. Applicant did not furnish documentation of payment or\notherwise satisfy AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d with regard to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.o. Concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l\nand 1.n, Applicant told a government investigator that she had two delinquent accounts\nwith the same original creditor. Even discounting SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.o, her delinquent\ndebt still totals more than $49,000. She also has to repay state A at least $800 for public\nassistance granted to her when she was ineligible. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and \u00b6 19(e),\n\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\n\n10\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and other\nfinancial analysis,\u201d are implicated.\nAG \u00b6 19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement,\nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive\nloan statements, and other financial breaches of trust,\u201d also must be considered in this\ncase. Applicant applied for, and was granted, public assistance benefits in state A in\nJanuary 2006. Unemployed at the time and living with her sister in state A, Applicant\nqualified for those benefits. However, in March 2006, she moved to state B and no\nlonger met the residency requirement. She withheld her relocation from the office of\ntransitional assistance, knowing it was wrong to do so, and she continued to collect\nwelfare benefits of about $4,402.32 through October 2006 before her assistance was\nterminated. Her fraudulent acceptance of welfare is not extenuated by the fact that she\nneeded the aid (Tr. 29).\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\ncannot reasonably be applied.  Her financial problems are extensive and ongoing\ndespite her steady employment with the defense contractor over the past year and the\nfinancial assistance provided by her son\u2019s father.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d cannot be dismissed outright given her history of\nlow-wage employment, but her financial difficulties are also attributable to her own poor\nfinancial choices. She denies that she exploited her creditors by taking on debt that she\nhad no intent to repay, but she admits that she made purchases at times, including a\nstereo for her boyfriend (SOR \u00b6 1.l), that she could not readily afford. Her fraudulent\nacceptance of welfare benefits is further indication of irresponsible behavior. Although\nshe had to leave some jobs in the past due to transportation/daycare issues, she quit at\nleast one job because she did not want to wait tables. AG \u00b6 20(b) has very limited\napplicability in this case.\nAs of May 2009, Applicant had made no payments toward her delinquent debts,\nincluding to state A in restitution of the welfare benefits. She had not contacted any of\nher creditors to make payment arrangements. Nor had she responded to a recent\nsettlement offer because she lacks the funds to make the payments, despite the financial\nassistance of her son\u2019s father, who pays the rent and utilities. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d nor AG \u00b620(d), \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts,\u201d apply in the absence of any meaningful effort to address her past due financial\nobligations.  AG \u00b6 20(e), supra, has only very limited applicability in this case, to SOR \u00b6\n1.f. The updated balance of that debt is in SOR \u00b6 1.s. The extra $30 per week in income\nis insufficient for Applicant to resolve her extensive debt in the near future.\n\n11\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, untrustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe government alleged that Applicant was not fully forthcoming about her\ndelinquencies on her e-QIP completed on May 14, 2008 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). Applicant\nadmits she failed to list all of her delinquent accounts on her security clearance\napplication. However, since she disputes the knowing and intentional concealment, the\nburden is on the government to prove the intent required under AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nApplicant explained that she responded negatively on the e-QIP to whether she\nhad any property repossessed within the last seven years because she thought the\nquestion pertained to \u201cland, housing, a mortgage\u201d (Tr. 63). A layperson may conceivably\nconsider \u201cproperty\u201d to pertain to real estate and not appreciate that the scope of the\ninquiry covers personal property such as a car. As for her negative response to question\n28.b (any debts currently over 90 days delinquent), Applicant credibly explained that she\nthought it pertained to her current accounts and those were not past due over 90 days. \nApplicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to whether she had any debts over 180 days\ndelinquent in the last seven years, but she disclosed only one credit card debt. While\nApplicant knew she had several past-due obligations, she explained she did not have the\naccount information available. She had discarded bills in her various moves knowing she\nwould receive more (Tr. 60-61). As for the information about the debt disclosed,\nApplicant had checked \u201cNot Applicable\u201d with regard to date satisfied. Her November\n2008 credit report shows the debt as a paid collection debt as of December 2006 (Ex. 3).\nHer failure to accurately report that debt as paid supports her testimony that she found\nthe account information in an old organizer (Tr. 88) and she was unaware what she\nowed and to whom. Applicant\u2019s deliberate disregard of her financial obligations (throwing\naway bills, making no payments) has negative implications for her financial judgment\n(see Guideline F), but the evidence falls short of proving the intent required under AG \u00b6\n16(a).\nApplicant\u2019s fraudulent acceptance of welfare benefits implicates the general\npersonal conduct concerns under AG \u00b6 15, and is untrustworthy behavior of the type\ncontemplated within AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly\n\n12\ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d \nConcerning potential factors in mitigation, Applicant understands that what she did\nwas wrong, and there has been no recurrence of any similar untrustworthy behavior in\nover two years. AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d cannot be applied, however, given she\nhas made no effort to make restitution. She testified that following an investigation, she is\nnot likely to be prosecuted, but that she also received a letter a few weeks ago indicating\nthat she has to repay a little over $800 (Tr. 53). None of the other mitigating conditions\nare pertinent.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). Applicant\nremains under a substantial debt burden that she has taken no steps to resolve. It is\nunrealistic to expect her to put her creditors ahead of providing basic necessities for\nherself and her son, but the concerns in this case go beyond the day-to-day struggles of\nliving on a relatively low income. Applicant has raised considerable concerns about her\n\n13\njudgment and reliability because of her history of consumer credit abuse and her\ncontinued acceptance of welfare benefits when she knew she was ineligible. She has\nbeen an asset to her defense contractor employer. Yet doubts persist about whether she\ncan be counted on to put her fiduciary obligations ahead of her personal interests in light\nof her handling of her financial matters, including the welfare issue.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nDuplicate of \u00b6 1.f\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n14\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 12, 2008. On \nDecember 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns based on financial considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 3, 2009, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. On March 20, 2009, she requested a hearing. Department \nJuly 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel was ready to proceed on April 24, 2009. The case was assigned to me on April \n27, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 28, 2009, scheduling the hearing for \nMay 20, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 13 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented \nthe testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through O, \nwhich were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until June 5, 2009, to \nenable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX \nP through Y, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments \nconcerning AX P through Y are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. The record \nclosed on June 5, 2009, and DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on the same day. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel pointed out that the last five allegations in \nthe SOR were mislabeled as \u00b6\u00b6 1.h through 1.i. On my own motion, without objection \nfrom either party, the last five allegations were labeled as \u00b6\u00b6 1.j through 1.n (Tr. 22). \nThe amendments are handwritten on the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \nthrough 1.h, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old engineer technician (Tr. 51) employed by a defense \ncontractor. She has worked for her current employer since May 1998.  \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1988 to December \n1997 (AX C). She was discharged as a staff sergeant (E-6) and had been selected for \npromotion (Tr. 60). She testified she received a security clearance and eligibility for \naccess to Sensitive Compartmented Information in May 1988, while she was on active \nduty (Tr. 63). \n \n \nApplicant was married in May 1996 and divorced in September 1997. She \nremarried in March 2001 and was divorced in October 2005. She married for a third \ntime in July 2007 and was separated in October 2007. She has a 12-year-old son from \nher first marriage. Her son has attention deficit disorder and asthma, requiring regular \nmedical attention and expensive prescriptions (Tr. 88). \n \n \nApplicant attended a community college part-time from January 2001 to \nDecember 2007. She also attended a university from March to December 2004 and \ntook online college courses from January to May 2005. She has not yet received a \ndegree from any of the institutions where she attended classes.  \n \n \nApplicant and her then-spouse filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July \n2003. Applicant testified the bankruptcy was necessary because of her spouse\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n \n \nuncontrolled spending (Tr. 54). The bankruptcy was discharged in September 2006 \nafter they completed their Chapter 13 payment plan (GX 12). They divorced because of \nher spouse\u2019s spending habits (Tr. 56). The bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m.  \n \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories and submitted \na personal financial statement (PFS). She reported net monthly income of $2,021.56, \nexpenses of $2,072.94, and a negative net monthly remainder of $51.38 (GX 5 at 15). \nThis negative cash flow is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. \n \n \nApplicant has sought and received financial counseling (AX O). After she \nsubmitted her PFS, she was able to negotiate a change in her home mortgage terms \nthat reduced her monthly payments from $1,005.44 to $468.65 (Tr. 43-44). She also \nreceived a promotion and a pay raise in March 2009, increasing her gross pay by about \n$140 per pay period (Tr. 52). She now earns a net pay of $1,142 every two-week pay \nperiod, plus any overtime she works (Tr. 43-44). She usually works about ten hours of \novertime, sometimes 20 hours, which increases her pay by $300 to $600 (Tr. 52).  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l). The table below \nsummarizes the evidence regarding these debts. \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nHomeowners\u2019 Association \n$76 \nPaid \nAnswer to SOR \n1.b \nHomeowners\u2019 Association \n$466 \nPaid \nAnswer to SOR \n1.c \nDepartment Store \n$654 \nIncluded in Chap 13 \nAX F \n1.d \nHomeowners\u2019 Association \n$272 \nPaid \nAnswer to SOR \n1.e \nStudent loan \n$1,000 \nPaying $50 per month \nAX K, L \n1.f \nStudent loan \n$4,609 \nPaying $50 per month \nAnswer to SOR \nAX B, H, I, J \n1.g \nMedical \n$75 \nPaid \nAX G, U \n1.h \nCollege tuition \n$517 \nPaying $50 per month \nTr. 80 \n1.i \nTelephone \n$350 \nPaid \nAnswer to SOR \nAX E \n1.j \nCollege tuition \n$525 \nSame as 1.h \nAX P \n1.k \nElectric bill \n$368 \nPaid \nAnswer to \nSOR, AX W \n1.l \nCable bill \n$136 \nPaid \nAX V \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother has assisted her in paying off her delinquent debts. She has \npromised to repay her mother when she is able. She also has agreed to do chores and \nrun errands for her mother in return for the loan (Tr. 90).  \n \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted another PFS reflecting net monthly income \nof $3,144, expenses of $2,352, and a remainder of $731 (AX S). This PFS indicates a \nmortgage payment of $1,003, not the reduced payment of $468 provided for in her loan \nmodification agreement.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant has disputed the college tuition debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. She believes \nit is the same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.h. She provided records from the National Student Loan \nData System indicating she had tuition bills from the institution alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h but \nnot the institution identified by the collection agency as the original creditor (AX Q and \nR). She testified she had an oral agreement to pay $50 per month by automatic \ndeduction from her checking account (Tr. 81), but she provided no documentation of the \npayments on this debt. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor submitted a statement on her behalf. Her \nsupervisor has known Applicant for the last eight years and describes her as reliable, \ntrustworthy, and competent. Applicant has a reputation for being dependable and \u201ccan \nbe counted on to go the extra mile\u201d to carry out her duties (AX D). \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt testified on her behalf. The witness has known Applicant since \nshe was born. She regards Applicant as a good mother and a hard worker. She does \nnot like to ask family members for help. In both of her two previous marriages, Applicant \nwas the primary breadwinner. Applicant lives modestly. She once owned an expensive \ncar, but she sold it when she realized it was \u201cway beyond her means,\u201d and she now \ndrives a car that she has owned for 13 or 14 years (Tr. 36-41). It is a 17-year-old \neconomy car (Tr. 87).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged \ncondition that is raised by \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending \nand the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \n\n \n6 \n \n \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). AG \u00b6 19(b) is \napplicable to her purchase of an expensive imported car, but the evidence reflects that \nshe quickly realized that she could not afford it, and she sold it. There is no evidence \nthat the purchase of this vehicle contributed to her financial difficulties. Accordingly, I \nconclude AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition does not apply because Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, not yet fully solved, \nand did not occur under circumstances unlikely to recur. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). The debts incurred during Applicant\u2019s first two \nmarriages were resolved by her Chapter 13 bankruptcy. She was the breadwinner \nduring these two marriages and she presented no evidence that the loss of the spouse\u2019s \nincome contributed to her problems. She presented no evidence that her current \nmarriage and separation contributed to her financial difficulties. Her son\u2019s medical \ncondition is a circumstance beyond her control, but she presented no evidence that his \nmedical expenses have contributed to her financial problems. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is established, because Applicant obtained financial counseling and \nshe has her financial situation under control. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant has presented evidence that the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.c was included in her bankruptcy, and that she has paid or is making \npayments on all other debts. She did not document her payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h; however, in the context of her vigorous efforts to resolve all her debts, I am \nconfident this debt is not being ignored.  \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult with a long record of military and civilian service. She \nhas held a clearance since 1988, apparently without incident. She has worked for her \ncurrent employer for 11 years and is highly regarded by her supervisor. Most of her \ndebts are for educational expenses. She lives frugally and drives a 17-year-old car. It \nhas taken her a while to gain the financial discipline she needs, but she appears to have \nbenefited from financial counseling, and she has taken aggressive steps, with the help \nof her mother, to achieve financial stability.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his undated Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.e~1.n, 1.p. and 1.r. of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in Paragraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.o. and 1.q. of the SOR. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Applicant incurred \u201cjust about\u201d all of his past due indebtedness from marriages with his \u201c1 & 2 ex wife(sic)\u201d (Item 4 at page 4). As a result, there are 18 st nd alleged past due debts. 1.a. The first debt is for a car loan in the amount of about $10,289 (Item 7 at page 1). The Applicant denies this past due debt, averring that his \u201cex wife got [it] in [their] divorce\u201d (Item 4 at page 1). As the creditor was not a party to Applicant\u2019s divorce, it is not bound by the terms of that divorce. I find that this debt is still owing. 1.b.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 21, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 5, 2008.  On November 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 21, 2008.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing soon thereafter, and requested an Administrative\nDetermination by an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel issued a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) on January 26, 2009.  The Applicant did not to respond to\nthe FORM.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn his undated Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nParagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.e~1.n, 1.p. and 1.r. of the SOR, with explanations.  He denied\nthe factual allegations in Paragraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.o. and 1.q. of the SOR.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant incurred \u201cjust about\u201d all of his past due indebtedness from\nmarriages with his \u201c1  & 2  ex wife(sic)\u201d (Item 4 at page 4).  As a result, there are 18\nst\nnd\nalleged past due debts.\n1.a.  The first debt is for a car loan in the amount of about $10,289 (Item 7 at\npage 1).  The Applicant denies this past due debt, averring that his \u201cex wife got [it] in\n[their] divorce\u201d (Item 4 at page 1).  As the creditor was not a party to Applicant\u2019s divorce,\nit is not bound by the terms of that divorce.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.b.  The second debt is a medical bill in the amount of about $192 (Item 7 at\npage 1).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.c.  The third debt is a wireless phone bill in the amount of about $439 (Item 7 at\npage 1).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.d.  The fourth debt is another medical bill in the amount of about $64 (Item 7 at\npage 2).  The Applicant denies this past due debt, averring that he is \u201cnot sure\u201d about\nthis debt, but offers nothing further (Item 4 at page 2).  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.e.  The fifth debt is creditor E in the amount of about $184 (Item 7 at page 2).\nThe Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.f.  The sixth debt is a third medical bill in the amount of about $1,469 (Item 7 at\npage 2).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.g.  The seventh debt is a credit card bill in the amount of about $2,021 (Item 7\nat page 2).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.h.  The eighth debt is another credit card bill in the amount of about $2,680\n(Item 7 at page 2).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still\nowing.\n1.i.  The ninth debt is to a credit union in the amount of about $187 (Item 7 at\npage 2).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.j.  The tenth debt is a cable TV bill in the amount of about $192 (Item 7 at page\n2).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.k.  The eleventh debt is another wireless phone bill in the amount of about\n$603 (Item 7 at page 2).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is\nstill owing.\n\n3\n1.l.  The twelfth debt is for another car loan in the amount of about $9,512 (Item 7\nat page 2).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.m.  The thirteenth debt is to creditor M in the amount of about $683 (Item 8 at\npage 4).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.n.  The fourteenth debt is gas credit card bill in the amount of about $666 (Item\n8 at page 6).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.o.  The fifteenth debt is for a fourth medical bill in the amount of about $34,493\n(Item 8 at page 9).  The Applicant denies this past due debt, again averring that his \u201cex\nwife got [it] in [their] divorce\u201d (Item 4 at page 2).  As the creditor was not a party to\nApplicant\u2019s divorce, it is not bound by the terms of that divorce.  I find that this debt is\nstill owing.\n1.p.  The sixteenth debt is to a bank in the amount of about $7,516 (Item 8 at\npage 9).  The Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.q.  The seventeenth debt is to creditor Q in the amount of about $8,947 (Item 8\nat page 10).  The Applicant denies this past due debt, averring that his \u201cex wife got [it] in\n[their] divorce\u201d (Item 4 at page 3).  As the creditor was not a party to Applicant\u2019s divorce,\nit is not bound by the terms of that divorce.  I find that this debt is still owing.\n1.r.  The final debt is a utility bill in the amount of about $406 (Item 8 at page 11).\nThe Applicant admits this past due debt.  I find that this debt is still owing.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG Subparagraph19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations@ may raise security concerns.  Subparagraph 20(b), it may be\nmitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.@  As noted above, the Applicant attributes his\nfinancial difficulties to two prior divorces, but he has done nothing to address his\nsubstantial past due indebtedness.  As such, I can find no countervailing mitigating\nconditions that are applicable.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Subparagraph 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHere, the Applicant has offered nothing to demonstrate that he is addressing any\nof his past due debts.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and\ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\nFinancial Considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRICHARD A. CEFOLA\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Tr. 57.)  \n \n \nThe June 2009 SOR alleged that since his 2004 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant \naccumulated $26,077 of delinquent debts owed to 17 creditors. (GE 3, 4)  Applicant \nstated that he disputed many of the debts again in September 2009, having not \nreceived replies to his previous December 2008 dispute letters. The status of each of \nthe 17 debts is as follows: \n \n  \nI. Debts Disputed and Removed from Subsequent Credit Bureau Reports \n \n(1) Applicant twice disputed the debt alleged in \u00b6 1. a for $592. It is owed to a \ncellular phone company. He denies owing the debt. It is listed on the February \n2008 CBR, but not on the January 2009 or September 2009 CBRs. (GE 3, 4; \nAE A; Tr. 31.)  \n \n(2) In December 2008, Applicant disputed the medical debt alleged in \u00b6 1.d for \n$617. He stated that he paid the debt. It is listed on the February 2008 CBR, \nbut not on the January 2009 or September 2009 CBRs. (GE 3, 4; AE A; Tr. \n35.) \n \n(3) In December 2008, Applicant disputed the medical debt alleged \u00b6 1.n for \n$416. It appears on the January 2009 CBR, but not on the September 2009 \nCBR. (GE 3, 4: AE A.) \n \n(4)  In December 2008, Applicant disputed the medical debt alleged \u00b6 1.o for \n$148. It appears on the January 2009 CBR, but not on the September 2009 \nCBR. (GE 3, 4: AE A.) \n \n(5) In December 2008, Applicant disputed the medical debt alleged \u00b6 1.p for $53. \nIt appears on the January 2009 CBR, but not on the September 2009 CBR. \n(GE 3, 4: AE A.) \n \nII. Debts Disputed and Deleted from Credit Bureau Reporting Agency \n \n(6-13) Eight medical debts have been deleted from Applicant\u2019s credit report \npursuant to his dispute: \u00b6 1.b for $73; \u00b6 1.c for $159; \u00b6 1.e for $306; \u00b6 1.f for \n$46; \u00b6 1.g for $33; \u00b6 1.l for $86; \u00b6 1.m for $257; and \u00b6 1.q for $73.

Debt Included in 2004 Bankruptcy \n \n(14) The $101 cellular debt alleged in \u00b6 1.j was included in the 2004 bankruptcy. \n(AE F; GE 2: 12/10/08 CBR.)   \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nIV. Debts Disputed and Verified \n \n(15) After disputing the medical debt alleged in \u00b6 1.h for $4,784, the credit \nreporting agency verified it as Applicant\u2019s debt in October 2009. (AE F, G.) In his \nDecember 2008 letter, he indicated that the debt could be for a surgery he had \ntwo years earlier, but he was not certain because he thought his insurance would \nhave paid it. (GE 2 at 113.) \n \n(16) After disputing the $70 medical debt alleged in \u00b6 1.i, the credit reporting \nagency verified it as Applicant\u2019s debt. (AE F.)  \n \nV. Debt in Dispute \n \n(17) Applicant continues to dispute the debt listed in \u00b6 1.k for $18,263, although \nthe credit reporting agency verified it.2 (AE F.) After working for his previous \nemployer for six years, he lost his job in December 2006. He was offered a \nseverance package that included six months of severance pay, essentially one \nmonth\u2019s pay for each year he worked. (Tr. 29.) He received that pay, but was \ninformed by the company in October 2007 that he should have only been paid for \nten weeks. (GE 2 at 120.) His employer claims he was paid the additional money \nin error. Applicant thought the matter was resolved until he received a CBR from \nDOHA in October 2008 and learned the employer submitted the claim to a \ncollection agency. (Tr. 56.) Applicant has not taken legal action because he \ncannot afford legal fees. (Tr. 71.) This appears to be a legitimate dispute \nbetween Applicant and his former employer. (AE B, D, E; Tr. 39-40.) \n \n \nIn summary, $18,263 of the $26,077 delinquent debt alleged in the SOR relates \nto Applicant\u2019s dispute with his former employer about severance pay that he received. \nApplicant has successfully disputed 13 debts, totaling $2,960, resulting in their deletion \nor removal from his credit file. Twelve of those debts were medical debts. One of the \ndebts ($101) was included in his 2004 bankruptcy discharge. Two medical debts, \ntotaling $4,784, were verified in October 2009 as his debts and need to be resolved or \npaid by him. (AE G.)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted his budget. His net monthly income is $3,905. His expenses \nare $1,650 and his payments on financial obligations are $1,857, leaving him a \nremainder of $398 at the end of the month. He works overtime many weeks, which adds \nto his income. (AE C.) In a letter he included in his December 2008 response to the \nInterrogatories, he explained his financial situation as follows: \n \nI feel that I am in good financial status. I filed bankruptcy 5 years ago due \nto an overwhelming amount of medical debt incurred due to my daughter\u2019s \ndisability and my wife\u2019s medical condition and deteriorating health. I have \n                                            \n2The exact amount of this debt is unclear. In the government\u2019s interrogatories the debt is listed for \n$16,690. In a letter from the collection agency, the amount is listed as $13,775. (AE E.)  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nnot been late or missed a payment on my mortgage, credit card, or car \npayment since. (GE 2 at 121.) \n \nAlthough the February 2008, December 2008, January 2009, and September 2009 \nCBRs disclose some of the alleged delinquent debts, the CBRs also list numerous \naccounts that are being \u201cpaid as agreed. \u201c (GE 2, 3, 4; AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified. He has known Applicant since March 2009. He \nsaid that Applicant \u201chas shown an incredible aptitude for strategic vision as well as \ntactical execution. He\u2019s performing in the top 10 percent of the company with regard to \nhis work range.\u201d (Tr. 67.) He is very supportive of Applicant\u2019s efforts to secure a security \nclearance. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and does not think they would \ncause a potential security risk. (Tr. 69.) \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial problems that began in \n2001 and resulted in the discharge of delinquent debt through a bankruptcy in 2004. He \nsubsequently accumulated additional debts that he did not begin to address until 2008. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties, three of which may be applicable to this case: \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant started \naccumulating a large amount of debt attributable to his wife and daughter\u2019s medical \ncondition in 2001 that he resolved through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2004. \nSince then, he incurred some additional medical bills and became engaged in a \nmonetary dispute with his previous employer about a severance package. Those \ncircumstances have been outside of his control. While he chose to resolve his earlier \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ndebts by means of a bankruptcy, he has disputed all of the SOR alleged debts on the \nbasis that he does not believe he is responsible for them because the medical debts \nshould have been paid by insurance companies, and he believes he has a legitimate \ndispute with his past employer about his severance pay. I find this potentially mitigating \ncondition has some application.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant did not present evidence that he \nobtained formal credit counseling; however, he submitted copies of letters that he sent \nto creditors in December 2008 requesting verification of the alleged debts in order to \nresolve them. He submitted his budget, which indicates that his current financial \nobligations are under control. This mitigating condition has some application. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is fully applicable in this case. It provides mitigation when \u201can \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provided evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant produced \nevidence that he disputed 11 debts in December 2008 because he believes the medical \ndebts were paid by insurance companies. He testified that he again disputed the debts \nin September 2009. As a result of his dispute letters, 13 debts were removed or deleted \nfrom his credit record. He continues to dispute the largest alleged debt based on his \nunderstanding of his severance package and may seek legal assistance. In October \n2009, he learned that two medical debts have been verified as being his debts. He has \nessentially attempted to resolve all of the 17 SOR debts through the dispute process \nwith the credit reporting agency.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 33-year-old man, who \nhonorably served his country for four years in the military. After leaving the service, his \nwife and daughter experienced severe medical conditions that created significant debt, \nwhich was later discharged through a bankruptcy. Since that 2004 discharge, credit \nbureau reports have indicated that he has accumulated more delinquent debts, but also \nreport that he is current on many financial obligations. Applicant has repeatedly denied \nowning the alleged debts and challenged all of them. At this time, the largest debt of \n$18,263 appears to relate to a legitimate dispute that he has with his previous employer \nand does not create a security concern. Two medical debts that total $4,784 have \nrecently been confirmed to be his debts and need to be resolved. All other debts, \ntotaling $2,960, are resolved.  \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. There is no other evidence \nin his background to indicate that a financial dispute with his former employer or two \nmedical bills that total less than $5,000 may create a security risk. For all these reasons, \nconclude \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \nsecurity \nconcerns \narising \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On January 30, 2009, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on February 12, 2009, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. Pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural\nGuidance at Enclosure 3 of the Directive, Department Counsel requested that a hearing\nbe held in this case. (Transcript at 8-9.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non March 3, 2009. I received the case assignment on March 5, 2009. DOHA issued a\n\nBecause of the particular factual situation in this case, at the request of the Applicant, and with the express\n1\nunderstanding of the Department Counsel, the record was left open for an  extended period of time. This is\npursuant to my authority under Paragraph E3.1.9. of the Additional Procedural Guidance at Enclosure 3 of\nthe Directive, which states, \u201cThe Administrative Judge may rule on questions on procedure, discovery and\nevidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner.\u201d  (Transcript at 68-70.)  \nAn \u201c80/20 split\u201d refers to a situation where the borrower takes out two mortgages that pay 100% of the\n2\npurchase price for a house, using an 80% loan and a 20% loan.  These loans can be with the same or different\nlenders.\n2\nnotice of hearing on April 8, 2009, setting the hearing for May 19, 2009. The hearing\nwas convened on that date.  \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through H, without objection. The Applicant requested that the record remain\nopen for the submission of additional documents. The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits I through P at various dates ending on August 17, 2009, and they were\nreceived without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 27,\n1\n2009. The record closed on August 17, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 37, married, and has a Master\u2019s degree. He is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in\nconnection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially\noverextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds. The\nApplicant admitted allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f. under this guideline. Those\nadmissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  He denied allegation 1.e.\nThe Applicant served on active duty in the United States Army for 13 years. His\ncareer was very successful and he left with the rank of Staff Sergeant. (Government\nExhibit 6; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 5-10.) The Applicant left active duty to pursue civilian\nopportunities in his field of expertise, and to advance in the Navy Reserve.  (Transcript\nat 31-39.)\nOnce the Applicant began working in his civilian career, he found that his income\nalmost doubled, to over $100,000 a year. This lasted from about 2003 to 2007. During\nthis time the Applicant and his wife bought a house using an 80/20 split.  They also\n2\nused several credit cards to pay for improvements to the house, as well as other\nhousehold expenses, and the wife\u2019s medical care when their child was born. When the\n\n3\nApplicant became unemployed for several months in 2007, their financial situation\nbecame untenable. (Transcript at 54-63.)\nWhen they were unable to pay the mortgage, the Applicant and his wife\ndownsized their expenses. They have been on a stable budget for the past two years,\nand are able to pay their current debts. He has also been working to resolve his past\ndue indebtedness.  (Transcript at 27-30, 63-66.) As part of his attempts to resolve his\nindebtedness, the Applicant considered bankruptcy and had extensive discussions with\na bankruptcy law firm.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) He decided against filing for bankruptcy,\nin part, because of the family trust, discussed immediately below.\nAn additional factor in this case is a family trust, of which the Applicant is a\nbeneficiary. The Applicant presented substantial documentary evidence, in addition to\nhis credible testimony, describing the trust. Due to a family disagreement, which is no\nfault of the Applicant\u2019s, the funds had not been distributed as of the date of the hearing.\nThe Applicant\u2019s part of the trust, when distributed, is estimated at $400,000. (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit C; Transcript at 28-30, 49-51, 65-67.)  \nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $22,490\nfor a credit card.  The Applicant successfully paid this debt for a negotiated amount\n($15,800) on June 9, 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I, Exhibit J and Exhibit K; Transcript at\n42-43.)  \nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $17,343\nfor a second credit card. The Applicant successfully paid this debt on July 10, 2009.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 3, Exhibit K at 2, and Exhibit M; Transcript at 43.) \nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $19,914 for\na third credit card. The Applicant successfully paid this debt on July 23, 2009.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 2, and Exhibit N; Transcript at 43.) \nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $82,620\nfor a second mortgage on his primary residence. As described further under 1.f., below,\nthe house was foreclosed upon by the primary mortgage holder.  Because he had\nrefinanced this loan, the second mortgage remained as a personal responsibility of the\nApplicant.  The Applicant successfully paid this debt for a negotiated amount ($20,000)\non June 30, 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L, and Exhibit P; Transcript at 46.) \nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant denied that he was currently indebted to a\nstate\u2019s tax authority in the amount of $751. He provided documentary evidence showing\nthat the subject tax lien (Government Exhibit 2) was released on January 20, 1998.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B; Transcript at 45-46.)\nSubparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant admits that he owed $323,981 for a first\nmortgage on his principal residence. When the Applicant became unemployed he\nquickly burned through his savings trying to make the mortgage payments. The\n\n4\nApplicant and his wife made the decision to turn the house back to the lender because\nthey could not make the payments, and were unable to make a short sale. \nThe mortgage holder took back the property in July 2007, and held a foreclosure\nsale in approximately February 2008. The state\u2019s anti-deficiency statute applied, which\nmeans that the mortgage holder is held to the amount received in the foreclosure sale\nand the Applicant has no current debt to them. This is confirmed by the Government\u2019s\nmost recent credit report, which shows there being no amount past due on this debt.\n(Government Exhibit 7 at 2.) The Applicant also submitted a credit report which states,\nconcerning this debt, \u201cCredit Grantor reclaimed collateral to settle defaulted mortgage.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 7-8.) (See Transcript at 46-49.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted his evaluation for the past year, as well as work and\nmilitary related awards and commendations. The documents show that he was a highly\nrespected soldier, and is a successful member of the defense industry. (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s current supervisor, a senior vice-president, submitted a letter on\nthe Applicant\u2019s behalf. This gentleman states, \u201cDespite the circumstances that led to the\nforeclosure in February 2008, [the Applicant] has proven to be a professional of the\nhighest integrity, unquestionable ethics, and strong moral character.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A at 1-2.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG \u00b6\n19(a) states that, \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d maybe disqualifying. Under\n\n6\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may also raise security\nconcerns. The Applicant admits that he owed the debts set forth in SOR subparagraphs\n1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f. The record evidence shows that he had successfully\nresolved subparagraph 1.e. in 1998. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c) applies when,\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d Finally, under\nAG \u00b6 20(d), it is a mitigating factor where \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nThe Applicant, by his own account, made a poor financial choice in buying a\nhome when he was doing well financially. Like many people today, he has lost that\ninvestment when he became unemployed for several months. However, he then acted\nin an intelligent manner by downsizing his household, finding full-time employment, and\nattempting to resolve his debts. The Applicant has been able to pay his current bills for\nseveral years, and has paid a substantial amount of money towards the arrearage.  The\nthree debts he owed to credit card companies, and his second mortgage, have been\ncompletely paid off. This is confirmed by documentary evidence from the creditors. As\nfor his first mortgage, that debt is no longer due and owing because of the foreclosure\nsale and his state\u2019s anti-deficiency statute.    \nI find the behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur, and it does not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment. The evidence shows that the problem is under control and that the\nsituation will not be repeated. He has a firm grasp of his financial situation, and has\nshown that he can be relied upon in the future. The evidence raises all the mitigating\nconditions discussed above.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.  In addition, the administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \n\n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant got into financial\ndifficulty because of a relatively short but devastating span of unemployment.  He has a\nplan to pay all of his debts and has fulfilled it. The Applicant has behaved reasonably\nand appropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG \u00b6 2(a)(6) applies. Under the\nparticular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is little to no likelihood of\nrecurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  He is currently eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked for two and a half years as a rigger and commercial truck driver. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations were true, with some explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact. Applicant served in the Navy from 1991 to 1995, and the Army from 1996 to 1998 when he was discharged with a disability. While in the Navy, he had a girlfriend for a couple years who subsequently had a son and named him the father on official records. She later filed for child support, which he only discovered when he first applied for his commercial driver\u2019s licence in 1998. He has not spoken to the mother since 1996, and has never been able to make contact with his son. Between March 1996 and January 2008, he was under a county court order to pay the mother $341 per month in child support. Over those years, he sporadically made payments totaling $8,786. With assessed interest on delinquent payments, his total due to the county in January 2008 was $66,148. (AE C at 4-6; Tr. at 31-38, 57-59.) In September 2008, Applicant\u2019s employer began deducting $203.22 from his biweekly paychecks for payment of child support. This results in an average monthly payment of $441, which Applicant understood to be $341 for current support and $100 toward the delinquent debt. (AE B at 2; Tr. at 36, 49.) The county reported a balance due of $65,595 in November 2008.",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owed more than $66,000 in delinquent child support in January 2008\nwhen he applied for a security clearance. He also had state tax liens for more than\n$3,700 in overpayment of unemployment compensation filed in 2003 and 2007. He\nrepaid almost $4,300 of these debts through garnishment and payroll deduction starting\nin September 2008. He denied any delinquent debt on his security clearance\napplication, and failed to mitigate resulting financial and personal conduct security\nconcerns. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on\nJanuary 4, 2008. On November 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nJune 5, 2009\n\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 3, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on December 12, 2008, and requested a determination be made\nwithout a hearing \u201cunless further explanation or information is required.\u201d On January 20,\n2009, Department Counsel ascertained in a telephone conversation that Applicant\nactually did desire a hearing and converted the case to request a hearing before an\nadministrative judge pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed on January 30, 2009, and DOHA assigned the case to me on February 5,\n2009.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 17, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on March 10, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B. I granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest to leave the record open until March 24, 2009, to permit submission of\nadditional evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 19,\n2009. On April 9, 2009, Department Counsel forwarded Applicant\u2019s additional\nsubmissions without objection to their consideration. These documents were collectively\nmarked AE C, admitted, and the record was closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor two and a half years as a rigger and commercial truck driver. In his answer to the\nSOR, he admitted all of the allegations were true, with some explanations. Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact.\nApplicant served in the Navy from 1991 to 1995, and the Army from 1996 to 1998\nwhen he was discharged with a disability. While in the Navy, he had a girlfriend for a\ncouple years who subsequently had a son and named him the father on official records.\nShe later filed for child support, which he only discovered when he first applied for his\ncommercial driver\u2019s licence in 1998. He has not spoken to the mother since 1996, and\nhas never been able to make contact with his son. Between March 1996 and January\n2008, he was under a county court order to pay the mother $341 per month in child\nsupport. Over those years, he sporadically made payments totaling $8,786. With\nassessed interest on delinquent payments, his total due to the county in January 2008\nwas $66,148. (AE C at 4-6; Tr. at 31-38, 57-59.) \nIn September 2008, Applicant\u2019s employer began deducting $203.22 from his\nbiweekly paychecks for payment of child support. This results in an average monthly\npayment of $441, which Applicant understood to be $341 for current support and $100\ntoward the delinquent debt. (AE B at 2; Tr. at 36, 49.) The county reported a balance\ndue of $65,595 in November 2008. (GE 3 at 1.) Applicant provided an account\nstatement from the county prepared on March 13, 2009, purporting to show all of his\ndebts, that reflected no charges for child support or interest after January 2008, but\n\n3\nprovided no other evidence concerning whether his child support obligations continue.\nHe was not aware of his son\u2019s actual age. (AE C at 4-6; Tr. at 59.) Between September\n2008 and February 2009, a total of $2,642 was garnished from his wages for child\nsupport. (AE B at 2.)\nApplicant\u2019s current state of residence filed tax liens against him in the amounts of\n$985 in April 2003, $2,739 in June 2007, and $2,193 in September 2008. It is unclear\nfrom the evidence whether these represent three distinct debts, or updated amounts on\nthe same outstanding debt. Applicant explained his understanding that these liens\nresulted from his receipt of more unemployment compensation than he was entitled to\nduring periods he was briefly out of work with previous employers as a truck driver. His\ngirlfriend, with whom he lived for ten years, was handling their joint finances at the time.\nHe was unaware the state had obtained the judgments against him on which the liens\nwere based until his employer began garnishing his wages for them in November 2008.\n(GE 2 at 3; GE 4; Tr. at 34, 38-39.) That garnishment is also $203.22 per paycheck.\nApplicant\u2019s payroll clerk annotated, on the printout showing these deductions, that the\ninitial amount requested in this garnishment action was $2,254, and after the February\n2009 payments he had paid $1,626 and still owed $628. (AE B at 1.) \nApplicant stopped living with the woman who had been handling their finances\nand her two children in October 2008 due to her dissatisfaction with his income after his\nchild support garnishment of over $400 per month began. He moved in with a long-time\nfriend and the friend\u2019s wife, and currently pays about $1,400 per month in rent and\nvehicle expenses. His income varies based on number of hours worked, but he\nestimated his net take home after all deductions at $1,600 to $1,800 per month, plus an\nadditional $974 in monthly VA disability payments. Other than child support and the tax\nliens, Applicant\u2019s other debts have been generally paid on time. He said he would\ncomplete a Personal Financial Statement form provided to him by Department Counsel\nand submit it after the hearing, but did not do so. (GE 3; AE C at 2, 3; Tr. at 44-47, 54.)  \nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86 in January 2008, he said he had not had\nany debts delinquent by 180 days during the last 7 years, and had no debts currently\n90-days delinquent. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained:\nI admit that I answered no to [Questions 28a and 28b]. I was not\nintentionally misleading or un-truthful. I have been making payments on\nthe account brought into question which I thought meant I was current in\nmy payments. I did not understand that neither the arrears amount for\nchild support nor the tax liens would be considered to be past due as I\nhave been making these payments via payroll deduction and was unaware\nthat any amounts in arrears would be considered as past due amounts.\nPrior to October 2008 I was not handling my personal finances and did not\nknow that the debt(s) to [state] Employment Security Department had not\nand were not being paid. I understand it is my responsibility to have\nknowledge and insure that my financial obligations are handled properly. I\nhave remedied this situation and am making payments as necessary to\n\n4\nresolve the issue that have been brought forth as part of your\ninvestigation.\nDuring the hearing, he reiterated that he did not know about the tax liens until his\nemployer began garnishing his wages for them in November 2008. However, he\nadmitted that he did know about the child support delinquency, and had not been\nmaking recent payments toward it around the time he completed his SF 86. He\nexplained, \u201cI guess this is just something that I was trying to get through it at work, trying\nto make it as easy as possible to go through the stuff at work with my bosses sitting\nthere.\u201d (Tr. at 40-42; 51.) The county account printout confirms that his last payment\nbefore January 2008 was in May 2006, and the two payments before that were in March\nand May of 2005. (AE C at 5-6.) Applicant further clarified that he had been informed\nabout the overpayment of unemployment benefits during three different years, but\n\u201cwhen I received notice of that, I just basically gave it to my ex to take care of to pay\nback because I didn\u2019t want that as a lien or a judgment on me.\u201d He continued, \u201cthen\nwhen they said there was an overpayment, I was like, \u2018Okay. No problem. I\u2019ll take care\nof it.\u2019 And it never got taken care of.\u201d (Tr. at 54-56.)\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote that they have worked closely together for 16\nmonths, and commented on his professionalism, dedication, strong work ethic,\ntimeliness, conscientiousness, and willingness to help others. His longtime friend and\ncurrent landlord wrote that Applicant is an upstanding individual who is only trying to live\nhis life in a respectable way. He further commented that Applicant views his current\nwork as a way of supporting his country after having been discharged from military\nservice for medical reasons. (AE C at 3.) Applicant offered no evidence of financial\ncounseling, and did not demonstrate a knowledgeable grasp of his budget or other\nfinancial circumstances.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel asserted, and the evidence supports, the applicability\n\n6\nof two of these potentially disqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d (Tr. at 62.) One\nother disqualifying condition could also be implicated by the existence of tax liens: \u201c(g)\nfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required, or fraudulent\nfiling of the same.\u201d Applicant admitted the existence of the tax liens, but they do not\ncorrespond to any failure to file or pay taxes so AG \u00b6 19(g) is inapplicable. The\nundisputed evidence demonstrated Applicant\u2019s inability to pay delinquent child support\ndebt in excess of $65,000, and unwillingness to do so until his wages were garnished,\nthus raising security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a). The evidence also established a\nlengthy history of not meeting these financial obligations that supports security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 19(c). The evidence of record raises questions about Applicant\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and willingness to abide by rules and regulations under which people\nare expected to fulfill their lawful financial obligations.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from\nfinancial considerations. The only potentially applicable conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nAG \u00b6 20(a) provides no mitigation because more than $65,000 in delinquent\ndebt, incurred regularly over the past ten to twelve years, continues to be outstanding.\nThe past ten years\u2019 worth of child support went largely unpaid because Applicant chose\nto support his girlfriend and her children rather than comply with the court order to\nprovide support for his son. This pattern and the amount of remaining debt support\nsubstantial doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6\n20(b) also provides little to no mitigation since he did not act responsibly toward either\n\n7\nhis ongoing child support obligations or his receipt of unwarranted unemployment\ncompensation after becoming aware of them. There is no evidence of counseling and\nlittle indication the problems will be resolved anytime soon. At the $100 per month rate\nthat Applicant testified he is repaying back child support, it would take more than 54\nyears to repay $65,000 in debt. Furthermore, Applicant did not initiate any effort to\nrepay or resolve any of these debts, all of which are being addressed through recently\nobtained involuntary garnishments. Thus, no mitigation is established under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n20(c) or (d). Finally, Applicant neither asserted nor provided evidence to support\napplication of AG \u00b6 20(e).\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The Government asserted that Applicant\u2019s statements and actions support\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16(a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\n\n8\nApplicant completed his SF 86 personnel security questionnaire in January 2008.\nOn the two questions that asked whether he had experienced financial delinquencies he\nresponded \u201cNo,\u201d and did not report what he then knew to be substantial delinquent child\nsupport debt. He did this because he did not want to reveal this adverse information,\neither to his bosses or to the Government. This was a deliberate omission,\nconcealment, and falsification of relevant facts from his SF 86, establishing security\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16(a), as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security\nconcerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), (c) and (f) are not supported by the evidence in this case. Applicant\nacknowledged the relevant facts concerning his financial history and present debts only\nin response to specific confrontation. His claim in response to the SOR that he thought\nthe debts were not delinquent because he had begun repayment agreements is patently\n\n9\nfalse, since he completed the SF 86 in January 2008 and the repayments, through\ninvoluntary garnishment actions, did not begin until September and November 2008,\nrespectively. Finally, the falsification occurred recently and in connection with seeking\nthe clearance that is currently under adjudication, reflecting directly on his reliability and\ntrustworthiness in security-related matters. \nApplicant neither asserted nor offered evidence that he was advised to falsify his\nSF 86, or has taken any positive steps to lessen the likelihood of recurrence or reduce\nhis vulnerability to exploitation and duress. Accordingly, no mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n17(b), (d) or (e) was established. Finally, AG \u00b6 17(g) relates to personal conduct\nconcerns not alleged in this case.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involves more than ten years of failure to pay court ordered child support\nresulting in more than $65,000 in delinquent debt. Even with ongoing garnishment at\npresent rates, it will be many years before this debt is resolved so continuation and\nrecurrence are likely. He did not initiate actions to repay either this debt or his several\ndebts that arose from collecting more unemployment compensation than he was entitled\nto receive. Both are being recouped through creditor garnishment actions. He offered no\nevidence negating his ongoing potential for pressure, coercion or duress. His deliberate\nfalsification of his security clearance application, by denying the existence of his\ndelinquent child support debt, further demonstrates his susceptibility to conceal\nimportant security-related information that might entail personally detrimental\nconsequences, and willingness to compromise his integrity.  \n\n10\nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate the significant\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness security concerns arising from his history of\nfinancial irresponsibility, inability to pay his debts, and falsification of his SF 86. The\nrecord evidence leaves substantial doubt as to his present eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, Applicant has not mitigated security concerns\nrelated to his financial considerations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Trent, Esquire \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling \nabout $75,000. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s arrest and confinement caused more than an \n80% reduction in her family income, and most of their debts became delinquent, \nincluding their mortgage. She worked hard, increasing her income, and reducing her \nexpenses. She obtained a divorce and filed for bankruptcy. She acted responsibly. \nApplicant mitigated financial considerations. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 11, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to her,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 5 (SOR, dated October 10, 2008). GE 5 is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn October 24, 2008, Applicant signed her SOR response, and she requested a \nhearing (GE 6). Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on November \n17, 2008, and on November 18, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the hearing held \non December 10, 2008, Department Counsel offered three exhibits (GEs 1-3) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 13-14), and Applicant offered 12 exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A-L) \n(Tr. 15-17). There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-3 and AEs A-L (Tr. 14, 17). \nAdditionally, after the hearing Applicant provided four more exhibits, which were \nadmitted without objection (AE M-P). I also admitted the SOR (GE 5), Applicant\u2019s SOR \nresponse (GE 6), and a Hearing Notice (GE 4). I received the transcript on December \n17, 2008.  I received post-hearing exhibits AE M-P on January 14, 2009, and closed the \nrecord that same day. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant admitted in her SOR response that she and/or her husband were \nresponsible for the 14 SOR debts, as listed in the following table: \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nAmount \nSOR \u00b6 \nAmount \nSOR \u00b6 \nAmount \n1.a \n$1,187 \n1.f \n$8,998 \n1.k \n$3,061 \n1.b \n$211 \n1.g \n$11,130 \n1.l \n$25,086 \n1.c \n$70 \n1.h \n$420 \n1.m \n$3,004 \n1.d \n$1,572 \n1.i \n$1,422 \n1.n \n$8,773 \n1.e \n$1,168 \n1.j \n$8,984 \n \n \nTotal of SOR debts 1.a to 1.n is $75,086 \n \nApplicant was making $35 payments on the $70 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.l of $25,086 was owed to her mortgage note holder on her $214,000 \nmortgage. She agreed to provide the mortgage holder a deed in lieu of foreclosure; \nhowever, her husband, who was in jail pending trial, declined to sign the necessary \ndocuments to transfer title. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n                                            \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. The facts in the Statement of Facts are from Applicant\u2019s SOR \nresponse (GE 6), unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant received her bachelors degree in 1994 (Tr. 40). Applicant served on \nactive duty in the Air Force for 12 years from 1983 to 1995 (Tr. 19). She left active duty \nas a technical sergeant (Tr. 19). From 1991 to 1994, her last four years on active duty, \nshe had a top secret clearance (Tr. 20). She left active duty because she had several \nlengthy TDY duties and her absence was having a negative impact on her family (Tr. \n21). Applicant married in 1984 and divorced in 1996 (GE 1). Her first two children were \nborn in 1991 and 1994 (GE 1). Applicant did not receive child support payments from \nher first husband because her second husband adopted her two children from her first \nmarriage (Tr. 44-45). She married the second time in 1996 (GE 1). Her third and fourth \nchildren were born in 1998 and 1999 (GE 1). Prior to her husband\u2019s arrest, she home \nschooled her children, and held part-time employment (Tr. 23). \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was arrested in August 2007 for sexually abusing her \ndaughter. He was held pending trial through the date of Applicant\u2019s hearing on \nDecember 10, 2008. Prior to his arrest, his income from his employment was \napproximately $83,000 per year (AE G, I). At the time of her husband\u2019s arrest, \nApplicant\u2019s salary was about $23,000 per year. As of December 2008, Applicant was \nable to increase her income to about $43,400 per year.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was the primary income earner for their family (Tr. 25). In \n2006, her husband\u2019s income from his employment was $86,486 and from his military \nretirement pay was $15,910 (Tr. 41; AE G, I). In 2006, Applicant\u2019s annual income was \n$1,482 (Tr. 41; AE H). In 2007, Applicant\u2019s annual income was $11,780 (Tr. 40; AE F).  \n \nIn 2007, Applicant found out her husband was sexually abusing her oldest \ndaughter (Tr. 25). She informed the police and her husband was arrested in August \n2007 (Tr. 25). In September 2007, an assistant state attorney issued a 39-count \ninformation charging Applicant\u2019s husband with sexual abuse of his stepdaughter \nbetween May and August 2007 (AE J). He has been held in confinement since his \narrest (Tr. 26). The prosecutors have told her that they expect to prosecute her husband \nunless he pleads guilty (Tr. 43-44).   \n \nApplicant left the family residence, and she and her four children initially stayed \nwith a friend (Tr. 27). She started renting a home on October 15, 2007 (Tr. 27). Her \nhusband\u2019s income from his employment stopped when he was arrested (Tr. 27). She \nreceived his military retirement pay from August 2007 to January 2008; however, at that \npoint he changed his allotments (Tr. 28). At that time, she was earning $1,600 a month \nfrom her part-time employment (Tr. 28). Her debts were not delinquent prior to her \nhusband\u2019s arrest (Tr. 28). After his arrest, she was able to afford basic necessities such \nas food, utilities and rent, and counseling for her son; but, not funds for her mortgage, \ncredit cards and family debts (Tr. 29, 30). She received food stamps from January \nthrough April 2008 (Tr. 37). A victim\u2019s aid fund paid for her daughter\u2019s counseling and \nprescription drugs (Tr. 29). She enrolled her children in public schools in August 2007 \n(Tr. 29-30). She also receives $224 monthly from the Veteran\u2019s Administration for \ndisability (Tr. 30). After he was arrested, she contacted all of their creditors and asked if \nshe could make minimal payments because of the decrease in family income (Tr. 31). \n\n \n \n4 \n \nShe made $35 payments to the SOR creditor in \u00b6 1.c, which is the only creditor that \nwould agree to such small payments (Tr. 31). The family owned two time shares and a \nhome (Tr. 31-33). She wanted to sign a quit claim on her property interests in return for \na release on the debts; however, her husband declined to cooperate and would not sign \ndocuments to resolve these issues (Tr. 32-33). Her residence is vacant, and the \nmortgage holder is attempting to sell it (Tr. 46). All of the SOR debts predate her \nhusband\u2019s arrest (Tr. 45). She lives within her current income (Tr. 45). She does not \nhave any car loans, is not responsible for any student loans, and has no delinquent tax \ndebts (Tr. 51).  \n \nApplicant received advice from credit counselors in 2007 (Tr. 33; AE B). She \nestablished a budget; but the counselor advised her to file for bankruptcy because of \nthe scope of the family debt and the lack of income to address that debt (Tr. 34; AE B). \nShe had to establish her residence in the state where she lived for several additional \nmonths so that she could file for divorce where she currently lived (Tr. 34). Her attorney \nadvised her to resolve her divorce, and then file for bankruptcy (Tr. 34, 42-43). She filed \nfor a divorce on January 7, 2008 (Tr. 35; AE C). She was unable to receive child \nsupport until she filed for a contempt citation against her husband in April 2008 (Tr. 36). \nThe court ordered $657 monthly in child support, which was garnished from his \nretirement pay starting in September 2008 (Tr. 37). Her divorce hearing was in early \nDecember 2008, and her divorce was approved on December 12, 2008, with issues of \nvisitation, alimony and child support to be adjudicated at subsequent proceedings (Tr. \n42; AE N). The divorce decree barred Applicant\u2019s husband from contacting her or \ncoming within 500 yards of her home, business, or other place where she may be \npresent (AE N).   \n \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy on January 9, 2009 (AE O, P). She listed assets of \nreal property valued at $28,000 and personal property valued at about $3,500 (AE P). \nCreditors holding secured claims totaled about $27,000 and unsecured nonpriority \nclaims totaled about $485,500 (AE P). She included her husband\u2019s property, which had \na $139,000 mortgage, as well as the mortgage on the residence they owned jointly of \n$214,000 (AE P). Her bankruptcy filing also listed the two timeshares, which she valued \nat $28,000, and on which she owed more than $25,000 (AE P). Her most significant \nunencumbered asset is her 1999 Plymouth Voyager, which she valued at about $900 \n(AE P).   \n \nApplicant has substantially increased her income. In April 2008, a government \ncontractor hired Applicant at a salary of $42,000 per year (Tr. 38). After five months, the \ncontractor increased her annual salary to $43,400 and gave her a $500 bonus (Tr. 38-\n39; AE E). In July 2008, she enrolled in an on-line masters degree program (Tr. 39). Her \nemployer pays her tuition (Tr. 39). So far all of her grades are As (Tr. 39).   \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \n\n \n \n5 \n \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \n\n \n \n6 \n \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n   \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude relevant security concerns are under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had . \n.  .  SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in her credit report, her SOR response, her statement at her \nhearing, and her bankruptcy filing. The government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nThe ongoing nature of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt is \u201ca continuing course of \nconduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence because those delinquent debts have \nnot yet been discharged by the bankruptcy court. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(c) fully apply. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts resulted \nfrom a condition beyond her control, and she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.3 Her delinquent debts also \u201coccurred under such circumstances that \n[they are] unlikely to recur and [do] not cast doubt on [her] current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Prior to her husband\u2019s arrest in August 2007, \nApplicant and her husband did not have any delinquent debt. After his arrest, \nconfinement, and termination of his employment, the family income was reduced by \nmore than 80%. The family accounts became delinquent. She obtained financial and \nmarital/divorce counseling and advice. She then followed that advice. She significantly \nreduced her expenses and increased her income. Her income and new expenses are in \nbalance. She obtained a divorce and filed for bankruptcy to end her responsibility for \nmarital debt. She pays any new debts that arise, and as such lives within her means. \nHer problems are unlikely to recur because she is no longer married and has a court \norder barring her former spouse from contacting Applicant. She understands the \nimportance of financial responsibility and has demonstrated the required self-discipline \nto avoid future delinquent debt.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) fully applies because Applicant established that she showed good \nfaith4 in the resolution of her delinquent SOR debts. She and her husband paid their \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \ndebts before her husband was arrested and confined. After her family lost about 80% of \ntheir income, some debts could not be paid. She contacted her creditors and attempted \nto keep her accounts current, offering small payments in return for keeping her accounts \nin current status. However, all creditors except for one small account holder declined to \naccept the small payments and she filed for bankruptcy. Under the circumstances, \nbankruptcy was a prudent and reasonable response to her financial predicament. As \nindicated previously, she lives within her means and follows her budget. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. She did not dispute any delinquent SOR debts.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s overall conduct in regard to her delinquent debt does not cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She was confronted \nwith daunting financial problems when her husband was arrested for sexual molestation \nof her eldest daughter. More than eighty percent of the family income suddenly stopped. \nShe is a single mother and she is responsible for four minor children. She acted \nprudently and responsibly, and is taking good care of her children. Her admirable \nqualities of self-discipline and dedication to her family are evident. Based on my \nevaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude financial considerations are \nfully mitigated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s dedication to her work and her country is a very positive indication of \nher good character and trustworthiness. She is loyal to her country. She honourably \nserved on active duty for 12 years and held a top secret clearance for the last four years \nof her military service. Her record of good employment and law-abiding character \nweighs in her favor. There is no evidence of any security violation, or criminal activity. \nHer financial problems arose from her husband\u2019s criminal sexual abuse of Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter, and not from any lack of judgment or dereliction by Applicant. She reduced \nher expenses and increased her income, and she brought her budget into balance. She \ndoes not have any new delinquent debt. These factors show solid responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concern. I take this position based on the law, as set \nforth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of \nthe whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent \nfactors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For \nthe reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.n: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On March 31, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in failing\nto apply Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FCDC) (b); whether the Judge erred in\nhis application of the mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge erred in his whole-person\nanalysis.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 58-year-old executive\nassistant working for a Defense contractor.  She earns around $96,000 a year in salary and retirement\nbenefits.  She has a degree from an accredited university.\nApplicant is in debt resulting from two real estate purchases.  She is indebted to one\nmortgagee on an account that is $18,799 past due.  This debt is in foreclosure, the balance on the\nloan being $63,750.  She is indebted to a second mortgagee on an account that is $45,399 past due.\nThis property is also in foreclosure, the balance of the loan being $380,000.  Neither debt has been\npaid.  Applicant submitted \u201cno evidence of subsequent payment[.]\u201d Decision at 2.\nIn late 2005 or early 2006, Applicant answered an ad in a newspaper which she believed\nmight lead to a career in real estate.  The Judge quoted Applicant: \u201cAt that time, everyone was\ngetting in on making money by flipping real estate.\u201d  As a consequence of answering the ad,\nApplicant met with a man (P) who proposed \u201cto use her credit for six months to purchase houses.\u201d\nFor each house purchased, Applicant would make $10,000.  The houses would be fixed up and\nquickly resold \u201cat a competitive price.\u201d  Id.\n\nItem 3, Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR, contains a copy of this joint venture agreement.  This agreement\n1\nstates that P would pay Applicant $5,000 up front and the remaining $5,000 after the property has been transferred\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d from Applicant\u2019s name to P\u2019s name.  \nThe joint venture agreement states that P is \u201cthe principle party\u201d of LLC.\n2\n\u201cIn her response to the SOR, Applicant refers to two separate houses, both of which were apparently worth less\n3\nthan the value of the loans.  As stated above, the Judge also found that Applicant and P purchased two houses.  However,\nthe joint venture agreement appears to reference only one house, listing only one address rather than two.  It is not clear\nwhether the two SOR allegations refer to two houses or to two mortgages obtained on one house as part of the financing\narrangement.  For example, in Item 3 Applicant states that one house was purportedly valued at $575,000 and the other\nat $425,000.  The two SOR allegations refer respectively to two mortgages, one with a balance of $63,750 and the other\nwith a balance of $380,000.  This apparent discrepancy is not explained in the record.  If the first allegation is supposed\nto refer to the first house, there is no explanation as to how the amount of the loan was paid down so significantly.   See\nDepartment Counsel Brief at 4, n. 16: \u201cNote that Applicant discusses that she purchased two homes in this same manner.\nOnly one property appears to be showing up as a foreclosure.  There is no evidence regarding the status of the other\nproperty.\u201d   \n3\nIn May 2006, Applicant entered into a joint venture with P and his limited liability\ncorporation (LLC).  The agreement was to be in effect for one year for the purpose of selling property\nand, should the property not sell within that year, the agreement was to expire.  The agreement stated\nthat Applicant would receive $5,000 up front and the remaining $10,000 after purchasing the\nproperty.   The property would be transferred to LLC after six months, and, if that transfer did not\n1\noccur, the LLC would pay Applicant an additional $5,000.   LLC was to make the mortgage\n2\npayments for one year and would lease the properties from Applicant.  The agreement stipulated that\nLLC would be named on the deeds while Applicant would be named on the mortgages.  \nTwo houses were purchased in Applicant\u2019s name.  The rent checks owed by P/LLC bounced.\nSubsequently, Applicant went to view the properties for the first time.  She discovered that they were\nin substantial need of repair.  One had extensive water damage; the other had a flooded basement\n\u201cand the garage was pulling away from the house.  A contractor working across the street told\n[Applicant] that [P] had a bad reputation and that he would not deal with him.\u201d   Decision at 3.  \n3\nApplicant believed the appraiser had submitted a false report concerning the properties.  She\nlater discovered that she could not make contact with P, so she began investigating him.  She\ndiscovered that he had been fired from a previous real estate company for \u201cshady dealing.\u201d  \u201cShe has\nsince filed charges against the man for bad checks.  She is helping her mortgage company investigate\nthe matter as fraudulent and is helping another victim in her legal suit against the man.\u201d  Id.  The\nJudge found that Applicant has taken responsibility for the mortgages but that they are too much for\nher.  The properties have gone into foreclosure, which she believes was her only option, bankruptcy\nbeing \u201cthe coward\u2019s way out.\u201d  Id.  \nB.  Discussion\n\n4\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nThroughout Department Counsel\u2019s brief she asserts that the Judge\u2019s decision is unsupported\nby the weight of the record evidence.  The Board will address this concern in the discussion below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\n5\nThe security concern under Guideline F is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE2.18.  Department Counsel agrees that the evidence supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the\ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s case raise FCDCs.  However, Department Counsel contends that the\nJudge\u2019s favorable application of the Financial Conditions Mitigating Conditions (FCMC) is not\nsupported by record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  The Judge applied FCMC\n20(b), which mitigates security concerns when \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances[.]\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b).  Department Counsel contends that the record is not\nsufficiently developed to sustain the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was a victim of fraud.  The\nBoard notes this argument.  While there is evidence to demonstrate that P has been charged with\nfraud arising out of numerous real estate ventures, there is little evidence to resolve reasonable\nquestions as to the nature of Applicant\u2019s involvement.   However, even assuming that Applicant was\na victim of fraud, the record evidence does not sustain the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusion as to FCMC\n20(b).  For example, record evidence demonstrates that a stranger proposed to use Applicant\u2019s good\ncredit history as a basis for obtaining real estate.  This alone could have prompted a reasonable\nperson not to participate in the venture.  Furthermore, Applicant failed to perform a prior inspection\nof the property, the address of which was listed in the written agreement.   The Judge\u2019s decision does\nnot seriously address the significance of this evidence; rather, he states, without sufficient analysis,\nthat Applicant \u201chad no indication she was being set up, nor did she have reason to suspect anything\nwas awry.\u201d  Decision at 6.  This statement is not consistent with the evidence described above, nor\nis it even consistent with the plain terms of the joint venture agreement, which obligate P, after six\nmonths, only to \u201cstart the process\u201d of transferring the purchased property to his name, and to pay\nApplicant the full balance owed under the agreement only \u201c[w]henever the transference is\ncomplete[.]\u201d  However, the agreement also provides that if the subject property has not been sold\nwithin a year, the agreement will expire, which could have placed a reasonable person on notice that\nhe or she could well end up with ultimate responsibility for the mortgage loan.  Item 3, Response to\nSOR.  The record does not sustain a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s debt arose from causes outside her\ncontrol.  \nFurthermore, Department Counsel argues persuasively that the record does not support the\nsecond clause of FCMC 20(b), that Applicant has acted responsibly in regard to the debt.  In the first\nplace, the fact of incurring this debt under the circumstances of this case is not consistent with\nresponsible behavior.  Second, there is no evidence, other than the fact that the property is subject\nto foreclosure, to demonstrate what action Applicant proposes to discharge a facially valid debt to\nthe mortgagee.  This paucity of record evidence is significant, insofar as it is foreseeable that the\nforeclosure sale could result in a deficiency, given Applicant\u2019s admission that the property is not\n\nSee Item 3, Response to SOR, Letter to Attorney General.  \u201cWhen I went to see [the house] there were water\n4\nstains in the living room from upstairs and there was water damage in the basement.  A lady was living in the house.  This\nlady was the previous owner of the house. [P] had told her she could rent the house for a year and then buy it back.  She\ntook me around and showed me all the damage.\u201d  Referring to a second house, Applicant stated that it \u201cwas in worse\nshape than the first one.  This house was valued at $425,000.00.  When I first saw it I was shocked.  I would not have\npaid $200,000 for it.  The garage was pulling away from the house.\u201d  See note 3 above regarding the apparent\ndiscrepancies in the record concerning whether there were two houses or one that were the subject of the agreement\ncontained in Item 3.    \nApplicant introduces new evidence in her reply brief.  The Board cannot consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence\n5\non appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nSee also the Judge\u2019s finding, referenced above, and record evidence that  P or his LLC were to be placed on\n6\nthe deed.  However, the record demonstrates that his name was not on the mortgage document, which remains in\nApplicant\u2019s name alone.  Decision at 3; Item 3, Response to SOR, Joint Venture Agreement.        \n6\nworth the value of the loan.   Department Counsel cites evidence that Applicant has a college degree,\n4\nthat she owns two rental properties, and that she owns investment accounts.  The record does not\nsuggest that she is penurious or otherwise incapable of arranging a satisfactory means of addressing\nthis debt.  \nThe Judge also states that FCMC 20(a) \u201cpartially applies.\u201d  This provision of the Directive\nmitigates security concerns when the behavior that gave rise to the debts happened a long time ago,\nwas infrequent, or not likely to recur and which \u201cdoes not case doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 20(a)  The Judge does not provide\nanalysis of this provision.   In light of the discussion above, however, the Board concludes that\nApplicant has not met her burden of persuasion that her case casts no doubt on her good judgment.\nFurthermore, the Board has considered the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis and also concludes that\nit is not sustainable on this record.   The Judge states that P\u2019s proposed venture \u201cwas sufficiently\n5\nsimple as to make sense [however, it] was sufficiently complex in its execution as to obfuscate a less\nthan experienced real estate investor.\u201d  Decision at 8.   However, the Judge\u2019s findings and the record\nas a whole suggest a plan not daunting in its complexity but unreasonable on its face, especially to\na person like Applicant who apparently has some experience in real estate matters, as demonstrated\nby her response to the SOR.  The record contains a number of assertions that raise serious questions\nabout Applicant\u2019s good judgement.  For example, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR includes a letter\nshe wrote to the state attorney general, complaining about P\u2019s activities.  This letter states that \u201cthe\nloan officer that handled my loan said there was something wrong about my loan and she did not like\nit.  She soon after that quit that company.\u201d Item 3.  This reinforces previously discussed record\nevidence as to the facial unreasonableness of Applicant\u2019s undertaking with P.   As Department\n6\nCounsel argues, the questions raised by the evidence are not resolved by the matters Applicant has\nsubmitted in her behalf.  The Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is not supported by the record.\nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.  In light of this conclusion the Board\nneed not address Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge failed to apply FCDC 19(b).  \nOrder\n\n7\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \n  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant answered the SOR 24 March 2009, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 22 April 2009, and I convened a hearing 4 June 2009.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 10 June 2009.\n \nJune 30, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.l. He is a 41-year-old\nmail clerk employed by a defense contractor since September 2008. He previously held\nan unidentified clearance with another government agency in October 2006, when he\nwas also employed as a mail clerk.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits (G.E. 2, 4) confirm, 13 delinquent\ndebts totaling over $30,000. Applicant denies only one debt, for $400. Applicant\nreported delinquent debts on his February 2008 clearance application (G.E. 1), and\nconfirmed many of them during an interview with a government investigator in May 2008\n(G.E. 3).\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are largely attributable to three lengthy periods of\nunemployment and chronic underemployment. He was unemployed from February 2001\nto March 2003 because of an automobile accident in which he lost one arm. He was\nunemployed from January 2004 to June 2005. He was unemployed from November\n2006 to September 2008. He was fired from his current employer because of a policy\ndispute with his supervisors. His dismissal was overturned on appeal, but the company\noffered him a new work location that was too far from his home, so he resigned. While\nhe was unemployed, he survived on social security disability payments and financial\nsupport from his mother. He was later rehired by this company.\nSome of the debts are for medical expenses that were not covered by insurance.\nHe has a deficiency amount due on an automobile repossession, and delinquent a\nnumber of delinquent credit cards. Some of the debts are for delinquent rent that\nresulted in evictions from his homes. One of the evictions was reduced to judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s friend let him live in an apartment, conditioned on payment when Applicant\nreceived damages from a civil suit related to the automobile accident. When Applicant\nlost the suit, his friend evicted him and reduced the back rent to judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories (G.E. 3) documented that he\ncontacted all of his creditors in March 2008, offering minimal monthly payments on each\nof his debts. Most of the creditors did not respond in writing. Several creditors have\noffered substantial discounts with a lump-sum payment by Applicant, but he lacks the\nfunds to take advantage of those offers. Consequently, he has made no payments on\nany of his debts. However, he remains in periodic contact with his creditors and intends\nto repay his debts. He has a mandatory retirement account with his current employer,\nwhich makes matching contributions. There is currently about $5000 in the account, and\nApplicant intends to apply for a hardship liquidation of the account to pay some of his\ndebts when he is eligible to access the account in six months. He asks for a year to get\nhis financial house in order.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . .  \n3\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s credit reports establish his\nindebtedness. He acknowledges most of the debts, and credibly states his intent to\nsatisfy all his creditors. However, he lacks the means to start repayment plans or take\nadvantage of the settlement offers made to him, and that circumstance is unlikely to\nchange in the near future.3\n\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations offer Applicant little solace. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  However, the debts were due to\n4\ncircumstances beyond his control and in some respects he has acted responsibly in\naddressing his debts within his means.  The problem for Applicant is that he has very\n5\nlittle means at present, and appears unlikely to have any greater means in the near\nfuture. Further, there is no evidence that he has sought credit counseling or otherwise\nbrought the problem under control.  None of the alleged debts have been paid, although\n6\nthis has nothing to do with timeliness or good-faith.  Still, with no plan in place to\n7\naddress his debts and no likelihood of a plan in the near future, I cannot conclude that\nApplicant will put his financial problems behind him. I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant. Consideration of the whole person factors yields no different result.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

He was\nconvicted of underage drinking and driving in 2005. He was charged with Driving While\nIntoxicated (DWI) in 2006. He has not driven a vehicle after consuming alcohol since he\nwas charged with DWI in 2006, and he now consumes alcohol responsibly and in\nmoderation. Applicant has mitigated the security concern that was created by his alcohol\nconsumption. \nOn April 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the SOR was received by DOHA on April 23, 2009. Applicant admitted all\nallegations and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nSeptember 23, 2009\n\n 4  Degree Driving W hile Impaired is a misdemeanor in which there is not an aggravating factor\n2\nth\npresent.

A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 15, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 17, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted two documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-2 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified but did not offer any other evidence. The transcript was received on August 25,\n2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 23-year-old single man who has been employed as a welder by a\ndefense contractor since March 2008. He graduated from high school in June 2004, and\nworked steadily at a variety of jobs until he became unemployed in December 2006. He\nattended a technical school from January 2006 until January 2007, from which he received\na certificate in welding. He obtained employment as a welder in April 2007, and he worked\ncontinuously as such for several non-government contractors until he was hired by his\npresent employer. \nApplicant began drinking alcohol with friends when he was about 16 years old. He\nestimates he drank about 12 beers on almost every weekend while he was in high school.\nIn June 2004, and again in December 2004, he was charged with and convicted of\nUnderage Consumption. He was fined about $150, including court costs, following both of\nthese convictions.\nApplicant was charged with Inattentive Driving, Underage Drinking and Driving,\nOpen Bottle Law (Possession), and Underage Consumption on September 25, 2005.\nApplicant testified he had only consumed two drinks over the course of an hour or two\nbefore he was arrested and that while his blood alcohol content (BAC) disclosed he had\nbeen drinking alcohol as a minor he was not intoxicated. (Tr. 47-48) He provided a\nstatement on June 4, 2008, in which he stated his BAC was about 0.04 to 0.06 at the time.\n(GE 2) He pled guilty to and was convicted of Underage Drinking and Driving on March 3,\n2006, and he was sentenced to unsupervised probation for one year and ordered to serve\n45 days in jail (stayed for one year). Additional conditions of his probationary sentence\nincluded no possession of alcohol or drugs and attendance at a Mothers Against Drunk\nDriving (MADD) Impact Panel. Applicant admits he did not benefit from attendance at this\nMADD panel because he thought at the time that he should not have been required to\nattend it since he had not been driving while intoxicated. (Tr. 51)\nApplicant continued to consume alcohol following his March 2006 conviction in\nviolation of his probation. On June 10, 2006, he was charged with 4  Degree Driving While\nth\nImpaired,  Operate a Motor Vehicle - Alcohol Concentration 0.08 Within 2 Hours, and\n2\n\na child under the age of 16 in the motor vehicle. Minn. Stat.\u00a7169A.03.   \n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n3\nUnderage Drinking and Driving. Applicant estimates he had consumed about 12 beers at\na city festival during the course of the day before he was arrested. On April 2, 2007, he\npled guilty to the offense of Operate a Motor Vehicle - Alcohol Concentration 0.08 Within\n2 Hours and the remaining charges were dismissed. He was placed on unsupervised\nprobation for two years, sentenced to serve 45 days in jail (44 days stayed for two years),\nand fined $400. Other terms of probation included attendance at a MADD Impact Panel\nand completion of a 2-day DWI program. Applicant apparently was impacted by his second\nattendance at a MADD panel because as he testified his drinking habits \u201chave gotten a lot\nbetter ever since I\u2019ve had to take my MADD impact panel classes.\u201d (Tr. 29)\nAs a consequence of the conviction, Applicant\u2019s driving privileges were suspended\nby the state for six months following his April 2007 conviction. Despite the suspension,\nApplicant continued to drive to and from work because he was unable to obtain another\nmeans of transportation to get to his place of employment. He was convicted of speeding\non May 31, 2007, of failure to drive in a single lane and driving after suspension on\nSeptember 13, 2007, and no drivers license in possession or failure to display upon\nrequest on September 22, 2008. He was fined as a result of each of these convictions. \nApplicant credibly testified he has neither operated a motor vehicle after consuming\nalcohol nor consumed alcohol while he remained underage since he was convicted of the\nDWI in April 2007. He currently drinks no more than a couple of beers on weekends, once\nor twice a month, while at bars with friends. Because of a medical condition, Applicant does\nnot consume any alcoholic beverages other than beer. He recently purchased a house and\nhe plans on returning to a technical school to obtain additional training in welding skills. \n       \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1\nthrough \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition\nor factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G (alcohol consumption) with its\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\n\n Department of the Navy v.

Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment\nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] \u00b6 21)  \nApplicant began consuming alcohol while he was still in high school. He was twice\nconvicted of underage drinking in 2004, and of underage drinking and driving in 2005. He\nwas convicted of 4  Degree DWI in April 2007, for an offense that occurred in June 2006.\nth\nDisqualifying Condition (DC): 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent applies.\nApplicant is an unsophisticated young man who appears to have learned a\nconvincing lesson following his 2007 DWI conviction. While he had three prior alcohol-\nrelated offenses, only one of those involved the operation of a motor vehicle and his BAC\nat that time was under the presumptive limit for intoxication. The other two were based\n\n5\nsolely on him consuming alcohol while being underage. He is now of age and he credibly\ntestified that he consumes alcohol responsibly and in moderation. He also credibly testified\nhe never operates a motor vehicle after he has consumed alcohol. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s age at the time he committed the alcohol-related offenses,\nhis steady work history before and after completing welding training, that over three years\nhave passed since his last alcohol related offense, and his overall testimony, appearance,\nand demeanor, I find Mitigating Conditions (MC) 23(a): so much time has passed . . . that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 23(b): the individual acknowledges his . . .\nissues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of . . . responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) apply.\n  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded assessment of\na person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts and\nomissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all\nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis. Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive,\nand the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concern caused by his alcohol consumption. He has overcome the case against\nhim and satisfied his burden of persuasion. Guideline G is decided for  Applicant. It is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a-f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Clearance is denied.\nOn October 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn November 13, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, denying all of the\nallegations except SOR subparagraphs 1.s and 1.t, and requested an administrative\ndetermination. On February 13, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterials (FORM), and DOHA mailed it to Applicant. She received it on February 18,\nJuly 22, 2009\n\nISCR Case No. 03-07826 (App. Bd. June 17, 2005 at 3).\n1\n2\n2009, along with instructions to file any objections or supplementary information within\n30 days. Applicant did not respond, and the case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009.\nProcedural Ruling\nSOR subparagraphs 1.g and 1.k fail to identify specific creditors to whom\nApplicant allegedly is indebted. Although an SOR does not have to satisfy the strict\nrequirements of a criminal indictment, it must still place an applicant on adequate notice\nof the allegations so that she may have a reasonable opportunity to respond and\nprepare a defense.  Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.k. do not meet this minimum threshold;\n1\ntherefore, I conclude that they are not justiciable.\nEvidentiary Rulings\n1. The government must produce evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR\nthat have been controverted (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14). Here, the only evidence the\ngovernment provided to support SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c through 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.m,\n1.n, 1.p, and 1.hh are credit reports noting that the status of these debts was in dispute\n(see generally, Items 5 and 6). These documents fail to satisfy the government\u2019s burden\nof production. Consequently, I have resolved the aforementioned subparagraphs in\nApplicant\u2019s favor, and will not consider them further in the Decision.\n2. SOR subparagraph 1.q alleges a delinquent account for $519. The credit\nbureau report the government provides lists this debt multiple times. Some of the\nlistings note that Applicant has satisfied it (Compare Item 5 at 3 with Item 6 at 19). The\ngovernment has not satisfied its initial burden of production. I have resolved SOR\nsubparagraph 1.q in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 41-year-old, married woman with five children ranging in age from\n16 to 27. A previous marriage ended in divorce in 2002. She has been married to her\ncurrent husband since 2008 (Item 4 at 15). Her educational background is unknown\nfrom the record. Since at least 2000, she has worked as a professional driver (Item 4 at\n5).\nAs of April 2008, Applicant was indebted to 20 creditors on delinquent accounts\ntotalling approximately $9,600 (Items 5 and 6). By May 2008, Applicant had satisfied\nSOR subparagraphs 1.s, an automobile loan for approximate $1,000, and 1.t, a $132\nmedical bill (Item 2 at 5-7). She contends that she has either contacted, or has\nattempted to contact all of the other creditors, and that her ex-husband accrued many of\nthe debts. As for the debts that are her responsibility, Applicant contends she is\nnegotiating payment plans. She provided no documentary evidence supporting these\ncontentions. \n\n3\nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, she alluded to some medical problems (Item 2 at 1). She\ndid not elaborate upon whether these problems contributed to the accrual of her\ndelinquencies.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, as discussed in the Evidentiary Rulings Section, supra).\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant satisfied SOR subparagraphs 1.s and 1.t. I conclude they no\nlonger \nrepresent \na \nsecurity \nconcern. \nThe \nremaining \ndelinquencies, \n(SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.b, 1.h, 1.l, 1.o, 1.p, 1.r, 1.u through 1.gg, and 1.ii) however, trigger the\napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n\n4\nApplicant deserves credit for satisfying the two debts she admitted. Her efforts to\nsatisfy or resolve the others, however, appear to have been limited to phone calls. She\noffered no evidence to support her contention that her ex-husband accrued some of the\ndebts, nor did she offer any evidence to support her contention that she was arranging\npayment plans for the other SOR debts. Absent any documentation regarding these\nremaining delinquencies, I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d\nAbsent sufficient proof that Applicant has rehabilitated her finances, the likelihood\nthat her financial problems will continue is unacceptably high. Upon considering this\ncase in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s troubled\nfinances continue to render her a security risk, as she has not shown any significant\nimprovement in her debt problems.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.i - 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.m -1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.p - 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.s - 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.u - 1.gg:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nSubparagraph 1.hh:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ii:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Coacher, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 10, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn November 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 2, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 31, 2008. Applicant filed a\nresponse to the FORM on February 5, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February\n13, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 23 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant admits that she is indebted to the following creditors in the following\namounts: Target NB $3,137.00; Kay Jewelers $2,287.00; LVNV Funding/Sears\n$1,462.00; AAC/Asset Acceptance/Express $351.00; Sallie Mae $416.00; Sallie Mae\n$263.00; Bank of America/World Wide $6,054.00; and GE Money/Old Navy/AIS\nServices $191.00. All of these debts are delinquent, and all but the Sallie Mae debts\nhave been placed for collection.\nThe Government failed to establish that applicant is indebted as alleged in SOR\nParagraphs 1a, 1b, 1c, 1g, 1k and 1l.\nIn response to the FORM, applicant stated the following:\nI understand that the findings of my credit report are less than desirable. I\nwill be contacting a credit counselor in order to try and resolve these\nissues, as well as working with a financial advisor to insure I do not make\nthe same mistakes again. I have all intentions of repaying my debts.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\n\n3\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay her debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s numerous debts are\nstill outstanding. Her current inability or unwillingness to address them in any meaningful\nway casts doubt on her current judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Accordingly,\nthis mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d There is\nno evidence that applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by conditions largely\nbeyond her control.  Accordingly, this mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. In her response to the FORM, applicant\n\n4\nstated she will be contacting a credit counselor and working with a financial advisor.\nHowever, to date, she has not done anything in terms of counseling. Accordingly, this\nmitigating condition is not applicable.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d There is no\ncredible evidence that applicant has initiated any meaningful action to repay her\ndelinquent debts. This mitigating condition does not apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nhas a history of not meeting her financial obligations. Although she has expressed an\nintent to seek help from a credit counselor and a financial advisor, and to repay her\npast-due debts, to date she has taken no meaningful action to address her financial\ndelinquencies. Based on the foregoing, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns arising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all 12 AG F allegations and denied the one AG E allegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old, never married, and employed as a network specialist by a government contractor. He has a high school diploma and has taken some college courses.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on April 21, 2008. On October 21, 2008, he responded to written \nquestions from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) about his financial \nsituation. On December 18, 2008, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nApril 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 30, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 26, \n2009. I convened a hearing on March 25, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced five exhibits, which \nwere marked Exs. 1 through 5 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced four exhibits, which \nwere marked as Exs. A through D and admitted to the record without objection. \n \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on April 1, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 12 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.l.), and one allegation of disqualifying conduct \nunder AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted all 12 AG F allegations and denied the one AG E allegation. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are included herein as findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old, never married, and employed as a network specialist \nby a government contractor. He has a high school diploma and has taken some college \ncourses. He seeks a security clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 29, 32-33, 83.) \n \n \nApplicant began working for his present employer in March 2008. His annual \nsalary is $78,000. Before taking his job with his present employer, he worked full-time \nfor one year for another employer. From May 2006 until February 2007, he was \nunemployed. He collected unemployment benefits for six of the nine months that he was \nunemployed. He stated that his financial problems began after he was laid off in May \n2006 (Tr. 27-28, 34-38.)   \n \n \nAfter completing his e-QIP in April 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an \nauthorized investigator in June 2008. The investigator discussed Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies with him. Applicant was aware of the delinquencies alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.c., and 1.d. However, he was surprised to learn that a review of his credit \nrevealed so many delinquencies.  (Tr. 39-45.) \n \n \nOn October 15, 2008, Applicant entered an agreement with an on-line consumer \ncredit counseling service to make monthly payments on the debts identified in the SOR \nat \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.l. He provided documentation to \ncorroborate payments on the debts by the credit counseling service in December 2008, \nand January, February, and March 2009. His payment plan anticipates payment of all \ndebts in full in four years. (Ex. 2; Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. C; Tr. 83.)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \n \nThe $19,110 debt identified at SOR \u00b6 1.c represents a loan for the purchase of \nApplicant\u2019s automobile. This loan was charged off and had not been paid as of \nDecember 3, 2008. Applicant currently makes payments on that debt directly from his \nbi-weekly paychecks. He provided documentation to corroborate payments of $325 \ntwice a month In November and December 2008 and January, February, and March \n2009. (Ex. D; Tr. 66-67.)  \n \n \nApplicant intends to work out a plan with the creditor to pay in the future the \ndebts identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. and 1.i. He has spoken with the creditor, and he has \nmade a verbal agreement to send $50 to $250 whenever he can to satisfy the two \ndebts. He has no documentation to corroborate his agreement with the creditor.  (Tr. 69-\n70.)  \n \n \nIn January 2009, Applicant and his housemate fell behind in their rent. Their \nlandlord sued them for unlawful detainer. The court found for the landlord, and Applicant \nand his housemate were required to pay a judgment of $667.93, court costs of $51, and \nattorney fees of $150. (Ex. 3; Tr. 73.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a monthly budget. He \nlisted a net monthly income of $3,800. He listed the following monthly expenses: rent: \n$900; groceries: $300; clothing: $25; utilities: $2051; car expense: $400; medical \nexpenses: $300.2 These expenses did not include his $600 monthly automobile \npayment or his $551 monthly payment to the consumer credit counseling service for the \npayment of his delinquent debts. These figures suggest that Applicant has an \napproximate net monthly remainder of $500 to $600. (Ex. 2; Tr. 61-65.) \n \n \nApplicant completed his e-QIP on April 21, 2008. Section 28 on the e-QIP \nrequests information on an applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies.  Section 28 poses two \nquestions: \u201c(a) In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d and \u201c(b) Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d  Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to both questions.  (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. alleged that Applicant falsified material facts about his debts by \ndenying that he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts and by denying that \nhe had any debts that were over 180 days delinquent in the last seven years. Applicant \ndenied the allegation of falsification.  In his answer to the SOR, he stated: \n \nI deny that it was my intention to falsify material facts on the \nQuestionnaire. I seriously believed that none of my accounts was ever \nmore than 180 days delinquent or that I was currently more than 90 days \ndelinquent on any debt.  For this I apologize and can only state that I have \n \n1 At his hearing, Applicant stated that his utility expenses had been reduced to $125 a month. (Tr. 62.) \n2 Applicant suffers from a terminal illness which requires medication and medical attention.  (Tr. 63.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrecognized my error and made a commitment to set the matter straight \nwith my creditors. \n  \n(Answer to SOR at 2.) \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that his answers to the questions posed \nby Section 28 (a) and 28 (b) were not correct. He stated that when he answered the \nquestions he was not aware of the extent of his financial delinquencies. He denied that \nwhen he answered the questions he was trying to hide the fact that he had certain debts \nthat he knew to be delinquent. I observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor as he made these \nstatements. I conclude that his testimony was credible.  \n \n \n                                                  Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to \npay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d  (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual initiated a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).    \n \nApplicant=s financial delinquencies arose in about May 2006, when he was laid \noff and unemployed for nine months.  Beginning in February 2007, however, he had \nreliable full-time employment, but he took no action to resolve his debts until October \n2008, after his financial delinquencies were brought to his attention in June 2008 in an \ninterview with an authorized investigator. His unresolved debts raise security concerns \nwhich continue to the present day, a situation which raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s \ngood judgment.   \n \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to a four-year payment plan for nine of the \ntwelve debts alleged on the SOR, and he has made at least four monthly payments \nconsistent with his payment plan. However, he has not yet made a commitment to begin \nregular and consistent payment of two additional debts alleged on the SOR. Despite \ngood faith efforts to begin to pay some of his debts, Applicant has not demonstrated a \nrecord of consistent payments made over a period of time. It is not clear at this time that \nhe will be able to manage his finances and avoid financial delinquency in the future. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply in part in mitigation, but that AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nFor this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The \ngovernment established that Applicant omitted material facts from his e-QIP when he \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to parts a and b of Section 28, which asked if he had been over 180 days \ndelinquent on any debt in the last seven years and if he was currently over 90 days \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \ndelinquent on any debt. This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. He denies, however, \nthat he deliberately falsified his answers. When a falsification allegation is controverted, \nthe government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does \nnot establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or \nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.1 For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the \ngovernment must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his \nanswers was deliberate and intentional.2 \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and signed his e-QIP in April 2008, he responded \n\u201cno\u2019\u2019 to parts a and b of Section 28. In a later interview that Applicant had with an \nauthorized investigator, it became clear that he had many old and delinquent debts. \nApplicant denied knowledge of these debts. In his answer to the SOR and at his \nhearing, he explained his thought processes when he was answering Section 28, and \nhe denied that his failure to disclose his financial delinquencies information was \ndeliberate falsification of material facts. \n \nI observed Applicant carefully and listened closely to his explanation for his \nfailure to disclose his financial delinquencies in his answers to Section 28 on his e-QIP.  \nI conclude that his omissions were not deliberate and that he has rebutted Guideline E \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances surrounding that conduct. The administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n1See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-\n23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n2Intention is defined as \u201ca determination to act in a certain way\u201d and intentional is defined as \u201ddone by \nintention or design.\u201d  Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2003). \n\n \n8 \n \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nseveral years ago when he was a mature adult. Even though some of his debts arose \nduring a period of unemployment, he did not address those debts once he was steadily \nemployed. His failure to address these substantial delinquencies over a significant \nperiod of time raises concerns about his judgment and reliability. \n \nTo his credit, Applicant has taken recent action to address a majority of his \ndelinquencies. However, these actions are recent and do not demonstrate a track \nrecord of satisfaction of debt consistently over time. In addition, he has not developed a \npayment plan for two debts listed in the SOR. \n \nApplicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this \ndecision becomes final. If he wishes, he can produce new evidence that addresses the \nGovernment\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nhis financial delinquencies. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.l.: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                        Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",
